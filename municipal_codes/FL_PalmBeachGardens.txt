PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through 
November 17, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each 
section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a 
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By 
use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Ron 
McLaughlin and Jody Wilson, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is 
gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance 
throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Linda V. Kosier, CMC, City Clerk, Bobbie Herakovich, City 
Manager, Thomas J. Baird, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation 
and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those 
of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily 
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's 
affairs.

Gardens as the city council may determine, provided, however, that notice of the time and place of any 
meeting of the city council other than in the city hall shall be posted at least five (5) consecutive days

book kept for that purpose. A copy of any ordinance therefrom, certified to by the clerk under the seal of 
the city, shall be taken and considered in all courts of this state as prima facie evidence that such 
ordinance was duly passed and posted or published as required by law. It shall be the duty of the city 
council to keep a record of all ordinances enacted by it. The council shall post all proposed ordinances at 
the city hall during the period between the first and second readings and it shall promulgate without 
unnecessary delay all ordinances that have been passed, and post the same at the city hall in a book 
kept for that purpose.

private concern the right to construct, maintain and operate public or quasi-public projects for terms not to 
exceed thirty (30) years. No public franchise of any description shall be granted except by ordinance. 
Whenever such an ordinance has been passed upon its first reading by the council, the council shall have 
the same posted publicly in full, entitled "A Proposed Ordinance of the City of Palm Beach Gardens 
Granting a Public Franchise," for a period of thirty (30) days before the council shall take further action 
thereon. If such ordinance is amended after such posting, it shall be considered as again up for the first 
reading. Upon passage the ordinance shall again be posted as herein required.

Code printed in the supplement and make changes in catchlines, headings and titles;

numbers; 
(4) ?Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this 
article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ through _____." The 
inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive 
sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and 
(5) ?Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance 
sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the 
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the 
Code.

deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or 
tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented 
thereby. Any person, firm, or corporation violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-
18 hereof. 
(Code 1987, § 10.15) 


Sec. 1-17. - Remedies. 
    In all cases where fines, penalties, or forfeitures are imposed, they shall be for, and extend and apply 
to, each and every act and omission and for each and every day's continuance of such act or omission, 
when it is of continuing character; and in addition thereto and when the welfare of the city requires it, any

Sec. 2-237. - Administrative fines.

specified in this section.

State Law reference Similar provisions, Section 162.09(1), (2), Florida Statutes. 


Sec. 2-238. - Lien established. 
(a) ?The city may record a certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus costs, in the public 
records of the county. Once recorded, the certified copy of an order shall constitute a lien against the 
land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. 
Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court 
judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property of the violator, but 
such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine 
imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or 
until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever 
occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and 
the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. 
(b) ?After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate 
may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the 
amount of lien plus accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may 
be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the state 
constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real or personal 
property which is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the state constitution. Actions for money 
judgments may be pursued only on fines levied after October 1, 2000. 
(c) ?Such lien shall be superior to all other liens, except liens for taxes, and shall bear interest at the rate 
of ten (10) percent per annum from the date recorded.

State Law reference Similar provisions, Section 162.09(3), Florida Statutes. 


Sec. 2-239. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided under this division shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified 
copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action pursuant to 
subsection 2-238(b) is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien 
or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee, that it incurs in the action. The city council shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in 
recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the 
action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without 
notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

State Law reference Similar provisions, Section 162.10, Florida Statutes. 


Sec. 2-240. - Appeal. 
    Any aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final administrative order of the special 
magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to 
appellate review of the record created before the special magistrate. An appeal shall be considered timely 
if it was filed within thirty (30) days of the rendering of a written order. The timely filing of an appeal shall 
not stay the accrual of any fines ordered to be paid pursuant to section 2-237. The city clerk may assess 
a reasonable charge for the preparation of the record to be paid by the petitioner in accordance with 
Section 119.07, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 5, 2011, § 2, 4-7-11)

address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, or to any other address provided by the 
property owner in writing to the local government for the purpose of receiving notices. For property 
owned by a corporation, notices may be provided by certified mail to the registered agent of the 
corporation. If any notice sent by certified mail is not signed as received within thirty (30) days after

hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person 
designated by the city council; by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with 
any person residing therein who is above fifteen (15) years of age and informing such person of the 
contents of the notice; or in the case of commercial premises, by leaving the notice with the manager 
or other person in charge. 
(b) ?In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the 
special magistrate, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1) ?Such notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks (four (4)

newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under Chapter 50, Florida Statutes 
for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in Sections 
50.041 and 50.051, Florida Statutes.

posted at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline 
contained in the notice, in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property upon 
which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting 
shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the 
notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(c) ?Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to 
provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
(d) ?Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection 
(a) of this section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) of this 
section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this article have been met, without 
regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(Ord. No. 5, 2011, § 2, 4-7-11; Ord. No. 3, 2013, § 3, 2-7-13) 


Sec. 2-242. - Procedure for reduction of fines and liens. 
(a) ?The owner of real property against which a fine or lien has been imposed may apply in writing to the 
special magistrate for a reduction of fine or satisfaction of lien with less than full payment thereof. 
(b) ?The property owner/violator may not request and the special magistrate shall not consider any such 
application for a reduction of fine or lien unless the applicant demonstrates that: 
(1) ?All ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, city utility charges, and other government-
imposed liens against the subject real property have been paid; 
(2) ?The applicant is not personally indebted to the City of Palm Beach Gardens for any reason; 
and 
(3) ?The applicant is not in violation of any city codes at the time of such application. 
(c) ?The special magistrate may reduce a fine or lien provided good cause is shown for such reduction. 
The balance of any fine or lien that is reduced by the special magistrate shall be paid on such terms 
as approved by the special magistrate. An order entered pursuant to this section shall not constitute 
a final administrative order for purposes of appeal; the special magistrate's decision on an 
application to reduce a fine or lien is final.

--- (12) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, adopted April 15, 2004, amended art. XII in its entirety to read as 
herein set out. Formerly, said article pertained to similar subject matter as enacted by Ord. No. 25-1996, 
§§ 126, adopted Feb. 6, 1997. 


Sec. 3-126. - Definitions. 
(a) ?As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and 
phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions with interest at the rate of six 
percent per annum. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to 
the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the 
applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required 
actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in 
accumulated contributions without the crediting of interest of six percent per annum. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the 1983 Group 
Annuity Mortality Table and an interest rate of eight percent per annum. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average salary of the three best 
consecutive years of the last five years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, 
or the career average as a full-time general employee, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 
consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a 
member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no 
such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the 
member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein 
provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a 
general employee with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or 
completed months when such member was not employed by the city as a general employee. A 
member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years 
after leaving the employ of the city pending the possibility of being rehired, and remaining employed 
for a period of not less than three years, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of 
the system. If a member who is not vested does not remain employed for a period of three years 
upon reemployment within five years, then his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, will be 
returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated 
contributions, if more than $1,000.00 will be returned only upon the written request of the member 
and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum 
amount on forms designated by the board. If a vested member leaves the employ of the city, his 
accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. Upon return of his 
accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and 
terminated. 
    Effective date means February 6, 1997. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    General employee means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of the 
city, including those in their initial probationary employment period, but not including certified police 
officers and certified firefighters employed by the city. 
    Member means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed membership 
requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to 
the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the 
future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who 
retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such 
ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the 
following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate 
receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city, reportable on the 
member's W-2 form, plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from 
elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. Compensation in excess of limitations set 
forth in Section 401 (a)(17) of the Code shall be disregarded. The limitation on compensation for an 
"eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account 
hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member 
before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995.

and for making effective the provisions of this article are hereby vested in a board of trustees. The 
board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist of three trustees: one 
of whom shall be a member of the system, a retiree or, if a member or retiree is unwilling or unable 
to serve, the human resources director or his/her designee; one of whom shall be the city manager 
or his/her designee; and one of whom shall be the finance administrator or his/her designee. The

the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and 
per diem as provided by law. 
(c) ?Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Two affirmative votes shall be necessary for 
any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall have the right to abstain

(d) ?The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to 
transact the business of the system. The board is authorized to enter into a contract with the Florida 
Municipal Pension Trust Fund for administration and investment management services. The 
compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary 
for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the 
board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other 
professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to 
the board. 
(e) ?The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the

Sec. 3-129. - Finances and fund management. 
    Establishment and operation of fund. 
(a) ?As part of the system, there is hereby established the fund, into which shall be deposited all of 
the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system, including the assets of the 
prior retirement plan for general employees of the city, including the assets from any previous 
group annuity contract. 
(b) ?The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the 
board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing 
agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(c) ?All funds of the general employees' pension plan (DB) may be deposited by the board with the 
finance administrator of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the 
same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. 
However, any funds so deposited with the finance administrator of the city shall be kept in a 
separate fund by the finance administrator or clearly identified as such funds of the general 
employees' pension plan (DB). In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the general 
employees' pension plan (DB) in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which 
depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of 
F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may 
retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment 
Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance 
company, the Florida Municipal Pension Trust Fund, or a combination of these, for the purposes 
of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, 
subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(d) ?All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate 
records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including 
accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(1) ?Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and 
aggregate account basis; 
(2) ?Receipts and disbursements;

contributions and deposits from the city; 
(5) ?All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
(6) ?Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete 
financial report of the fund. 
(e) ?An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal 
year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and 
disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the 
assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of 
assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified 
audit. 
(f) ?The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1) ?The board shall be vested with full legal title to the assets of the plan, subject, however, 
and in any event to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this 
system, provided that no amendment or system termination shall ever result in the use of 
any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this 
system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into 
the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall 
be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be 
required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2) ?All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and 
the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be limited to: 
a. ?Annuity and life insurance contracts with life insurance companies in amounts 
sufficient to provide, in whole or in part, the benefits to which all of the members in the 
fund shall be entitled under the provisions of this system and pay the initial and 
subsequent premium thereon. 
b. ?Time or savings accounts of a national bank, a state bank insured by the Bank 
Insurance Fund or a savings/building and loan association insured by the Savings 
Association Insurance Fund which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation or a state or federal chartered credit union whose share accounts are 
insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. 
c. ?Obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest 
by the government of the United States or by an agency of the government of the 
United States. 
d. ?Individual bonds, stocks and commingled or mutual funds. 
e. ?Open-end, noncommission bank or insurance company real estate fund with ability to 
liquidate every three months. 
f. ?Foreign securities. 
(3) ?The board shall not invest more than five percent of its assets in the common stock, 
capital stock, or convertible securities of any one issuing company, nor shall the aggregate 
investment in any one issuing company exceed five percent of the outstanding capital 
stock of that company; nor shall the aggregate of its investments in common stock, capital 
stock and convertible securities at cost exceed 65 percent of the assets of the fund. 
(4) ?The board shall not invest more than five percent at cost of its assets in open-end, 
noncommission bank or insurance company real estate funds. 
(5) ?At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board 
shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant to evaluate the performance 
of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of 
all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board 
at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(6) ?The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund 
as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(7) ?Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any 
investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of 
the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good 
faith. 
(8) ?The board may cause any investment securities held by it to be registered in or 
transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it 
may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and 
records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(9) ?The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities 
of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of 
attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, 
recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to 
deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee 
with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fall to amortize any 
part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; 
and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or 
other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the 
fund to exercise. 
(10) ?The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, 
nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(11) ?Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is 
required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it 
as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it 
from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction 
or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in falling to take such action or perform 
such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been 
received by it. 
(12) ?Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary 
caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum 
approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to 
which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. 
Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or 
collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in 
a prudent manner. 
(13) ?The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the 
payments and benefits herein provided for. 
(14) ?In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a 
necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be 
entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or 
action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(15) ?Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or 
carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all 
times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, 
that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04; Ord. No. 40, 2009, § 2, 1-7-10) 


Sec. 3-130. - Contributions. 
(a) ?Member contributions. 
(1) ?Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the 
fund in the amount of six percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on 
behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board at least monthly. The contributions 
made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to 
Section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being 
excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other 
purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2) ?Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b) ?City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to 
the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year, between the total aggregate member 
contributions for the year, and the total cost for the year, as shown by the most recent actuarial 
valuation of the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the 
additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in Part VII, 
F.S. ch. 112. 
(c) ?Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits 
must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from 
these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, 
and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-131. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a) ?Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month 
coincident with or next following attainment of age 62, regardless of years of credited service. 
A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and 
each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal 
retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from the city on or after the normal 
retirement date. 
(b) ?Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall 
receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month next following his 
retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime and ceasing upon death, but with 
120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal two and 
one-half percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(c) ?Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day 
of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 55 and the completion of ten 
years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the 
city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d) ?Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive 
either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal 
retirement as follows: 
(1) ?A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his 
normal retirement date had he continued employment as a general employee and shall be 
continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly 
retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal 
retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be 
determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2) ?An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date 
and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as 
determined in paragraph (1) above, reduced by one-fifteenth for each of the first five years and 
one-thirtieth for each of the next five years by which the commencement of benefits precedes 
the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued 
employment as a general employee. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-132. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a) ?Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased, actively employed 
member who was not receiving benefits or was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal 
retirement shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b) ?Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement. The beneficiary of any member who dies while 
actively employed and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal 
retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1) ?If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary shall 
receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would 
have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit 
shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's vested 
percentage, credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and 
reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The beneficiary may also elect to receive an 
immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the 
commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2) ?If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary shall 
receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the 
member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, at the 
option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the 
deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his 
death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3) ?A beneficiary may elect an optional form of benefit as provided for in section 3-135 and the 
board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 3-135, subsection (g). 
(4) ?A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a 
refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-133. - Disability. 
(a) ?Disability benefits. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent 
that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render 
useful and efficient service as a general employee in his current position or in another position that 
the city makes available to him, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be 
entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-half percent of his average final compensation 
multiplied by his total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are 
not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may 
apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(b) ?Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall 
establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1) ?Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2) ?Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil 
insurrections. 
(3) ?Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4) ?Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(5) ?Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a general employee with the city shall have 
terminated. 
(6) ?Willful, wanton or intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the member. 
(7) ?Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and 
arising out of such employment. 
(8) ?A condition preexisting the general employee's membership in the system. No member shall be 
entitled to a disability pension because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, 
impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of membership in the system, 
provided that such pre-existing condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or 
other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing herein shall 
be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after membership in the 
system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, 
impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to said membership. 
(c) ?Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until 
and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or 
surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select 
the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the 
board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board 
to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the 
retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required to undergo additional periodic re-
examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be 
selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the 
retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful 
and efficient service as a general employee, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be 
returned to performance of duty as a general employee, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the 
same rights that member had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so 
ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he 
shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree 
receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by 
the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and 
hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a general employee, his 
service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for 
which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the 
service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability 
claims. 
(d) ?Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's 
disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines 
such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board 
determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the 
first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1) ?If the retiree recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due 
next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2) ?If the retiree dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal retirement date while 
still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, 
whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which 
benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 3-135, 
subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(e) ?Benefit offset. When a member is receiving a disability pension, workers' compensation benefits 
pursuant to F.S., Chapter 440, Social Security benefits or any other salary continuation program 
provided by the city, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from all sources 
(but considering only 50 percent of Social Security benefits as an offset) exceed 100 percent of the 
member's final monthly salary, excluding overtime, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so 
that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed 100 percent of such salary. 
The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent 
monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-134. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a general employee, either voluntarily or by discharge, 
and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1) ?If the member has less than five years credited service upon termination, the member shall be 
entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with 
the fund. 
(2) ?Every member who has attained his normal retirement date shall be fully vested in his accrued 
retirement benefit regardless of his credited service. Except as otherwise provided herein, each 
member not otherwise fully vested shall have a minimum vested interest in the amount of his 
accrued benefit equal to the percentage thereof, as hereinafter indicated, applicable to the 
number of his years of credited service:

Each member shall at all times and in all events have a fully vested interest in his accumulated 
contributions. No member's vested interest is to be reduced as a result of any amendment to 
this section; however, any increase in a member's vested interest will be determined by the 
vesting schedule in effect at the time of his separation from service. 
(3) ?If the member has five or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be 
entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early 
retirement and based upon the percentage of vested interest, the member's credited service, 
average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to 
him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, provided he does not 
elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided member survives to his otherwise 
normal or early retirement date. If a member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions 
and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated 
beneficiary or his spouse at the time of his death shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein 
for a deceased member under section 3-132, pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-135. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a) ?In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early 
retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a 
retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the 
following options: 
(1) ?A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the member for his lifetime only. 
(2) ?A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member during the lifetime 
of the member and following the death of the member, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent 
or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where 
the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage 
of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the 
applicable table in the treasury regulations. 
(3) ?If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect 
to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be 
assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an 
extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The 
amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the 
social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b) ?The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection 
(a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system 
in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to 
time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where 
applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's 
retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated 
beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and 
the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto 
and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change; provided however, in no event may a 
member change his or her designated joint pensioner more than twice. 
(c) ?The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not 
be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the 
system shall thereupon cease. 
(d) ?Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the 
retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age 
and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree. Any such retiree shall 
pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form 
prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated 
beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree 
subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 3-136. 
(e) ?Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the 
provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1) ?If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first 
occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if 
any, will be determined under section 3-132. 
(2) ?If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's 
retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement 
income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if 
the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the 
provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his 
retirement. 
(3) ?If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die 
before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period 
certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in 
its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum 
and in accordance with section 3-131. 
(4) ?If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 
3-131, subsection (a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant 
to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, 
or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) 
designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired 
under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(f) ?A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first 
retirement check. 
(g) ?Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a 
lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the monthly benefit 
amount is less than $100.00 or the total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments 
to be paid do not exceed $5,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power 
and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete 
discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to 
review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

Sec. 3-136. - Beneficiaries. 
(a) ?Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, 
designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the 
event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by 
signing and filing with the board a new designation of beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights 
of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b) ?If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection 
(a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the 
member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to 
such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree, and the 
board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits 
be paid in a lump sum. 
(c) ?If a beneficiary dies before all of the guaranteed monthly payments have been paid, and there is no 
designated contingent beneficiary, the remaining number of monthly payments will be paid to the 
beneficiary's estate in a single lump sum payment. 
(d) ?Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of 
all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with 
rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and 
conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-137. - Claims procedures. 
(a) ?The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written 
requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), 
including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b) ?The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's 
claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A 
reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth 
in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-138. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions 
of this section in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall 
cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to 
show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-139. - Maximum pension. 
(a) ?Basic limitation. Subject to the adjustments hereinafter set forth, the maximum amount of annual 
retirement income payable with respect to a member under this system shall not exceed 
$160,000.00. For purposes of applying the above limitation, benefits payable in any form other than 
a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by treasury regulations, 
so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this 
section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
(1) ?Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2) ?Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be 
taken into account for purposes of the limitation of § 415(b)(1) of the Code. 
(b) ?Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this section with respect to any member 
who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in § 414(j) of the 
Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all defined benefit 
plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(c) ?Adjustments in limitations. 
(1) ?In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the $160,000.00 
limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by 
the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of § 415(b) of the Code, so that such 
limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income 
benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2) ?The reductions provided for in (1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid 
pursuant to section 3-133, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 3-132. 
(3) ?If the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining 
whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be 
adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment 
shall be made using an assumed interest rate of five percent and shall be made in accordance 
with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
(d) ?Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any 
member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount 
determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The 
reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to 
section 3-133, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 3-132. 
(e) ?$10,000.00 limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a 
member shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable, 
with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension 
plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for 
any prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in 
which the member participated. 
(f) ?Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall 
be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which 
member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most 
recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the 
plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for 
defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with 
respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as 
shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, 
that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement 
of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(g) ?Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated in subsections (a), (b) and (c) herein shall be 
adjusted to the time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments 
prescribed by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. 
(h) ?Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1) ?The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the 
system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, 
shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in 
this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable 
to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2) ?No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is 
in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already 
receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's 
retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal 
benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-140. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a) ?General rules. 
(1) ?Effective date. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required 
minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2) ?Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent 
provisions of the plan. 
(3) ?Requirements of Treasury regulations incorporated. All distributions required under this section 
will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury regulations under section 
401(a)(9) of the Code. 
(4) ?TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other 
than this subsection (a)(4), distributions may be made under a designation made before 
January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of 
TEFRA. 
(b) ?Time and manner of distribution. 
(1) ?Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be 
distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not 
be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the 
member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member retires, unless otherwise 
provided for in the plan or required by law. 
(2) ?Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the 
member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a. ?If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then 
distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year 
immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 31 of 
the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½, if later. 
b. ?If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then 
distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year 
immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c. ?If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of 
the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the 
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d. ?If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the 
surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse 
begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving 
spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2) and subsection (e), distributions are considered to 
begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date 
of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If 
annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required 
beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are 
required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions 
are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3) ?Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity 
purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning 
date, as of the first distribution calendar year, distributions will be made in accordance with 
subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of 
an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in 
accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. 
Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in 
section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 
401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c) ?Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1) ?General annuity requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity 
distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a. ?The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than 
one year. 
b. ?The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than 
the period described in subsection (d) or (e). 
c. ?Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed 
even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted. 
d. ?Payments will either be nonincreasing or increase only as follows: 
1. ?By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the cumulative annual 
percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and 
issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or by a fixed annual increase of five percent 
or less. 
2. ?To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the member's payments to provide for 
a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to 
determine the distribution period described in subsection (d) dies or is no longer the 
member's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the 
meaning of section 414(p). 
3. ?To provide cash refunds of accumulated contributions upon the member's death. 
4. ?To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
(2) ?Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be 
distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before 
distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (b)(2)a. or 
(b)(2)c.) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not 
be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next 
calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-
monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last 
day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the 
annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning 
date. 
(3) ?Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the 
member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning 
with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar 
year in which such amount accrues. 
(d) ?Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during a member's lifetime. 
(1) ?Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the member's spouse. If the member's interest 
is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member 
and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's required 
beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death must not at any time 
exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been 
payable to the member using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the 
Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint 
lives of the member and a nonspouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirements 
in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated 
beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(2) ?Period certain annuities. Unless the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and 
the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity 
distribution commencing during the member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable 
distribution period for the member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting 
date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the member reaches age 70, the 
applicable distribution period for the member is the distribution period for age 70 under the 
Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the 
excess of 70 over the age of the member as of the member's birthday in the year that contains 
the annuity starting date. If the member's spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary 
and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not 
exceed the longer of the member's applicable distribution period, as determined under this 
subsection (d)(2), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the member's 
spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 
of the Treasury regulations, using the member's and spouse's attained ages as of the member's 
and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(e) ?Requirements for minimum distributions where member dies before date distributions begin. 
(1) ?Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date distribution of 
his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest will 
be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subsection (b)(2)a. or (b)(2)b., over 
the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
a. ?Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life 
expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the 
beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the 
member's death. 
b. ?If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy 
of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's 
birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(2) ?No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date distributions begin and there is 
no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's 
death, distribution of the member's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the 
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(3) ?Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. If the member dies 
before the date distribution of his interest begins, the member's surviving spouse is the 
member's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the 
surviving spouse begin, this subsection (e) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the 
member, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without 
regard to subsection (b)(2)a. 
(f) ?Definitions. 
(1) ?Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and 
is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, 
Q&A-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
(2) ?Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For 
distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the 
calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required 
beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution 
calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to 
subsection (b)(2). 
(3) ?Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(4) ?Required beginning date. The date specified in subsection (b)(1).

Sec. 3-141. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a) ?Interest of members in system. At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system 
with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus 
or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b) ?No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council 
of the city which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a 
member's beneficiaries. 
(c) ?Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified pension plan under 
the applicable provisions of the code, as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or 
amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or 
maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as 
now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, 
as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d) ?Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to 
reduce future city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 11-2004, § 1, 4-15-04) 


Sec. 3-142. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a) ?This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system 
and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any 
subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting 
hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal 
shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent 
that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b) ?If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a 
transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 
121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this 
article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement 
allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for 
in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of 
contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there 
shall be full vesting 100 percent of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the system 
shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons 
so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(c) ?The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system as of 
the date of repeal of this article, or if contributions to the system are discontinued with the date of 
such discontinuation being determined by the board. 
(1) ?Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retiree receiving a retirement or disability 
benefit hereunder on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a 
retired or disabled (but since deceased) member, and each member who has, by such date, 
become eligible for normal retirement but has not yet retired, an amount which is the actuarial 
equivalent of such benefit, provided that, if such asset value be less than the aggregate of such 
amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced 
amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
(2) ?If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionment under paragraph (1), 
apportionment shall next be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such 
date who is vested and who is not entitled to an apportionment under paragraph (1), in the 
amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal 
retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), based on the credited service 
and average final compensation as of such date, and each vested former member then entitled 
to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments, in the 
amount required to provide said actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal 
retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), provided that, if such remaining 
asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter 
amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will 
be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(3) ?If there be any asset value after the apportionments under paragraphs (1) and (2), 
apportionment shall be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date 
who is not entitled to an apportionment under paragraphs (1) and (2) in the amount equal to 
member's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than 
the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder such latter amount shall be 
proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such 
remaining asset value. 
(4) ?If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionments under paragraphs (1), (2), and 
(3), apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member included in paragraph (3) 
above to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of the non-vested accrued normal retirement 
benefit, less the amount apportioned in paragraph (3), based on the credited service and 
average final compensation as of such date, provided that, if such remaining asset value be 
less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such amounts shall be reduced 
so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(5) ?In the event that there be asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in 
paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), such excess shall be returned to the city. 
The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be 
carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits 
determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the 
persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable 
manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of 
subsequent distributions. 
If, at any time during the first ten years after the effective date of the ordinance originally 
establishing this system, the system shall be terminated or the full current costs of the system 
shall not have been met, anything in the system to the contrary notwithstanding, city 
contributions which may be used for the benefit of any one of the 25 highest paid members on 
the effective date, whose anticipated annual retirement allowance provided by the city's 
contributions at member's normal retirement date would exceed $1,500.00, shall not exceed the 
greater of either a) $20,000.00, or b), an amount computed by multiplying the smaller of 
$10,000.00 or 20 percent of such member's average annual earnings during his last five years 
of service by the number of years of service since the effective date. In the event that it shall 
hereafter be determined by statute, court decision, ruling by the commissioner of internal 
revenue, or otherwise, that the provisions of this paragraph are not then necessary to qualify the 
system under the code, this paragraph shall be ineffective without the necessity of further 
amendment of this article. 
(d) ?After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other 
liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund 
of the city.

Sec. 3-143. - Exemption from execution, non-assignability. 
    Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or 
accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions and the

employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the

otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made 
from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written

licensed laboratory that regularly performs soil testing and recommendations. 
    Best management practices (BMPs) means turf and landscape practices or combination of practices 
based on research, field-testing, and expert review, determined to be the most effective and practical site-
specific means, including economic and technological considerations, for improving water quality,

any person who applies fertilizer for payment or other consideration to property not owned by the person 
or firm applying the fertilizer, or the employer of the applicators. 
    Fertilizing or fertilization means the act of applying fertilizer to turf, specialized turf, or landscape 
plants. 
    Fertilizer means any substance or mixture of substances that contains one (1) or more recognized 
plant nutrients and promotes plant growth, or controls soil acidity or alkalinity, or provides other soil 
enrichment, or provides other corrective measures to the soil. 
    Institutional applicator means any person, other than a private, noncommercial or a commercial 
applicator (unless such definitions also apply under the circumstances), that applies fertilizer for the 
purpose of maintaining turf and/or landscape plants. Institutional applicators shall include, but shall not be

(Ord. No. 20, 2011, § 2, 1-5-2012) 


Sec. 34-35. - Legislative findings. 
    As a result of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's determination that certain water 
bodies within Palm Beach County are impaired by excessive nutrient levels, the City Council of the City of 
Palm Beach Gardens finds that the best management practices contained in the most recent edition of 
the "Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green 
Industries", are required and are necessary to implement within the city as set forth herein. 
(Ord. No. 20, 2011, § 3, 1-5-2012) 


Sec. 34-36. - Purpose and intent. 
    This division regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of 
commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; 
establishes a prohibited application period; and specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and 
methods, fertilizer-free zones, and exemptions. This division requires the use of best management 
practices to minimize negative environmental effects associated with excessive nutrients in our water 
bodies. These environmental effects have been observed in and on Palm Beach County's natural and 
constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, lakes, estuaries, and other water bodies. 
Collectively, these water bodies are an asset important to the environmental, recreational, cultural, and 
economic well-being of Palm Beach County residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae 
and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed 
stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in 
fertilizer, is anticipated to help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. 
(Ord. No. 20, 2011, § 4, 1-5-2012) 


Sec. 34-37. - Applicability. 
    The regulations set forth herein shall be applicable to and shall regulate any and all applicators of 
fertilizer and areas of application of fertilizer to urban landscapes within the area of the City of Palm 
Beach Gardens, unless such application is specifically exempted by Section 34-44. These regulations

plants during the prohibited application period or to saturated soils. 
(b) ?Fertilizer containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus shall not be applied before seeding or sodding a 
site, and shall not be applied for the first thirty (30) days after seeding, except when hydro-seeding 
for temporary or permanent erosion control in an emergency situation (wildfire, etc.), or in 
accordance with the stormwater pollution prevent plan for that site. 
(Ord. No. 20, 2011, § 6, 1-5-2012) 


Sec. 34-39. - Fertilizer-free zones.

Department of Environmental Protection (Chapter 62-340), Florida Administrative Code, or from the top of 
a seawall or lake bulkhead. Newly planted turf or landscape plants may be fertilized in this zone only for a 
sixty-day period beginning thirty (30) days after planting if needed to allow the plants to become well 
established. Caution shall be used to prevent direct deposition of nutrients into the water.

portion of the fund. 
b. ?All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the 
investment of all or any part of such funds shall be limited to: 
1. ?Annuity and life insurance contracts with life insurance companies in amounts sufficient to 
provide, in whole or in part, the benefits to which all of the members in the fund shall be 
entitled under the provisions of this system and pay the initial and subsequent premium 
thereon. 
2. ?Time or savings accounts of a national bank, a state bank insured by the bank insurance

the aggregate investment in any one (1) issuing company exceed five percent (5%) of

investment vehicles, including private placement open end funds, exchange traded funds 
(ETFs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), mutual funds, annuity funds, and insurance 
company pooled funds under the group annuity contract as recommended by the financial

7. ?In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, 
make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service 
Revenue Ruling 81-100 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import. 
8. ?The board shall identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in

h. ?Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required 
to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee 
under this division, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a

Ord. No. 20, 2010, § 3, 9-16-10) 


Sec. 38-55. - Contributions. 
(1) ?Member contributions. 
a. ?Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund 
in the amount of six (6) percent of his or her salary, which shall be picked up by the employer, 
plus, commencing on October 1, 2003, and annually each October 1st thereafter, an additional 
two (2) percent contribution of his or her salary resulting from the deduction from share account 
allocations provided in subsection 38-78(2)a. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, effective 
October 1, 2012, the member contribution shall be increased by 4.8 percent of salary (equal to 
a total increase of five hundred seven thousand six hundred thirty-four dollars ($507,634.00) for 
all contributing members). Also effective on October 1, 2012, and immediately following the 
increase in the member contribution provided in the preceding sentence, and on each October 1 
thereafter, the total amount of premium tax revenues received by the city in excess of two (2) 
percent of the total salaries of all members during the prior plan year but not to exceed five 
hundred seven thousand six hundred thirty-four dollars ($507,634.00), shall be used to reduce 
the member contribution back to six (6) percent of salary, and shall not be allocated to member 
share accounts as provided in subsection 38-78(2)a., such that there is no change in the six (6) 
percent member contribution; resulting in a reduction in the city's annual required contribution 
equal to the amount of excess premium tax revenues used to reduce the member contribution 
each year. If the excess premium tax revenue received by the city in any year is not sufficient to 
reduce the member contribution back to six (6) percent of salary, then the city shall be 
responsible for funding the difference in the amount of the excess premium tax revenues 
received and the cost of bringing the employee contribution back to six (6) percent of salary. 
b. ?Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2) ?State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for 
the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city shall be 
deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more 
than five days after receipt by the city. State monies shall be allocated to member share accounts 
pursuant to section 38-79. 
(3) ?City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to 
the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year, between the total aggregate member 
contributions for the year and the total cost for the year, as shown by the most recent actuarial 
valuation of the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the 
additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in Part VII of 
Chapter 112, Florida Statutes. 
(4) ?Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits 
must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from 
these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, 
and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 11-2000, § 4, 4-6-00; Ord. No. 8-2004, § 1, 4-15-04; 
Ord. No. 23, 2012, § 3, 9-13-12) 


Sec. 38-56. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(1) ?Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month 
coincident with, or next following attainment of age 52 and the completion of ten years of credited 
service or upon completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. A member may retire 
on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall 
become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal 
retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal 
retirement date. 
(2) ?Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his or her normal retirement date 
shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month next following his 
or her retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 
one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement 
benefit for members retiring before January 1, 2004, shall equal 2.75 percent of average final 
compensation, for each year of credited service; provided, however, that the benefit shall not exceed 
seventy-five (75) percent of average final compensation but shall, in any event, average at least two 
(2) percent for each year of credited service. The monthly retirement benefit for members retiring on 
or after January 1, 2004, shall equal three (3) percent of average final compensation for each year of 
credited service; provided, however, that the benefit shall not exceed ninety-nine (99) percent of 
average final compensation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the monthly retirement benefit 
for members retiring on or after the effective date of this ordinance shall equal three (3) percent of 
average final compensation for each year of credited service, provided, however, that the benefit 
shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of average final compensation. In the event a member 
who retires on or after the effective date of this ordinance has, as of that date, accrued a benefit in 
excess of seventy-five (75) percent of average final compensation, the member shall retain the 
benefit percentage accrued as of the effective date of this ordinance, but shall not accrue any 
additional benefit after that date. Provided, the seventy-five (75) percent of average final 
compensation maximum benefit shall not apply to members who were employed on the effective 
date of this ordinance and had reached age fifty-two (52) with ten (10) or more years of credited 
service or twenty-five (25) years of credited service on that date. 
(3) ?Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day 
of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten 
years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the 
city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(4) ?Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive 
either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal 
retirement as follows: 
a. ?A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month 
following attainment of age 52 and on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of 
each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for 
retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final 
compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
b. ?An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date 
and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as 
determined in paragraph a above, which is reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which 
the commencement of benefits precedes age fifty-two (52). 
(5) ?Deferred retirement option program (DROP). A deferred retirement option program shall be 
available to members of this plan, which program shall be administered by the board in accordance 
with the following provisions: 
a. ?Eligibility. A member may enter into the DROP on the first day of the month following the 
attainment of normal retirement age as defined in section 38-56 herein. 
Members who attained eligibility prior to the enactment of the DROP shall be afforded the option 
of participating immediately or retroactively to the date that they actually attained eligibility, 
provided, however, that this option must be exercised no later than ninety (90) days after the 
board provides notice of this option to the affected member. 
b. ?Written election. A member electing to participate in the DROP must complete and execute the 
proper application form which shall be supplied by the board. Election into the DROP shall be 
irrevocable once a member submits the application to enter the DROP. 
c. ?Limitation/disqualification for other benefits. A member may participate in the DROP only once. 
After commencement of participation in the DROP, the member shall no longer earn or accrue 
additional vesting credits toward retirement benefits and shall not be eligible for disability, pre-
retirement death, or partial lump sum distribution benefits from the fund. 
d. ?Cessation or reduction of contributions. Upon the effective date of a member's commencement 
of participation in the DROP, all contributions on behalf of the member to the fund shall be 
discontinued. 
e. ?Benefit calculation. For purposes of this plan, the service and vesting credits of a member 
participating in the DROP shall remain as they existed on the effective date of commencement 
of participation in the DROP. The member shall not earn or be credited with any additional 
vesting credits after beginning DROP participation. Service thereafter shall not be recognized by 
the fund or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by such fund. 
The average final compensation of the member shall remain as it existed on the effective date 
of commencement of participation in the DROP. Payment for accrued unused leave (vacation, 
holiday, etc.) shall be made, at the option of the member, from one (1) of the following choices: 
1. ?When commencing participation in the DROP; or 
2. ?As the leave is actually used during participation in the DROP; or 
3. ?When the participant actually terminates employment with the city. 
f. ?Payments to DROP account. The monthly retirement benefits, including any future cost of living 
increases, that would have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and 
receive a normal retirement benefit shall be deposited into the member's DROP account. 
g. ?DROP account earnings. Earnings of each DROP account shall be credited or debited at the 
end of each fiscal year quarter at the actual rate of investment return achieved by the fund for 
that fiscal year quarter net of expenses and costs. 
As an alternative, each current member of the DROP and each future member of the DROP 
may elect, instead of receiving the "net investment return" as set forth above, to direct a one-
time irrevocable election, at any time during the DROP period, that his or her DROP account be 
invested in a fixed rate money market fund as may be made available from time to time by the 
board. The electing member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the 
net rate of investment return realized by such money market fund. Furthermore, the board of 
trustees may implement a self-directed account option for members who participate in the 
deferred retirement option plan. Prior to implementing the self-directed account option, the 
board of trustees must adopt a separate investment policy for such accounts and approve such 
investment managers and products for the self-directed account option that the board of 
trustees determines to be prudent. The board of trustees may change such investment 
managers and products from time to time as it deems prudent to do so. Members may elect the 
self-directed account option as follows: (a) members who are participating in the DROP as of 
the effective date of Ordinance 2, 2013 may elect in writing to the board the self-directed 
account option within ninety (90) days following the enactment of Ordinance 2, 1013 (b); 
members who enter the DROP after the effective date of Ordinance 2, 2013 may elect the self-
directed account option prior to entering the DROP; or (c) any DROP member who does not 
elect the self-directed account option in accordance with (a) or (b) above may elect the self-
directed account option one-time only at any time prior to the fourth anniversary of entering the 
DROP. A member who elects the self-directed account option may revoke that election at any 
time after one (1) year following election of the self-directed account option but shall not 
thereafter be eligible for the self-directed option. Members who elect the self-directed account 
option shall direct the board of trustees to invest their self-directed DROP account in any of the 
managers and products approved by the board, in accordance with an agreement between the 
members and the investment manager or product provider. A member's self-directed DROP 
account shall be credited with earnings or debited with losses based on the performance of the 
investments selected by the member. Neither the board of trustees nor the city shall be liable for 
the performance of the investment managers or products selected, and the performance of self-
directed DROP accounts shall not result in any increased costs to the plan or increased 
contributions by the city. 
h. ?Maximum participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP on a date equal or 
subsequent to the participant's normal retirement date may participate for a maximum of sixty 
(60) months. At the conclusion of the maximum time period, the member's covered city 
employment must terminate pursuant to the resignation submitted by the member as part of the 
DROP application. The member may terminate DROP participation by advancing his or her 
resignation from covered city employment to a date prior to that submitted by the member as 
part of the DROP application. 
i. ?Expenses. Each member's DROP account shall be charged an administrative fee to compensate 
the fund for costs and expenses of administering the DROP. Such administrative fee shall be 
established by the board and shall not exceed one-half (0.5) percent. 
j. ?Payout. 
1. ?Upon the termination of a member's covered city employment (for any reason, whether by 
retirement, resignation, discharge, or death), the retirement benefits payable to the 
member or to the member's beneficiary (if the member selected an optional form of 
retirement benefit which provides for payments to the beneficiary) shall be paid to the 
member, the member's beneficiary, or the member's estate and shall no longer be 
deposited into the member's DROP account. Participants will elect when such distribution 
of the balance in their DROP accounts shall take place. Elections for distributions shall be 
made to the board of trustees in writing in such manner and form acceptable to the board. 
Notwithstanding, any payments to a member must comply with the minimum distribution 
requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9), and are subject to the requirements of section 38-65(2), 
e.g. payments must commence by age seventy and one-half (70½). 
2. ?Within thirty (30) days after the end of any calendar quarter following the termination of a 
member's employment, the balance in the member's DROP account may be payable at the 
member's option as follows: 
3. ?In full in a single lump sum payment, plus interest, less withholding taxes remitted to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to include Section 457 (deferred income) accounts; or 
4. ?In an eligible rollover distribution to a qualified or Individual Retirement Account (IRA) as 
provided in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC); or 
5. ?In a combination partial lump sum payment and rollover as described above. 
Regardless of the option selected by the member, the board has the right to accelerate 
payments in order to comply with Section 401(A)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the 
right to defer payments to comply with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
k. ?Death. If a DROP participant dies before the account balance is paid out in full, the DROP 
participant's designated beneficiary shall have the same rights as the participant to elect and 
receive the payout options set forth in paragraph (i) above. DROP payments to a beneficiary 
shall be in addition to any retirement benefits payable to the member. Members who are or 
have been DROP participants are not eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits. 
l. ?Forms. The forms and notices shall be approved for use in administering the DROP by the 
board. 
(6) ?COLA. Commencing January 1, 2004, and each January thereafter, the benefits payable to 
members, beneficiaries, and survivors pursuant to this section and section 38-57 and subsection 38-
59(2) shall be increased as follows: 
a. ?For members fifty-three (53) years of ageOne (1) percent. 
b. ?For members fifty-four (54) years of ageTwo (2) percent. 
c. ?For members fifty-five (55) years of age and olderThree (3) percent. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, benefits for members fifty-five (55) years of age and 
older based on credited service earned on and after the effective date of this ordinance shall be 
increased by one and one-half (1.5) percent commencing January 1, 2013, and each January 
thereafter. Provided, the benefit adjustment provided in the preceding sentence shall not apply 
to members who were employed on the effective date of this ordinance and had reached age 
fifty-two (52) with ten (10) or more years of credited service or twenty-five (25) years of credited 
service on that date; such members and their beneficiaries and survivors shall continue to 
receive a three (3) percent annual cost-of-living adjustment. 
Increases to beneficiaries and survivors shall be based upon the age the member would have 
attained if the member had survived. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 8-2004, §§ 24, 4-15-04; Ord. No. 23, 2012, § 4, 9-13-
12; Ord. No. 2, 2013, § 3, 5-2-13) 


Sec. 38-57. - Pre-retirement death. 
(1) ?Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not 
receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet partially or fully vested or eligible for early or normal 
retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated 
contributions. 
(2) ?Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement. The beneficiary of any member who dies and 
who, at the date of his death was partially or fully vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, 
shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a. ?If the member was partially or fully vested, but had not attained at least age fifty (50), the 
beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the 
deceased member would have attained age fifty-two (52) for a normal retirement benefit or age 
fifty (50) for an early retirement benefit, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be 
calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service, average 
final compensation and vested percentage as of the date of his death and reduced as for early 
retirement, if applicable. The beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, 
payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits 
prior to age fifty (50). 
b. ?If the deceased member was eligible for normal (age fifty-two (52)) or early (age fifty (50)) 
retirement, the beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the 
first day of the month following the member's death or at the date the member would have 
attained age fifty-two (52), at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for 
normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final 
compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
c. ?A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a 
lump sum payment pursuant to section 38-60, subsection (7). 
d. ?A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in a. or b. above, elect to receive a refund 
of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
e. ?In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified 
Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit 
accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed 
employment and then died while employed. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 20, 2010, § 4, 9-16-10) 


Sec. 38-58. - Disability. 
(1) ?Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to 
the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to 
render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the 
performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the 
board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 60 percent of the average final compensation of the 
member, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall not be less than two 
percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. Terminated persons, either 
vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city 
for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(2) ?In-line of duty presumptions. 
a. ?Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or 
heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is 
shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a 
physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any 
evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to 
benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
b. ?Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection b shall apply only to 
those conditions described in this subsection b that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1. ?Definitions. As used in this subsection (2)b., the following definitions apply: 
a. ?Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids 
to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-
borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For 
purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the

sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne 
organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
b. ?Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full time by

officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of 
occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and 
who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency 
rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public 
hospital licensed under Chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a 
subsidiary thereof. 
c. ?Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, 
or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
d. ?High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person 
subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated 
with his employment: 
i. ?Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is 
a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii. ?At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an

such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
e. ?Occupational exposure , in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or 
tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that 
may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2. ?Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or 
impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, 
that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall 
be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown 
by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member 
must, by written affidavit as provided in § 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written 
declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
a. ?In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i. ?Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have 
sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his 
employment; 
ii. ?Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising 
out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present 
employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation 
disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to 
indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii. ?Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by 
the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or 
had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe 
sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv. ?Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
b. ?In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the 10 days immediately preceding 
diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person 
known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of 
the disease. 
c. ?In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative 
tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, 
to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3. ?Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of 
immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which 
a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given 
circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or 
public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or 
prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or 
other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written 
declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo 
such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the 
presumption. 
4. ?Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably 
suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the 
disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such 
exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident 
report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to 
hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5. ?Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption 
provided by this section: 
a. ?An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have 
undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable 
disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions 
derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This 
paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
b. ?On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be 
required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to 
reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3) ?Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall 
become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically 
determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, 
which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon 
establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 2.5 
percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any 
event, the maximum amount paid to the member shall be 50 percent of his average final 
compensation, but not less than two percent of average final compensation for each year of credited 
service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, 
except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days 
after termination. 
(4) ?Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall 
establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a. ?Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
b. ?Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil 
insurrections or while committing a crime. 
c. ?Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
d. ?Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the City of Palm Beach 
Gardens shall have terminated. 
(5) ?Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until 
and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or 
surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select 
the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the 
board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this division may be periodically re-
examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the 
board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer 
permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a 
firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a 
firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed 
upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 
days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree 
receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the 
board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel 
accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service 
will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he 
received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the 
city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability 
claims. 
(6) ?Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's 
disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines 
such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board 
determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the 
first payment. The last payment will be: 
a. ?If the retiree recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due 
next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
b. ?If the retiree dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal retirement date while 
still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, 
whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which 
benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 38-60, 
subsection (1)a. or (1)b., which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7) ?Workers; compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation 
benefits pursuant to Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, for the same disability, and the total monthly 
benefits received from both exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the member's average monthly 
wage, as defined in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so 
that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed one hundred percent (100%) 
of such wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to 
an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 
83.9692. This subsection (7) shall only be applicable to the extent it does not violate the minimum 
requirements of Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of forty-two 
percent (42%) of average final compensation or two percent (2%) of average final compensation 
times years of credited service. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 11-2000, § 5, 4-6-00) 


Sec. 38-59. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment with the city, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not 
eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1) ?If the member has less than five (5) years credited service upon termination, the member shall 
be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited 
with the fund. 
(2) ?If a member has five or more years of credited service, he will be entitled to a monthly 
retirement income to commence at age fifty-two (52), provided his accumulated contributions 
remain in the system. If the member so requests in writing, filed with the board, payment may 
commence on the first day of any month on or after the date on which the member attains age 
fifty (50). Such monthly retirement income payable to a member under the provisions of this 
subsection (2) shall be equal to the product of the member's vested percentage at the date of 
his termination of service as provided in subsection (3) and the accrued benefit which he has 
accrued to the date of his termination of service. If the monthly retirement income is to 
commence on or after the date on which the member attains age fifty (50), but prior to the 
attainment of age fifty-two (52), the benefit in this subsection shall be reduced as for early 
retirement. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not 
survive to age fifty (50), his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided 
herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under preretirement death. 
(3) ?Except as otherwise provided herein, each member not otherwise fully vested shall have a 
minimum vested interest in the amount of his accrued benefit equal to the percentage thereof, 
as hereinafter indicated, applicable to the number of his years of credited service:

Provided, however, a member who meets the early retirement provisions or the normal 
retirement provisions shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested regardless of the above 
schedule. 
Each member shall at all times and in all events have a fully vested interest in his accumulated 
contribution. No member's vested interest is to be reduced as a result of any amendment to this 
section; however, any increase in a member's vested interest will be determined by the vesting 
schedule in effect at the time of his separation from service. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98) 


Sec. 38-60. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1) ?In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early 
retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a 
retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the 
following options: 
a. ?A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
b. ?A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of 
the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five 
percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %), or fifty percent (50%) of such 
monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint 
pensioner is his spouse, the present value of payments to the retiree shall not be less than fifty 
percent (50%) of the total present value of payments to the retiree and his joint pensioner. A 
retired member may change his or her designated survivor up to two (2) times without the 
approval of the board or the current designated survivor. The retiree member need not provide 
proof of the good health of the designated survivor being removed, and the designated survivor 
being removed need not be living. The amount of the retirement income payable to the member 
upon the designation of a new designated survivor or joint pensioner shall be actuarially 
recalculated taking into account the age and sex of the former designated survivor or joint 
pensioner, the new designated survivor or joint pensioner, and the member, with the new 
benefit being actuarially equivalent to the original benefit. Each such designation shall be made 
in writing and filed with the board of trustees. Any costs associated with the actuarial calculation 
of the benefit shall be borne by the member. 
c. ?If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect 
to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be 
assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an 
extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The 
amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the 
social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
d. ?Partial lump sum distribution. 
(1) ?A member who retires on a normal retirement after attaining normal retirement eligibility as 
set forth in section 38-56 may elect a benefit of an equivalent actuarial value comprised of 
one partial lump sum payment and a reduced monthly income. The partial lump sum 
payment shall: 
a. ?Be in the amount selected by the retiring member but shall not exceed the product of 
multiplying the retiring member's normal amount and form of retirement income by the 
number of complete months of credited service, not to exceed sixty (60) months, 
earned after the attainment of normal retirement eligibility; 
b. ?Shall be payable at a time selected by the board, in its sole discretion, not less than 
sixty (60) nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the member's retirement 
date with no interest payable for the period between the member's retirement date 
and the payment of the partial lump sum; 
c. ?Be eligible for rollover distribution as provided in section 38-74; and 
d. ?Be paid to the retired member's designated beneficiary should the retired member die 
before payment of the partial lump sum. 
(2) ?The monthly retirement income of a member who selected this partial lump sum 
distribution option shall: 
a. ?Be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the normal form and amount of monthly 
retirement income after accounting for the partial lump sum distribution; 
b. ?Be further modified should the member elect one of the optional forms of benefits set 
forth in subsections (a), (b), and (c) above, which options shall be available to 
members selecting this partial lump sum distribution option. 
(3) ?This partial lump sum distribution option shall not be available to members retiring with a 
disability benefit, participating in the DROP, or receiving a vested termination benefit. The 
monthly retirement income after all modifications shall: 
a. ?Be the starting basis of the death benefit paid to the surviving beneficiary pursuant to 
section 38-57 or the survivor benefit pursuant to section 38-60 as selected by the 
retired member; and 
b. ?Be the starting basis for calculating the annual cost of living adjustments as provided 
herein. 
(2) ?The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection 
(1)b. above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system 
in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to 
time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where 
applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option 
with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, 
member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at anytime, but may only change his joint 
pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new 
joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. 
(3) ?The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not 
be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the 
system shall thereupon cease. 
(4) ?Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the 
retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the 
age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the 
benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the 
time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for 
a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with 
the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are 
payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as 
provided in section 38-61. 
(5) ?Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the 
provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
a. ?If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first 
occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if 
any, will be determined under section 38-57. 
b. ?If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's 
retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement 
income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if 
the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the 
provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his 
retirement. 
c. ?If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die 
before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period 
certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in 
its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum 
and in accordance with section 38-61. 
d. ?If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 
38-56, subsection (1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant 
to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, 
or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) 
designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired 
under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(6) ?A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first 
retirement check. 
(7) ?Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a 
lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the monthly benefit 
amount is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or the total commuted value of the remaining 
monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any such 
payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the 
preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with 
regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and 
conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 11-2000, § 6, 4-6-00; Ord. No. 8-2004, § 5, 4-15-04; 
Ord. No. 20, 2010, § 5, 9-16-10) 


Sec. 38-61. - Beneficiaries. 
(1) ?Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, 
designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the 
event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or Retiree by 
signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights 
of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2) ?If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection 
(1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceased the 
member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to 
such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, 
in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be 
paid in a lump sum. 
(3) ?Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of 
all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with 
rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and 
conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 11-2000, § 7, 4-6-00) 


Sec. 38-62. - Claims procedures. 
(1) ?The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written 
requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), 
including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2) ?The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's 
claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A 
reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth 
in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98) 


Sec. 38-63. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the division of 
retirement containing documents and information required by Section 175.261, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98; Ord. No. 11-2000, § 8, 4-6-00) 


Sec. 38-64. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions 
of this division in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall 
cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to 
show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 27-1998, 12-17-98) 


Sec. 38-65. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(1) ?Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the annual pension 
that is accrued by or paid to a member shall not exceed the dollar limitation set forth below. If the 
benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension 
in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the 
dollar limitation. 
a. ?Definitions used in this section: 
1. ?"Annual pension" means the benefits received by a member under this plan expressed in 
the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the 
dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life 
annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(A) ?The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under 
the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable 
to the member; or 
(B) ?The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity 
starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable 
to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption and the 
applicable mortality table described in Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting 
date. 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly 
related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental 
death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit 
of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to 
Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations 
of this subsection (1)a., and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation 
year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (1)a. applicable at the annuity starting 
date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the code. For this 
purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of 
benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
2. ?"Dollar limitation" means $160,000 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under 
Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the member 
when benefits begin as follows: 
(A) ?Except with respect to a member who is a "qualified participant" as defined in Section 
415(b)(2)(H) of the code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as 
defined in Section 415(b)(2)(l) of the code) beginning before age sixty-two (62), the 
age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
(i) ?The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity 
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present 
value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62), where 
annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62) 
are equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d) for the 
limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is 
computed using a five (5) percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table 
under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and 
expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the 
annuity starting date); and 
(ii) ?The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d)) multiplied by the 
ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual 
amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age sixty-two 
(62), with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of Section 
415. 
(B) ?For benefits beginning after the age of sixty-five (65), the age-adjusted dollar 
limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
(i) ?The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity 
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present 
value as a straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65), where annual 
payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65) are 
equal to the dollar limitation of Section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to 
Section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent 
straight life annuity is computed using a five (5) percent interest rate and the 
applicable mortality table under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that 
annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed 
calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
(ii) ?The Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section 
415(d) and Section 1.415(d)-1 for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the 
annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity 
under the plan to the adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity. The 
adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount 
of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the member, 
computed disregarding the member's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but 
including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to 
offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately 
commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of 
Section 415. The adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity means the 
annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to 
a hypothetical member who is sixty-five (65) years old and has the same accrued 
benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age sixty-five (65)) 
as the member receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the member's 
accruals after age sixty-five (65) and without applying the rules of Section 415). 
(C) ?There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits 
beginning between the ages of sixty-two (62) and sixty-five (65). 
b. ?The limitations set forth in subsection (1) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed 
$10,000 provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained 
by the city. 
c. ?Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual 
increases determined by the secretary of the treasury under Section 415(d) of the code. 
d. ?In the case of a member who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the plan, the dollar 
limitation set forth in subsection a.2. of this subsection (1) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) 
the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and 
(ii) the denominator of which is ten (10). 
e. ?Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions 
(unless picked up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner 
prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the code. 
f. ?Should any member participate in more than one (1) defined benefit plan maintained by the city, 
in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as 
of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the 
member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will 
equal the dollar limitation. 
g. ?For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one (1) annuity 
starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and 
shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past 
and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this 
purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without 
regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and 
(C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
h. ?The determination of the annual pension under subsection a.1. of this subsection (1) shall take 
into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the code) social 
security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits 
transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits 
pursuant to Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
i. ?The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the code, as 
amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to 
the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the code and regulations thereunder. If 
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (1) and the provisions of 
Section 415 of the code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such 
a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the code. The value of any 
benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (1) shall be used to decrease 
future employer contributions. 
(2) ?Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a member's 
retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the member's required beginning 
date, which is defined as the later of: 
- ?April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the member attains or will 
attain the age of seventy and one-half (70½) years; or 
- ?April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the member retires. 
(3) ?Required minimum distributions. 
a. ?Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be 
distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date as defined in 
subsection (2) of this section 38-65. 
b. ?Death of member before distributions begin. 
1. ?If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be 
distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(A) ?If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then 
distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year 
immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 
31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and 
one-half (70½), if later. 
(B) ?If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, 
then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the 
calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
(C) ?If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the 
year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by 
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's 
death. 
2. ?The member's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(A) ?Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date 
distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the 
member's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described 
in subsection b.1. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period 
certain not exceeding: 
(i) ?Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the 
life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's 
age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the 
calendar year of the member's death; or 
(ii) ?If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life 
expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age 
as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity 
starting date. 
(B) ?No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date distributions begin and 
there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of 
the member's death, distribution of the member's entire interest will be completed by 
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's 
death. 
3. ?Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in 
which (i) the member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the 
member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the 
surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subsections b.1. 
and b.2. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the member. 
c. ?Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during the member's lifetime. 
1. ?Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the member's spouse. If the member's 
interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of 
the member and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the 
member's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death 
must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such 
period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of 
Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a 
joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a nonspousal beneficiary 
and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to 
annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the 
period certain. 
2. ?Period certain annuities. Unless the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary 
and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an 
annuity distribution commencing during the member's lifetime may not exceed the 
applicable distribution period for the member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in 
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the 
annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the member 
reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the member is the 
distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in 
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the 
age of the member as of the member's birthday in the year that contains the annuity 
starting date. If the member's spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the 
form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not 
exceed the longer of the member's applicable distribution period, as determined under this 
subsection c.2., or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the 
member's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in 
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations, using the member's and spouse's 
attained ages as of the member's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains 
the annuity starting date. 
d. ?Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity 
purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning 
date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with 
subsections 1., 2. and 3. below. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity 
purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance 
with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of 
the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) 
of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of 
the code and the treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
1. ?General annuity requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity 
distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following 
requirements: 
(A) ?The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not 
longer than one (1) year; 
(B) ?The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer 
than the distribution period described in subsections b. or c. above, whichever is 
applicable, of this subsection (3); 
(C) ?Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be 
changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(D) ?Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(i) ?By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage 
increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(ii) ?To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the member's payments to 
provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life 
was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the 
member's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the 
meaning of Section 414(p) of the code; 
(iii) ?To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the member's death; or 
(iv) ?To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
2. ?Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be 
distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies 
before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection 
b.1.(A) or b.1.(B), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one (1) 
payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next 
payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment 
intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-
annually, or annually. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first 
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity 
payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
3. ?Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to 
the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed 
beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following 
the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
e. ?Date distributions commence. For purposes of this subsection (3), distributions are considered 
to begin on the member's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence 
to the member (or to the member's surviving spouse) before the member's required beginning 
date (or, if to the member's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin 
in accordance with subsection b.1. above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the 
date distributions actually commence. 
f. ?Definitions. 
1. ?Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan 
and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the code and Section 
1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the treasury regulations. 
2. ?Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. 
For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is 
the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's 
required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first 
distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin 
pursuant to subsection b. of this subsection (3). 
3. ?Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations. 
(4) ?a. ?Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a 
distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner 
prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid 
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
b. ?Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
1. ?Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any 
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover 
distribution does not include: 
(A) ?Any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments 
(not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the 
distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the 
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; 
(B) ?Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of 
the code; 
(C) ?The portion of any distribution that is a hardship distribution described in Section 
401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the code; and 
(D) ?The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined 
without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to 
employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an 
eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee 
contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be 
transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 
408(a) or (b) of the code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in 
Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so 
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which 
is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so 
includible. 
c. ?Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described 
in Section 408(a) of the code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the 
code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the code, an annuity contract described in 
Section 403(b) of the code, a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the code, an eligible 
plan under Section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a 
state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which 
agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with 
respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of 
Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
d. ?Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's 
or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or 
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined 
in Section 414(p) of the code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former 
spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined 
in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct 
rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the code or an 
individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the code shall be considered a 
distributee. 
e. ?Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified 
by the distributee. 
(5) ?Maximum amount of mandatory distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the 
maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the code, 
payable under the plan shall be $1,000. 
(6) ?Compensation limitations under Section 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set 
forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual 
compensation of each member taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA 
annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA 
annual compensation limit is $200,000, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of 
living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for 
a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which compensation 
is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period 
consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied 
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the 
denominator of which is twelve (12). 
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the code shall mean the EGTRRA 
annual compensation limit set forth in this provision.

individual member share accounts in an amount directly proportionate to the salary 
which the member was paid compared to the total fire department payroll (as 
determined under F.S. § 175.122) in the calendar year preceding the date for which 
F.S. Chapter 175, tax revenues were received. In addition, any amount of money 
described in subsection (2)a. above attributable to the previous calendar year and not 
otherwise distributed pursuant to the previous sentence, shall be allocated to each 
individual member account in an amount directly proportionate to the number of pay 
periods for which the member was paid compared to the total number of pay periods 
for which all members were paid, counting the pay periods in the calendar year 
preceding the date for which the F.S. Chapter 175, tax revenues were received. 
2. ?Effective October 1, 2000 (only as to funds received on or after the effective date of

deduction of the two percent total compensation which commences in FY 2004, shall 
be allocated as provided for in this paragraph 2. All monies received from Chapter 
175, Florida Statutes, premium tax rebates, including any supplemental payments,

(ii) ?The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to 
each share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a 
fraction of the total amount with the individual share allotment for the year as the 
numerator of the fraction and the sum of the total share allotments for the year as 
the denominator of the fraction. 
b. ?Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual share 
account shall be adjusted to reflect the earnings or losses resulting from investment during 
the year. The investment earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share 
accounts shall be in the same percentage as are earned or lost by the total investment 
earnings or losses of the fund as a whole, unless the board dedicates a separate 
investment portfolio for the Chapter 175 Florida Statutes share accounts, in which case the 
investment earnings or losses shall be measured by the investment earnings or losses of 
the separate investment portfolio. 
c. ?Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual share 
account shall be adjusted to allocate the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the 
fund. Costs, fees, and expenses of administration shall be allocated to each individual 
member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of 
administration of the fund as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment 
gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole. 
d. ?No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share 
account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets 
of the trust or in the Chapter 175 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, 
and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
e. ?Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as 
of the end of the plan year. 
(4) ?Forfeitures. Any member who has less than five (5) years of service credit and who is not 
otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as 
provided for in subsection (5) shall forfeit his individual member share account or the non-
vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual member 
accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection (3)a.2. 
(5) ?Eligibility for benefits. Any member who terminates employment as a firefighter with the city, 
upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual 
member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
a. ?Retirement benefit. 
1. ?A member shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share 
account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to section 38-56. 
2. ?Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
b. ?Termination benefit. 
1. ?In the event that a member's employment as a firefighter is terminated by reason 
other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive an amount 
equal to the vested portion of his share account balance. The vested portion shall be 
determined in accordance with the schedule in section 38-59, subsection (3). 
2. ?Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
c. ?Disability benefit. 
1. ?In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty 
disability benefit pursuant to section 38-58, subsection (1) or a not-in-line of duty 
disability benefit pursuant to section 38-58, subsection (3), he shall be entitled to one 
hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
2. ?Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
d. ?Death benefit. 
1. ?In the event that a member dies while actively employed as a firefighter, one hundred 
(100) percent of the value of his share account shall be paid to his designated 
beneficiary as provided in section 38-61. 
(6) ?Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment and is otherwise entitled to receive all or a 
portion of the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued 
on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of 
employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance or the vested portion thereof are 
payable not later than thirty (30) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one (1) lump 
sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. Participants shall elect when such 
distribution of the balance in their share accounts will take place. Elections for distributions shall be 
made to the board of trustees in writing in such a manner and form acceptable to the board. 
Notwithstanding, any payments to a member must comply with the minimum distribution 
requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9), and are subject to the requirements of section 38-65(2), e.g. 
payments must commence by age seventy and one-half (70½). All share account monies not paid 
out shall continue to be adjusted to reflect earnings and losses accordingly as provided for in section 
38-78(3)(b). 
(7) ?Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section 38-78 shall be paid only from the 
assets allocated to individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any 
duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account 
benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any 
investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the share 
account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All 
investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund 
investments.

Case Law reference A municipality may enact an ordinance which creates an offense against 
municipal law for the same act that constitutes an offense against state law. Jaramillo v. City of 
Homestead , 322 So. 2d 496 (Fla. 1975). 
A municipality by ordinance may adopt state misdemeanor statutes by specific reference or by 
general reference, such as that contained in an ordinance making it unlawful to commit, within 
city limits, any act which is or shall be recognized by the laws of the state as a misdemeanor. Id. 
An adoption by general reference of a misdemeanor statute permits subsequent amendments, 
revisions and repeals of the laws by the state legislature to apply to the municipal ordinances. Id.

reside with the tenant are prohibited from establishing residence pursuant to this article. If the 
landlord receives an affidavit from the tenant that no person residing within the tenancy is registered 
or is required to register and the landlord checks the registration list based on the identities of the 
tenants and/or residents proposed to be occupying the tenancy to confirm the persons are not on the 
list, receipt of such an affidavit and such efforts of confirmation shall demonstrate that a landlord has 
exercised good faith in ascertaining whether he/she/it was renting to a sexual predator or sexual 
offender, even if it is ultimately determined that a sexual predator or sexual offender does or did 
reside in the subject tenancy.

the area of the offender's or predator's residence within the city boundaries, the restrictions of this chapter

fide contract rights; provided, however, that the provisions of this article shall apply upon termination of 
any leasehold relationship arising from a landlord tenant relationship or the expiration of a lease. When a 
person who is the subject of this article changes residences, this article shall fully apply to such persons.

to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve (12) 
months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article 
shall be prosecuted in the same manner as misdemeanors are prosecuted. Additionally, if the offender is 
supervised by the department of corrections under conditional release, the offender may be charged with

Sec. 50-61. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Aggregate number of years of service means the total number of years, and fractional parts of years, 
of service of any police officer, omitting intervening years and fractional parts of years, when such police 
officer may not be employed by the municipality. However, no police officer will receive credit for years or 
fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his contributions to the fund for those years 
or fractional parts of years. A police officer may voluntarily leave his contributions in the fund for a period 
of five years after leaving the employ of the police department, pending the possibility of his being rehired 
by the same department, without losing credit for the time he has participated actively as a police officer. 
Should he not be reemployed as a police officer, with the same department, within five years, his 
contribution shall be returned to him without interest. 
    Average monthly earnings means a police officer's monthly salary or wage paid or accrued as

Beach Gardens Police Officers' Pension Fund upon the death of a member or participant. 
    Credited service means the number of full years (and fraction thereof) of continuous service from

the event of: 
(1) ?Absence on an approved leave of absence. A police officer on an approved leave of absence 
shall not receive credited service but shall retain all credited service previously accrued. Upon 
returning to work, the police officer will again accrue credited service. 
(2) ?Absence from work because of occupational injury or disease incurred in employment for which 
a police officer is entitled to Workers' Compensation payments. A police officer on an approved 
leave of absence as a result of occupational injury or disease shall continue to accrue credited 
service and shall retain all credited service previously accrued. 
(3) ?Absence due to service in the armed forces of the United States, provided the officer shall 
reenter employment with the city within one year of discharge. A police officer shall not receive 
credited service while absent due to military service but shall retain all credited service 
previously accrued. Upon returning to work, the police officer will again accrue credited service 
and will be credited with service for time spent on active duty for up to five years if: 
a. ?The police officer is in the active employ of the municipality prior to such service and leaves 
a position, other than a temporary position, for the purpose of voluntary or involuntary 
service in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
b. ?The police officer is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of the Uniformed 
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. Effective January 1, 2007, members 
who die or become disabled while on active duty military service, during a break in the 
member's employment, shall be entitled to the rights of this section even though such 
member was not re-employed by the city. Members who die or become disabled while on 
active duty military service shall be treated as though they were re-employed the day 
before the member became disabled or died, was credited with the service they would 
have been entitled to under this section, and then either died a non-duty related death 
while employed or became disabled from a non-duty related disability. 
    Fund or police officers' pension fund means the Palm Beach Gardens Police Officers' Pension Fund. 
    Group annuity contract means a contract issued by an insurance company providing for the payment 
of retirement benefits to police officers who become entitled to such benefits in accordance with the 
provisions of this fund. 
    Insurance company means a legal reserve life insurance company organized or incorporated under 
the laws of any state of the United States of America and duly licensed in the state. 
    Police officer means any person who is elected, appointed, or employed full-time by any municipality, 
who is certified or required to be certified as a law enforcement officer in compliance with state law, who 
is vested with the authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the 
prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, criminal, traffic, or highway laws of the 
state. This definition includes all certified supervisory and command personnel whose duties include, in 
whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time law 
enforcement officers, part-time law enforcement officers, or auxiliary law enforcement officers, but does 
not include part-time law enforcement officers or auxiliary law enforcement officers as the same are 
defined in Sections 943.10(6) and (8), [Florida Statutes], respectively. 
    Retirement or retired means a police officer's withdrawal from city employment with a pension 
payable from the fund. 
    Retiree means a person who has entered into retirement from the city. 
    Salary means the average monthly earnings reported to the Internal Revenue Service for income tax

differential wages to members who are absent from employment while in qualified military service. 
Notwithstanding the preceding two (2) sentences, effective September 13, 2012, salary will henceforth 
mean base pay, excluding all other compensation; provided that the salary of any member employed on 
September 13, 2012, shall include payment for unused accrued sick and annual leave up to the dollar 
amount of unused sick and annual leave that the member has accrued as of September 13, 2012. 
However, in no event, will the salary of any member who is employed on September 13, 2012, be less 
than the member's salary on September 12, 2012, as determined in accordance with the definition of 
salary in effect on September 12, 2012.

power and authority to employ counseling or investment management services. The aim of the

principal, and to secure the maximum total return on investments that is consonant with safety 
of principal, provided that such investments and re-investments shall be limited only by the 
investments permitted by the investment policy guidelines adopted by the board in accordance 
with Florida law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, investments in foreign investments are limited 
in accordance with F.S. § 185.06(1)(b)4. The board members must discharge these duties with 
respect to the plan solely in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries and (i) for the 
exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying 
reasonable expenses of administering the plan; (ii) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence 
under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and

like aims; and (iii) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large 
losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.

scrutinized company, as defined in that section. Beginning January 1, 2010, the board must 
proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly-traded securities it may have directly in 
that company. The divestiture of any such security must be completed by September 10, 2010. 
The board and its named officers or investment advisors may not be deemed to have breached 
their fiduciary duty in any action taken to dispose of any such security, and the board shall have 
satisfactorily discharged the fiduciary duties of loyalty, prudence, and sole and exclusive benefit 
to the participants of the pension fund and their beneficiaries if the actions it takes are 
consistent with the duties imposed by F.S. § 215.473, as provided for in F.S. § 185.06(7), and 
the manner of the disposition, if any, is reasonable as to the means chosen. For purposes of

may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the board of trustees or any 
employee, officer, director, or advisor of such pension fund based upon the divestiture of any 
security pursuant to this subsection.

(2) ?The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether 
distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust

benefits under the plan, as set forth herein below in subsection (3). 
(3) ?The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the

retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, 
except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase 
of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single 
premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the 
employee's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the 
value of any plan benefits previously paid to the employee. 
(4) ?If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after 
payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the 
city, less any state contributions returned to the state, provided that, if the excess is less than 
the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such 
excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5) ?The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with the manner of distribution determined 
under subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3).

be payable in the event of death; and each designation may be revoked by such police officer by 
signing and filing with the board of trustees a new designation of beneficiary form. 
(b) ?If a deceased police officer failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed above in 
subsection (a) of this section, or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by the deceased police

(3) ?The deceased police officer's estate; or 
(4) ?The trustees in their sole discretion, may apportion the remaining benefit among any two or 
more of subsections (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection. 
(c) ?If there is no designated beneficiary or the designated beneficiary dies prior to receiving the full 
benefit, the remaining amount of benefit shall be paid in a single lump sum.

all obligations of the fund under the plan and shall not be subject to review but shall be final, binding 
and conclusive on all persons ever interested thereunder.

income benefits have commenced, he or she may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner 
or beneficiary no more than two times in accordance with Section 185.341, Florida Statutes, without 
the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not 
required to provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and 
the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any retired member who desires 
to change his or her joint annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the board of trustees a notarized 
notice of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other 
notice, the board of trustees shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial 
tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the 
present value of the member's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. Any costs 
associated with the actuarial calculation of the benefit shall be borne by the member.

creditable service regardless of age. In the case of a retirement with twenty-five (25) years of 
service, Normal Retirement Age is the age a member has attained when retired at twenty-five (25) 
years of service. 
(b) ?Benefit. The monthly amount of normal retirement benefit payable to a police officer who retires on 
the normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to three and one-half (3.5) percent multiplied by 
the number of years of credited service, up to a maximum of one hundred (100) percent, multiplied 
by average monthly earnings. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for police officers who are 
employed and have not attained the normal retirement date prior to September 13, 2012, the 
monthly amount of normal retirement benefit payable to a police officer who retires on or after the 
normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to three and one-half (3.5) percent multiplied by the 
number of years of credited service prior to September 13, 2012, plus two and seventy-five one 
hundredths (2.75) percent multiplied by the number of years of credited service on and after 
September 13, 2012, up to a maximum of seventy-five (75) percent, multiplied by the police officer's 
average monthly earnings; and for police officers hired on or after September 13, 2012, the monthly 
amount of normal retirement benefit payable to a police officer who retires on or after the normal 
retirement date shall be an amount equal to two and seventy-five one hundredths (2.75) percent 
multiplied by the number of years of credited service on and after September 13, 2012, up to a 
maximum of seventy-five (75) percent, multiplied by the police officer's average monthly earnings. In 
no event will the benefit paid be less than two (2) percent per year of service. 
(c) ?Payment. A retired police officer's retirement benefit normally shall be payable in the form of a 
monthly life annuity with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed. This form of 
annuity provides for a retirement benefit payable monthly to the retired employee during their 
lifetimes with a guarantee that not less than one hundred twenty (120) monthly retirement benefits 
shall be paid, even if the retired employee dies prior to the receipt of one hundred twenty (120) 
payments.

may elect to terminate employment and retire on an early retirement date which may be the first day 
of any month after ten years of service and attainment of age 50. 
(b) ?Benefit. The monthly amount of early retirement benefits payable to a police officer who retires on 
the early retirement date shall be determined based on credited service to the early retirement date 
reduced by three percent for each year by which the member's age at retirement preceded the 
member's normal retirement age to take into account the police officer's younger age and the earlier 
commencement of retirement income payments. 
    If the period between the early retirement date and normal retirement date is not an integral number 
of years, the percentage to be applied shall be the percentage for the next higher integral number of 
years, increased by a proportionate part of the difference between that percentage and the percentage for 
the next lower integral number of years.

Sec. 50-118. - Disability retirement. 
(a) ?Line of duty disability. A police officer may retire from the service of the city under the plan, if prior to 
normal retirement date, the officer becomes totally and permanently disabled in the line of duty by 
reason of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (d) of this section, on or after the 
effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall herein be referred to as duty disability retirement. 
(b) ?Nonline of duty disability. 
(1) ?A police officer must have ten years of credited service in order to receive nonservice disability 
benefits. The officer must be totally and permanently disabled as defined below. 
(2) ?The provisions for nonline of duty disability shall not apply to a member who has reached or 
passed normal retirement age. 
(c) ?Determination of disability. For purposes of this plan, a disability shall mean permanent and total 
disability as determined by the board of trustees in accordance with the following standards: 
(1) ?A police officer shall be deemed permanently and totally disabled only if he has been disabled 
by physical or mental injury or disease so as to be unable to perform as a police officer and if 
such disability shall have continued for six consecutive months. If the officer is ineligible to 
receive disability benefits under Title II of the Federal Social Security Act on account of a 
nonduty disability, the benefits payable shall be capped at 50 percent of the officers final 
average monthly earnings. 
(2) ?The board of trustees shall have the right to require the employee to submit to a physical 
examination at intervals determined by the board. 
(3) ?Any condition or impairment of health of a police officer caused by tuberculosis, hypertension, 
heart disease, hardening of the arteries, hepatitis or meningococcal meningitis resulting in a 
total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to be accidental and suffered in the line of 
duty, unless the contrary can be shown by competent evidence. Any condition or impairment of 
health caused directly or proximately by exposure, which exposure occurred in the active 
performance of duty at some definite time or place without willful negligence on the part of the 
police officer, resulting in total or partial disability, shall be presumed to be accidental and 
suffered in the line of duty, provided that such police officer shall have successfully passed a 
physical examination upon entering such service, which physical examination, including 
electrocardiogram, failed to reveal any evidence of such condition. In order to be entitled to the 
presumption in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the police officer 
must meet the requirements of F.S. ch. 112.181. The final decision whether a police officer 
meets the requirements for duty disability pension rests with the board of trustees and shall be 
based on substantial competent evidence on the record as a whole. 
(d) ?Exclusions. A police officer shall not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the 
disability is the result of: 
(1) ?Excessive and habitual use by the police officer of drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics; 
(2) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while willfully and illegally participating in fights, 
riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(3) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while serving in any armed forces. This 
exclusion does not affect members who have become disabled as a result of intervening military 
service under the federal Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 (H.R. 6081; 
P.L. 110-245); 
(4) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer after employment has been terminated; or 
(5) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while working for anyone other than the city 
and arising out of such other employment. 
(e) ?Medical review. No police officer shall be permitted to retire under a disability retirement until 
examined by a duly qualified physician or surgeon to be selected by the board of trustees for that 
purpose and found to be disabled in the degree and manner specified herein. Any police officer 
receiving a disability retirement shall be examined periodically by a duly qualified physician or 
surgeon or board of physicians and surgeons to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose 
to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. 
(f) ?Disability benefit. 
(1) ?Generally. For disability incurred during the line of duty, the disability benefit shall be 60 
percent of the police officers' rate of pay at the time of disability or the accrued pension benefit, 
whichever is greater for. For non-duty disability, the disability benefit shall consist of 2.5 percent 
multiplied by the average monthly earnings multiplied by the years of credited service, with the 
minimum benefit of 25 percent of salary or the accrued pension benefit, whichever is greater. In 
no event should the single sum value of such benefits as of the date of termination of service 
because of disability exceed: 
a. ?One hundred times the estimated normal monthly retirement income, based on the 
assumption that the present rate of compensation continues without changes to normal 
retirement date, 
b. ?Twice the annual rate of compensation as of the date of termination of service, or 
c. ?The single-sum value of the accrued deferred retirement income (beginning at normal 
retirement date) at date of termination of service, whichever is greatest. 
(2) ?Offset. A member who is receiving a disability benefit from the city and who is receiving 
benefits for the same disability under Social Security or worker's compensation, or who is 
receiving another retirement benefit from another plan of the city, shall have a deduction made 
from the monthly disability pension payment in an amount necessary to bring the total of all 
disability payments to no more than 100 percent of the average monthly earnings of the 
disabled person as of the time the disability retirement occurred. 
(g) ?Payment procedures. The monthly retirement income to which a police officer is entitled for disability 
retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines 
such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board 
determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the 
first payment. The last payment will be, if the police officer recovers from the disability prior to his 
normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or if the police 
officer dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding death or the 120th 
monthly payment, whichever is later. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of 
a disabled police officer shall be paid to the police officer's designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries).

Sec. 50-119. - Death benefits. 
(a) ?Line of duty death. If a member dies and the board finds that the death is the natural and proximate 
result of a personal injury or disease arising out of and in the course of his or her actual performance 
of duties as a police officer in the employ of the city, the following pension shall be paid: 
(1) ?The surviving spouse shall receive a pension equal to 50 percent of the members final average 
monthly earnings, or the accrued benefit without early retirement reduction, which ever is 
greater. This benefit shall continue until the death of the surviving spouse. 
(2) ?If the deceased member does not leave a surviving spouse, or if the surviving spouse dies, and 
the member leaves an unmarried child or children under age 18, or age 24 if a full-time student, 
each child shall receive equal shares of the surviving spouse pension calculated in paragraph 
(1). Upon any child's adoption, marriage, death or reaching age 18, or 24 if a full time student, 
the child's pension shall terminate and the monthly pension shall be reapportioned to the 
member's remaining eligible children under age 18, or 24 if a full time student. Any pension 
payable under this subsection shall be paid to the child's legal guardian. 
(3) ?If the deceased member does not leave a surviving spouse, child, or children eligible to receive 
a pension, then the death benefit shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. 
(4) ?In any of the cases mentioned in subsections (a)(1) through (3) of this subsection, the board 
may, in its sole discretion, direct that the actuarial value of the monthly payment be paid as a 
lump sum. 
(b) ?Nonduty death. For any deceased who was actively employed and eligible for normal or delayed 
retirement as of his date of death, the benefit payable shall be that monthly amount which would 
have been payable had the deceased employee retired on the date of death, with the resulting 
benefit being paid to the beneficiary for life. If a police officer dies prior to retirement, but has at least 
five years of contributing service, the beneficiaries are entitled to the benefits otherwise payable to 
the police officer at early or normal retirement age, whichever is applicable. If the police officer dies 
before being eligible to retire under the provisions of this plan, the heirs, legatees, beneficiaries, or 
personal representatives of such deceased police officer shall be entitled to a refund of 100 percent 
of the contribution, without interest, made to the fund by such deceased police officer.

accrued to the date of termination, payable for ten (10) years certain and life thereafter, commencing 
at early or normal retirement date, provided he has ten (10) or more years of credit service. Early 
retirement benefit will be actuarially reduced in accordance with this section.

Sec. 50-121. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a) ?Each member entitled to a normal, disability, or early retirement benefit shall have the right at any 
time prior to the date on which the benefit begins to elect to have the benefit payable under any of 
the options hereinafter set forth in lieu of the benefits provided above, and to revoke any such 
elections and make a new election at any time prior to the actual commencement of payment. A 
police officer may not make any change in retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing 
the first retirement check. 
(b) ?The value of optional benefits shall be the actuarial equivalent of the value of benefits otherwise 
payable, and the present value of payments to the retiring member must be at least equal to 50 
percent of the total present value of payments to the retiring member and his beneficiary. The 
member shall make an election by written request to the board, such request being retained in the 
board's files. The options available to the members of the fund are as follows: 
(1) ?Contingent annuitant (joint and survivor option). The member may elect to receive a benefit 
during his lifetime and have such a benefit (100 percent or 75 percent or 66 2/3 percent or 50 
percent of such monthly benefit) continued after his death to and during the lifetime of his 
spouse or relative other than his spouse. The election of option 1 shall be null and void if the 
designated beneficiary dies before the member's payments commence. If a member has 
elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits 
have commenced, he or she may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner or 
beneficiary up to twice in accordance with F.S. § 185.341, without the approval of the board of 
trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof 
of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or 
beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any retired member who desires to change his or 
her joint annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the board of trustees a notarized notice of such 
change. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the 
board of trustees shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables 
and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the 
present value of the member's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. Any costs 
associated with the actuarial calculation of the benefit shall be borne by the member. 
(2) ?Life annuity. The member may elect to receive a benefit payable for the police officer's life only. 
(3) ?Other. In lieu of the other optional forms enumerated in this section, benefits may be paid in 
any form approved by the board so long as it is the actuarial equivalent of the benefits otherwise 
payable.

Sec. 50-123. - Incompetence. 
    If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the board of trustees, otherwise 
incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due them from the fund, the 
board may, unless and until claims have been made by a duly appointed guardian or committee of such 
person, make such payment or any part thereof to such person's spouse, children, parent or other person 
deemed by the board to have incurred expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such 
person. Any payments so made shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the system for such 
payment. 
(Code 1987, § 33.38(M)) 


Sec. 50-124. - Rights and benefits not subject to legal process. 
    The rights and benefits provided for in this article are vested rights of participants in the fund and 
shall not be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or any other legal process. However, the 
board shall honor an income deduction order for alimony or child support in accordance with rules and 
procedures adopted by the board. 
    Upon written request by the retiree, the board of trustees may authorize the plan administrator to 
withhold from the monthly retirement payment funds necessary to: 
(a) ?Pay for benefits being received through the city; 
(b) ?Pay the certified bargaining agent; or 
(c) ?Pay for premiums for accident health and long-term care insurance for the retiree, retiree's 
spouse, and dependents. A retirement plan does not incur liability for participation in this 
permissive program if its actions are taken in good faith pursuant to F.S. § 185.05(6).

which accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years 
that a police officer served as a police officer with any other municipal, county, state or federal law 
enforcement agency shall be added to the years of credited service provided that: 
(a) ?The police officer contributes to the fund the sum that would have been contributed, based on 
the police officer's salary and the employee contribution rate in effect at the time that the 
credited service is requested, had the police officer been a member of this system for the years 
or fractional parts of years for which the credit is requested plus amount actuarially determined 
such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs 
for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of 
credited service. 
(b) ?Payment by the police officer of the required amount may be made within six months of the 
request for credit and in one lump sum payment, or the police officer can buy back this time 
over a period equal to the length of time being purchased or five years, whichever is greater, at 
an interest rate which is equal to the fund's actuarial assumption. A police officer may request to 
purchase some or all years of service. No credit shall be given for any service until all years of 
service which are to be repurchased, have been repurchased. 
(c) ?The credit purchased under this section shall count for all purposes, except vesting. 
(d) ?In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior 
service with any other municipal, county, or state police department, if such prior service forms 
or will form a basis of a retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan.

Sec. 50-130. - Rollover distributions. 
(a) ?Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the 
meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different 
meaning: 
    Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the 
distributee. 
    Distributee means and includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or 
former employee's surviving spouse and employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who 
is entitled to payment for alimony and child support under a domestic relations order determined to be 
qualified by this fund are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. 
    Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the 
United States Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the 
United States Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the United States 
Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the United States Internal 
Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an 
eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement 
account or individual retirement annuity. 
    Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of 
the distributee, except that an eligible rollover does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of 
substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life 
expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the 
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the 
extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the United States Internal Revenue Code; 
and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
(b) ?Application. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding 
any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this 
section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to 
have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified 
by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(Ord. No. 3-1996, § 6, 4-18-96) 


Sec. 50-131. - Internal Revenue Code limits. 
(a) ?In no event may a member's annual benefit exceed $120,000.00 (adjusted for cost of living in 
accordance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 415(d), but only for the year in which such 
adjustment is effective). 
(b) ?If a member has less than ten years of service with the city, the applicable limitation in subsection 
(a) of this section shall be reduced by multiplying such limitation by a fraction, not to exceed one. 
The numerator of such fraction shall be the number of years, or part thereof, of service with the city; 
the denominator shall be ten years. 
(c) ?For purposes of this section, "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a 
straight life annuity with no ancillary or incidental benefits and with no member or rollover 
contributions. To the extent that ancillary benefits are provided, the limits set forth in subsection (a) 
will be reduced actuarially, using an interest rate assumption equal to the greater of five percent or 
the rate being used for actuarial equivalence, to reflect such ancillary benefits. 
(d) ?If the distribution of retirement benefits begins before age 62, the dollar limitation as described in 
subsection (a) shall be reduced using an interest rate assumption equal to the greater of five percent 
or the interest rate used for actuarial equivalence; however, retirement benefits shall not be reduced 
below $75,000.00 if payment of benefits begins at or after age 55 and not below the actuarial 
equivalent of $75,000.00 if payment of benefits begins before age 55. For a member with 15 or more 
years of service with the city, the reductions described above shall not reduce such member's benefit 
below $50,000.00 (adjusted for cost of living in accordance with IRC Chapter 415(d), but only for the 
year in which such adjustment is effective). If retirement benefits begin after age 65, the dollar 
limitation of subsection (a) shall be increased actuarially by using an interest assumption equal to the 
lesser of five percent or the rate used for actuarial equivalence. 
(e) ?Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code 
shall be disregarded. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than 
the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. 
"Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after 
December 31, 1995.

not later than the required beginning date set forth below, over a period not extending beyond the life 
expectancy of the police officer and a beneficiary designed in accordance with subsection (5)(h). 
(b) ?Any and all benefit payments shall begin by the later of: 
(1) ?April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the member's retirement date; or 
(2) ?April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member attains age 
seventy and one-half (70½). 
(c) ?If an employee dies before his entire vested interest has been distributed to him, the remaining 
portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as provided for under subsection (7). 
(Ord. No. 6-1997, § 3, 3-6-97) 


Sec. 50-133. - False or misleading statements made to obtain retirement benefits prohibited. 
(a) ?It is unlawful for a person to willfully and knowingly make, or cause to be made, or to assist, 
conspire with, or urge another to make, or cause to be made, any false, fraudulent, or misleading 
oral or written statement or withhold or conceal material information to obtain any benefit under this 
plan. 
(b) ?A person who violates subparagraph (a) commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as 
provided in Section 775.082 or 775.083, Florida Statutes. 
(1) ?In addition to any applicable criminal penalty, upon conviction for a violation described in 
subparagraph (a), a participant or beneficiary of this plan, may, in the discretion of the board of 
trustees, be required to forfeit the right to receive any or all benefits to which the person would 
otherwise be entitled under this plan. For purposes of this subparagraph "conviction" means a 
determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is 
withheld.

Sec. 50-135. - Annual adjustments. 
(a) ?Subject to the conditions set forth in this section, the board of trustees shall annually authorize an 
annual adjustment, the amount of which shall be determined as of each September 30. The amount 
of the annual adjustment shall be equal to the actuarial present value of future pension payments to 
current pensioners multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the rate of investment return 
and 8.5 percent. The actuary shall determine whether there may be an annual adjustment based on 
the following factors: 
(1) ?The actuary for the pension fund shall determine the rate of investment return on the pension 
fund assets during the 12-month period ending each September 30. The rate determined shall 
be the rate reported in the most recent actuarial report submitted pursuant to Chapter 112, Part 
VII, Florida Statutes. 
(2) ?The actuary for the pension fund shall, as of September 30, determine the actuarial present 
value of future pension payments to current pensioners. The actuarial present values shall be 
calculated using an interest rate of 8.5 percent a year compounded annually, and a mortality 
table approved by the board of trustees and as used in the most recent actuarial report 
submitted pursuant to Chapter 112, Part VII, Florida Statutes. This will be the pool of funds 
available to fund the annual adjustment. 
(3) ?If the actuary determines there may be an annual adjustment, the board of trustees shall 
authorize such an adjustment unless the administrative expenses of distribution exceed the 
amount available for the distribution. 
(b) ?Annual adjustments shall be made to all pensioners who have been retired for at least one year on 
the distribution date. Annual adjustments will be paid to beneficiaries who are receiving monthly 
benefits, provided the retiree (or the retiree and the beneficiary combined) was in receipt of a 
pension benefit for at least one (1) year on the distribution date. 
(c) ?The annual adjustment will be made as a percentage of the benefit and the percentage will be the 
same for all recipients. The amount of the percentage increase will be determined by the fund's 
actuary in accordance with the above procedure. The percentage increase will be equal to the 
amount that can be fully funded by the pool of funds available but not to exceed four (4) percent in 
any year and determined by that procedure. If the pool of funds available is greater than four (4) 
percent in any given year, then the remainder will be placed in an annual adjustment reserve 
designated for future annual adjustment distributions. 
(d) ?The annual adjustments shall be made as of July 1 and each July 1 thereafter, provided a person 
was retired for at least one year on July 1. 
(e) ?Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a)(d), for police officers who are employed and 
have not reached the normal retirement date prior to September 13, 2012, there shall be no cost of 
living adjustment applied to benefits earned based on creditable service on and after that date; and 
for any police officers hired on or after September 13, 2012, there shall be no cost of living 
adjustment.

    Beginning October 1, 2004, all retirees in payment status are entitled to a monthly supplemental 
pension benefit equal to twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) per year of service. This benefit is payable 
monthly for the life of the retiree. This benefit is payable to a surviving beneficiary of a retiree on a 
monthly basis for the period of time that the surviving beneficiary is in receipt of a pension in accordance 
with the form of benefit chosen at the time that benefits begin.

Sec. 50-137. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a) ?Any retiree who is retired under this fund, except for disability retirement, may be reemployed by 
any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment 
without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this fund. 
Reemployment of a retiree by the city on or after January 1, 2016, shall be subject to the limitations 
set forth in this section. 
(b) ?Reemployment in a position other than as a police officer. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this plan, a retiree who is retired from the fund on a normal retirement at normal retirement age and 
who is subsequently reemployed by the city in a position other than as a police officer shall, upon 
being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits from this fund. The benefit paid from this fund shall 
not be changed in any way by such reemployment. 
(c) ?Reemployment as a police officer. In the event a retiree who is retired from the fund is subsequently 
reemployed by the city as a police officer or into a position that supervises police officers, the benefit 
payable to the retiree from this fund shall be suspended for the period of such reemployment, until 
the retiree terminates employment with the city. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a retiree 
who is retired from the fund on a normal retirement at normal retirement age may be reemployed by 
the city as part of the city's reserve police force under policy and procedure 3.2.9 and continue to 
receive benefits from the fund. 
(d) ?Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a), (b), or (c) above, a retiree who has retired on an 
early retirement or a disability retirement may not be reemployed by the city and continue to receive 
a benefit from this fund.

(2) ?Gains or losses at the same rate of return earned by pension fund assets. 
a. ?The rate of return applied will be determined by the investment consultant using the 
Modified Dietz formula and will be credited or debited to the member's DROP balance on a 
quarterly basis. 
1. ?The quarterly rate of return is calculated in a two-step process. Step 1 is to calculate 
each month's rate of return using the Modified Dietz formula. Step 2 is to link the 
monthly returns together. 
Step 1 (Calculate the monthly returns using the Modified Dietz Formula) 
 
Where: 
EMV is the ending market value 
BMV is the beginning market value 
F is the net external inflow for the period (contributions to a portfolio are entered as 
positive flows while withdrawals are entered as negative flows). The investment 
manager fee is not included in this calculation (net of fees). Other expenses, 
including, but not limited to, investment consultant, custodial, actuarial, administrative, 
and legal fees are included. 
 
The sum of each flow F i multiplied by its weight W i The weight W i is the proportion of 
the time period between the point in time when the flow F i occurs and the end of the 
period. W i can be calculated as 
 
Where CD is the number of calendar days during the return period being calculated, 
which equals end date minus start date plus 1. D i is the number of days from the start 
of the return period until the day on which the flow F i occurred. This assumes that the 
flow happens at the end of the day. 
Step Two (Link the Monthly Returns) 
Link the returns geometrically in the following fashion: 
[ (1+R 1 ) x (1 + R 2 ) x (1 + R 3 ) ] - 1 = Quarterly Rate of Return 
Where: 
R 1 = Return of Month 1 
R 2 = Return of Month 2 
R 3 = Return of Month 3 
b. ?The rate is net of the investment manager fees, the custodian fees, and the investment 
consulting fees. These amounts are reported monthly by the administrator and are 
reported annually by the auditor. 
c. ?Statements are effective December 31 st , March 31 st , June 30 th , and September 30 th . 
However, if a police officer does not terminate employment at the end of participation in the 
DROP, interest credits shall cease on the DROP balance. An employee's DROP account 
shall be assessed an administrative fee that is based upon the ratio that the Employee's 
DROP account bears to the Fund as a whole. 
(c) ?No payments will be made from the DROP until the member terminates employment with the city. 
(d) ?Upon termination of employment, participants in the DROP will receive the balance of the DROP 
account in accordance with the following rules: 
(1) ?Members may elect to begin to receive payment upon termination of employment or defer 
payment of the DROP until the latest day as provided under subsection (d)(3) of this section. 
(2) ?Payments shall be made in either: 
a. ?Lump sum. The entire account balance will be paid to the retirant upon approval of the 
board of trustees. 
b. ?Installments. The account balance will be paid out to the retirant in three (3) equal 
payments paid over three years, the first payment to be made upon approval of the board 
of trustees. 
c. ?Annuity. The account balance will be paid out in monthly installments until the entire 
balance is exhausted. At the direction of the participant, the account balance can be used 
to purchase an annuity to be paid monthly, the first payment to be made upon approval by 
the board of trustees. The annuity must be purchased from an insurer licensed to sell such 
annuities in the state. 
(3) ?Any form of payment selected by a police officer must comply with the minimum distribution 
requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9), and is subject to the requirements of section 50-132, e.g. 
payments must commence by age seventy and one-half (70½). 
(4) ?The beneficiary of the DROP participant who dies before payments from the DROP begin shall 
have the same right as the participant in accordance with subsection 17 of the IRC 401(A)(9).

Sec. 50-153. - Police share plan. 
    A defined contribution plan component (share plan) is hereby established as part of the police 
officers' pension fund pursuant to F.S. § 185.35(6). The share plan shall be funded solely and entirely by 
Chapter 185 premium tax revenues allocated to the share plan, as provided herein. The share plan 
benefit is in addition to the benefits provided by the pension fund. 
(a) ?Eligible members and share accounts. Members with at least one (1) year of credited service 
who are contributing to and participating in the pension fund on or after July 27, 2017, and 
police officers who retire on or after that date shall be eligible to participate in the share plan. 
Members who retired before July 27, 2017, members who are participating in the DROP on that 
date, former members who left city employment before July 27, 2017, and the beneficiary of any 
member shall not be eligible to participate in the share plan. The board shall create an individual 
member share account for each eligible member, and maintain appropriate books and records 
showing the respective interest of each eligible member. The maintenance of separate share 
accounts is for accounting purposes only, and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to 
each account shall not be required. 
(b) ?Allocation of Chapter 185 premium tax revenues to the share plan. 
(1) ?Initial allocation. One-half of the accumulated excess Chapter 185 premium tax revenues 
($154,256.00) on October 1, 2016, shall be allocated to the share plan as soon as 
administratively practical after the adoption of this ordinance. 
(2) ?Annual allocation. Each year, as soon as administratively practical after October 1, an 
annual allocation shall be made to the share plan in an amount equal to one-half of the 
Chapter 185 premium tax revenues received during the preceding plan year in excess of 
$475,215.00 (the amount received in August 2013). For the plan year ending September 
30, 2016, the amount to be allocated to the share plan is $84,022.00 (one-half of 
$168,044.00), and this allocation shall be made as soon as administratively practical after 
the adoption of this ordinance. 
(c) ?Share account funding. The total amount of Chapter 185 premium tax revenues allocated to the 
share plan each year shall be divided equally among all eligible members as of September 30 
of the year in which the allocation is made, with each eligible member receiving an equal share 
of the total; except that for the first allocation following the establishment of the share plan, the 
total amount of Chapter 185 premium tax revenues allocated to the share plan shall be divided 
equally among all eligible members as of July 27, 2017. Share plan monies credited to actively 
employed police officers shall be placed in the officer's share account. Share plan monies 
credited to retired members shall be paid directly to the member in a one-time payment each 
year that Chapter 185 premium tax revenues are allocated to the share plan. 
(d) ?Interest on share accounts. As of September 30 each year, the share account balance of each 
actively employed member shall be credited with interest at the rate of six and one-half (6.5) 
percent per annum. Share plan payments to retired members shall not be credited with interest. 
(e) ?Allocation of costs, fees, and expenses. As of September 30 each year, each individual share 
account shall be adjusted to allocate the costs, fees, and expenses of administration of the 
share plan. Costs, fees, and expenses of administration shall be allocated to each individual 
member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees, and expenses of 
administration of the fund as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total 
assets in each individual member share account and the denominator of which is the total 
assets of the fund as a whole. Payments to retired members shall not be adjusted to allocate 
the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. 
(f) ?Annual statements. The board shall provide each eligible member with an annual statement 
setting forth their share account balance as of September 30 each year, and each retiree who 
receives a share plan payment shall receive a statement reflecting the payment. 
(g) ?No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share 
account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of 
the pension fund or in the Chapter 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, 
and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
(h) ?Forfeitures; distribution of share account balance in the event of disability or death. An eligible 
member who terminates city employment with less than five (5) years of credited service, other 
than for disability or death, shall forfeit his individual member share account. An eligible member 
who terminates city employment with more than five (5) but less than ten (10) years of credited 
service, other than for disability or death, shall forfeit the non-vested portion of his individual 
member share account, with the vested percentage determined in accordance with section 50-
120. In the event an eligible member terminates city employment due to disability or death, the 
member or the member's designated beneficiary shall receive the member's share account 
balance as of the date of disability or death. A member's share account is also subject to 
forfeiture as provided in F.S. § 112.3173. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other 
individual member accounts, except as otherwise required by law. 
(i) ?Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment and is eligible to receive retirement 
benefits under the pension fund, the member's share account balance shall be paid to the 
member, or in the event of the member's death to the member's designated beneficiary, within 
ninety (90) days following termination of employment. 
(j) ?Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section shall be paid only from the 
Chapter 185 premium tax revenues allocated to individual member share accounts, plus 
interest, or paid directly to retirees as provided herein. Neither the city nor the board shall have 
any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities, or other assets to fund share 
account benefits.

(Ord. No. 4, 2015, § 1(Exh. A), 6-4-15; Ord. No. 20, 2017, § 2, 12-7-17) 


Sec. 62-190. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the 
placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting 
and administering reasonable rules and regulations consistent with state and federal law, including F.S. §

Sec. 62-191. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the 
meanings given. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary 
meaning. 
    Abandonment means the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that 
this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical 
structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable 
within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public 
rights-of-way. 
    Antenna means communications equipment that transmits or receives electromagnetic frequency 
signals used in providing wireless services. 
    City means the City of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. 
    Collocate or collocation means to install, mount, maintain, modify, operate, or replace one (1) or 
more wireless facilities on, under, within, or adjacent to a wireless support structure or utility pole. The 
term does not include the installation of a new utility pole or wireless support structure in the public rights-
of-way. 
    Communications services means the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, 
video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any 
electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or 
hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in F.S. § 202.11(2), as it may be 
amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers may 
be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
    Communications services provider means any person, including a municipality or county, providing 
communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public 
rights-of-way. This definition shall also include any person, including a municipality or county, that places 
or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications 
services. 
    Communications facility or facility or system means any permanent or temporary plant, equipment, 
and property, including, but not limited to, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, 
converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, 
appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in 
the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, 
distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
    In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way means in, on, over, under, or across the public 
rights-of-way. 
    Micro wireless facility means a small wireless facility having dimensions no larger than twenty-four 
(24) inches in length, fifteen (15) inches in width, and twelve (12) inches in height and an exterior 
antenna, if any, no longer than eleven (11) inches. 
    Person shall include any individual, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, 
business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, 
assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the 
city to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
    Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining means to erect, construct, 
install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate, or relocate. A communications 
services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-
way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person 
providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is 
not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The 
transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does 
not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way means a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, 
tunnel, or alley for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant 
access pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface, and the area 
below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not 
include any real or personal city property, except as described above, and shall not include city buildings, 
fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities, or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are 
situated in the public rights-of-way. 
    Registrant means a communications services provider that has registered with the city in accordance 
with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration or register means the process described in this article whereby a communications 
services provider provides certain information to the city.

Each antenna associated with the facility is located inside an enclosure of no more than six (6) cubic 
feet in volume or, in the case of antennas that have exposed elements, each antenna and all of its 
exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than six (6) cubic feet in volume; and 
All other wireless equipment associated with the facility is cumulatively no more than twenty-eight 
(28) cubic feet in volume. The following types of associated ancillary equipment are not included in 
the calculation of equipment volume: electric meters, concealment elements, telecommunications 
demarcation boxes, ground-based enclosures, grounding equipment, power transfer switches, cutoff 
switches, vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services, and utility poles or other 
support structures. 
    Utility pole , with regard to Chapter 62, means a pole or similar structure that is used in whole or in 
part to provide communications services or for electric distribution, lighting, traffic control, signage, or a 
similar function. The term includes the vertical support structure for traffic lights but does not include a 
horizontal structure to which signal lights or other traffic control devices are attached and does not include 
a pole or similar structure fifteen (15) feet in height or less. 
    Wireless facility means equipment at a fixed location that enables wireless communications between 
user equipment and a communications network, including radio transceivers, antennas, wires, coaxial or 
fiber-optic cable or other cables, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, 
regardless of technological configuration, and equipment associated with wireless communications. The 
term includes small wireless facilities. The term does not include: 
a. ?The structure or improvements on, under, within, or adjacent to the structure on which the 
equipment is collocated; 
b. ?Wireline backhaul facilities; or 
c. ?Coaxial or fiber-optic cable that is between wireless structures or utility poles or that is otherwise 
not immediately adjacent to or directly associated with a particular antenna. 
    Wireless infrastructure provider means a person who has been certified to provide 
telecommunications service in the state and who builds or installs wireless communication transmission 
equipment, wireless facilities, or wireless support structures but is not a wireless service provider. 
    Wireless provider means a wireless infrastructure provider or a wireless services provider. 
    Wireless services mean any services provided using licensed or unlicensed spectrum, whether at a 
fixed location or mobile, using wireless facilities. 
    Wireless services provider means a person who provides wireless services. 
    Wireless support structure means a freestanding structure, such as a monopole, a guyed or self-
supporting tower, or another existing or proposed structure designed to support or capable of supporting 
wireless facilities. The term does not include a utility pole. 
(Ord. No. 4, 2015, § 1(Exh. A), 6-4-15; Ord. No. 20, 2017, § 2, 12-7-17) 


Sec. 62-192. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a) ?A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city's building department in accordance 
with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place 
or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b) ?A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-
way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications 
facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes, or regulations may apply to the placement 
or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. 
Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access 
or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another entity's facilities. 
Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable 
city ordinances, codes, or regulations, including this article. 
(c) ?Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility 
in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city, which shall include the 
following information: 
(1) ?Name of the applicant; 
(2) ?Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection 
with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3) ?For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it 
provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4) ?Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that the 
registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this chapter, which acknowledgment shall not be 
deemed an agreement; 
(5) ?The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications 
services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications 
Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any; and 
(6) ?For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of 
authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the 
State of Florida, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department 
of State. 
(d) ?The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the city 
engineer and the public services director or their designees. If the applicant submits information in 
accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be effective, and the city shall notify the 
applicant of the effectiveness of the registration in writing. If the city determines that the information 
has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the city shall notify the applicant, in 
writing, of the non-effectiveness of the registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness. The city 
shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information from the 
applicant. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent 
applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has thirty (30) days 
after receipt of a notice of non-effectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in 
section 62-196 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(e) ?A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer 
place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no 
longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a 
registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public 
rights-of-way. 
(f) ?Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain, or the priority for the 
placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall 
establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit. Registrations are expressly subject to any 
future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city 
ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g) ?A registrant shall renew its registration with the city's building department by April 1 of even 
numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a 
registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the 
odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew 
until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required 
to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a 
registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing 
registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a 
registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the 
communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h) ?An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective 
registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a 
registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Ord. No. 4, 2015, § 1(Exh. A), 6-4-15; Ord. No. 20, 2017, § 2, 12-7-17) 


Sec. 62-193. - Notice of transfer, sale, or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells, or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a 
transfer, sale, or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer, or assignee shall be 
obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale, or assignment 
shall be provided by such registrant to the city's building department within twenty (20) days after the 
effective date of the transfer, sale, or assignment. If the transferee, buyer, or assignee is a current 
registrant, then the transferee, buyer, or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer, or 
assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer, or assignee shall register as provided in 
section 62-192 within sixty (60) days of the transfer, sale, or assignment. If permit applications are 
pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer, or assignee shall notify the building official that 
the transferee, buyer, or assignee is the new applicant after the requirements of this section are satisfied. 
(Ord. No. 4, 2015, § 1(Exh. A), 6-4-15; Ord. No. 20, 2017, § 2, 12-7-17) 


Sec. 62-194. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a) ?A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and 
federal law and city ordinances, codes, and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications 
facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b) ?A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-
way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, 
except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the 
public's health, safety, or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-
existing service. The registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or 
maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and 
shall be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to 
perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. The registrant 
acknowledges that, as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or 
regulations governing the placement, relocation, or maintenance of a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified 
in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine 
maintenance and repair activities that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c) ?As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in 
public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1) ?The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, 
where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of the facilities that will be 
located in public rights-of-way; 
(2) ?A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction 
methods or techniques); 
(3) ?A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way, in accordance with 
the standards promulgated by the Florida Department of Transportation; 
(4) ?Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if 
available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent 
obtained from other persons); 
(5) ?If appropriate, given the facility proposed, a certified estimate of the cost of restoration to the 
public rights-of-way, subject to approval by the city engineer or designee; 
(6) ?The timetable for construction of the project, or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city 
which will be affected; and 
(7) ?Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the 
placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit 
application to review such permit application. 
(d) ?To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to 
prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area 
of public rights-of-way. 
(e) ?All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with 
the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property 
owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional 
bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way, as well as joint trenching or 
the co-location of facilities in existing conduit, is strongly encouraged and should be employed 
wherever feasible. The building official, public service director and city engineer or their designees 
may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a 
communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(f) ?All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be 
used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(g) ?After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-
of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way 
to their original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty 
(30) days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, 
following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and 
charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it 
may be amended. For twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work, the registrant 
shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct, at its own expense, any restoration work that 
does not satisfy the requirements of this article. 
(h) ?Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public 
rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be 
amended. 
(i) ?A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-
way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge 
upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j) ?A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent 
with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k) ?In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply 
with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may 
be amended. 
(l) ?The registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care, and skill in performing work in the public 
rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work-site areas. 
(m) ?Upon the request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation, 
or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance 
activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation, or repairs that may be 
occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable time frame in the subject public rights-of-way, 
and the registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as 
necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(n) ?A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, 
damage, or destroy any facilities, including, but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm 
drains, pipes, cables, or conduits of the city or any other entity's facilities lawfully occupying the 
public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o) ?The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of 
the city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities, and any performance of 
work, costs incurred, or services provided by the registrant shall be at the registrant's sole risk. 
Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate, or abandon public rights-of-way, 
and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated, 
or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p) ?The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or 
maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q) ?A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-
way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public 
rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant 
shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format 
specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a 
format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(r) ?The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, 
water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables, or conduit, and 
to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may 
be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The 
city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed the grading, 
installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said 
limits as same may from time to time be altered. Should the registrant be required to relocate its 
facilities in conjunction with such installation and alteration, the registrant shall be required to pay all 
costs associated with such relocation. 
(s) ?A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise 
or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of 
such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and 
the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be 
given not less than thirty (30) days' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(t) ?A wireless facility that is a portion of a communication facility, such as an antenna ("wireless 
facility(ies)"), which is attached to a legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way,

compliance is subject to appeal as provided in section 62-196, the city may exercise any 
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, taking possession of the 
facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the 
facilities or requiring the registrant within ninety (90) days of the termination, or such longer 
period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove some or all of the facilities from the 
public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to their original condition before the 
removal. 
(d) ?In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every 
portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(e) ?In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the city to cause the 
removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or 
another entity that owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or 
license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and is 
registered with the city, if required.

litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost if in the city's reasonable belief there exists or may 
exist a conflict, potential conflict, or appearance of a conflict. Nothing contained in this section shall

receipt shall not be valid for any longer time nor for any other place than that for which it was 
originally issued. The original business tax receipt shall be surrendered to and filed with the city at 
the time application for transfer is made, and such transferred business tax receipt, after being 
approved, shall be of the same force and effect as the original business tax receipt. At the time any 
business tax receipt is transferred, the person applying for such transfer shall pay to the city a 
transfer fee, the amount of which shall be set by ordinance of the city council and amended from

the proposed assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the 
assessment. The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment 
Collection Act. Notice shall be mailed at least 20 calendar days prior to the hearing to each property 
owner at such address as is shown on the tax roll within 90 days prior to the date of mailing. Notice shall 
be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service. The city clerk may 
provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or 
inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for 
the payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this ordinance.

assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected 
owner in the manner described in section 66-166 hereof, providing the date, time and place that the 
city council will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard.

of the subject site via first-class mail at least 14 days prior to the meeting. The growth 
management director shall have the discretion to extend the notice area. The applicant 
shall submit an affidavit to the city's growth management department with a list of noticed 
property owners at least ten days prior to the meeting. The notice shall comply with the 
public notice requirements as outlined in subsection 78-54(b). 
(i) ?Liens and fines. A development order application of any type shall not be scheduled for 
consideration at a preliminary review, workshop, regular meeting, special meeting, or public hearing 
of the planning, zoning, and appeals board or city council unless all liens or fines owed to the city for 
the subject property have been paid. 
(j) ?Withdrawal of development order application. A development order application shall be declared 
withdrawn in the event the applicant has not responded within 30 days to a request from the growth 
management director or designee, the planning, zoning, and appeals board, or the city council for 
additional information, plans, or other materials. The growth management director may grant one 
additional 30-day period in which the applicant shall respond to the request for additional information

thereto, complies with adopted level of services standards or complies with the city's 
concurrency requirements. 
(4) ?City benefit. Whether concurrent processing will benefit the city and will not cause an undue 
burden or adverse impact to the city. 
(c) ?Cessation of processing. If at any time during the concurrent processing, an applicant fails to satisfy 
any of the criteria of this section, such as the filing of an objection with the city, then concurrent 
processing shall immediately cease. The applicant is responsible at all times to comply with the 
requirements and criteria for concurrent processing and bears all risks for failure of an application to 
proceed in a timely fashion. 
(d) ?Concurrent processing agreement. At the city's discretion, an applicant may be required to enter 
into a concurrent processing agreement. The agreement shall set forth any and all conditions which 
the city deems necessary to ensure master planning or site planning of the affected site is 
completed. The city may include reasonable restrictions or limitations on use of the affected property. 
Acceptance of the agreement by the applicant shall be a prerequisite for approval of concurrent 
processing. The city council, by resolution, shall approve all concurrent processing agreements and 
amendments thereto. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 21, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 29-2004, § 4, 8-19-04)

days of the date of the notification, the applicant shall submit all information necessary to 
remedy the deficiencies. The director may waive the 30-day requirement if reasonable progress 
is being made to remedy the application. An application shall not be subject to further review 
until all deficiencies are remedied. Failure of an applicant to respond within the 30 days to a 
notice of deficiency shall void the application. 
(d) ?Development review committee. The development review committee (DRC) shall review all

following criteria: 
a. ?Conformity of the proposed development with the comprehensive plan, this chapter, and 
other applicable ordinances of the city; 
b. ?Characteristics of the site and surrounding area, including important natural and manmade

h. ?Impact on public schools, unless otherwise addressed as a requirement of the city's 
concurrency management system; and 
i. ?Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles; and 
j. ?Other applicable factors and criteria prescribed by the city. 
(2) ?Request for additional information. When an application has been considered by the DRC,

a. ?The requested information shall be submitted by 12:00 noon at least seven working days, 
excluding holidays, prior to the next scheduled DRC or planning, zoning, and appeals 
board meeting, as applicable. 
b. ?When the additional information requires the review of the city engineer, the information 
shall be submitted by 12:00 noon at least 15 working days, excluding holidays, prior to the 
next scheduled DRC or planning, zoning, and appeals board meeting, as applicable. 
(3) ?DRC certification and approval. Certification of an application by the development review 
committee is contingent upon such factors as a complete application, compliance with all 
comprehensive plan and land development regulation requirements, receipt of all requested 
additional information, and satisfaction of all comments. Certification of an application by the 
development review committee is mandatory prior to any further processing of a development 
order application. After an application for a major conditional use is certified by the development 
review committee, the application shall be scheduled for a public hearing before the planning, 
zoning, and appeals board. 
(4) ?In the review of minor conditional use applications, the development review committee shall

approved number of gross square footage which is equal to or greater than five (5) percent 
of the approved gross square feet of all nonresidential structures. 
b. ?Decrease in required parking. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, any proposed 
decrease of the existing number of parking spaces which is the greater of five percent of 
the existing parking spaces or 20 parking spaces. Decreases in required parking otherwise 
requiring action by the planning, zoning and appeals board or the city council shall not be 
considered a major amendment for the purpose of this section. 
c. ?Increase in the number of structures. Any proposed increase in the number of principal or 
accessory structures that changes the overall intent of the original approval. 
d. ?Any proposed reduction of heavily utilized parking spaces as determined by the growth 
management director. 
(2) ?Increase in density. Any increase in the approved number of residential units. 
(3) ?Increase in building height above the height permitted in the applicable zoning district. 
(4) ?Utility facilities. Any addition or relocation of outdoor utility facilities, including, but not limited to, 
the following: chillers, air-conditioning units, above-ground fuel tanks including propane or 
natural gas, electrical equipment such as junction boxes, and ground-mounted service boxes for 
public utilities such as telephones and cable television, which are deemed to be substantial by 
the growth management director. This shall not apply to single-family lots or duplex lots. 
(5) ?Boundary changes. Any proposed boundary change of the approved development plan. 
(6) ?Traffic impact. Any increase in overall traffic impact, except as may be provided in this chapter. 
(7) ?Character and appearance. Any amendment which would negatively impact the character or 
the appearance of an approved development. 
(8) ?Amenities. Any amendment which would materially decrease the number or size of amenities 
in all or a portion of any residential or nonresidential development. 
(9) ?Residential unit types. Any change in the approved mix of residential dwelling unit types that 
would require alterations of an approved plat. 
(10) ?Architectural style. Any change in the approved architectural style of residential dwelling unit 
types or nonresidential structures which results in: 
a. ?An architectural style that is out of character with the approved or existing architecture 
(e.g., change from Mediterranean style to neo-classical). 
b. ?New residential models that are substantially different from approved models. 
(11) ?Building materials. Any significant changes in exterior building materials that result in a 
downgrade as determined by the growth management director. 
(12) ?Changes to phasing or conditions. Any changes to an approved development phasing plan or 
any condition of development approval. 
(13) ?Changes to developer's agreements. Any changes to an approved developer's agreement. 
(14) ?Other changes. Any change to an approved plan or any change to an approved plan when 
considered cumulatively with prior minor amendments which, as determined by the growth 
management director, deviates materially from the approval granted by the planning, zoning, 
and appeals board or city council. 
(c) ?Minor amendments. Minor amendments are changes to approved development orders that are not 
considered major amendments as previously defined. Minor amendments may be approved by the 
growth management director in consultation with other city staff and the development review 
committee. For the purpose of this section, site improvements such as the following are not 
considered a major amendment: 
(1) ?Removal of parking spaces to preserve existing trees; creation of required utility easements; 
(2) ?Relocation of parking due to loss of site area to accommodate widening of public rights-of way; 
and 
(3) ?The installation of landscaping, screening, or buffering associated with city-approved 
improvements to a nonconforming lot or structure. 
(d) ?Administrative variances. The growth management director or designee may issue administrative 
variances pursuant to the following conditions: 
(1) ?Structural encroachments into setbacks of no more than ten percent. The growth management 
director may issue an administrative variance for structural encroachments into a setback of no 
more than ten percent of the setback, provided the structural encroachment does not encroach 
upon an easement. 
(2) ?Conditions. The growth management director may impose such conditions in a development 
order granting an administrative variance as are necessary to accomplish the goals, objectives, 
and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and this section, including, but not limited to, limitations 
on size, bulk, location, requirements for lighting, and provision of adequate ingress and egress. 
(3) ?Standards for granting administrative variances. When considering an administrative variance, 
the growth management director must determine that a) the variance is necessary because of 
practical difficulty peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which is not applicable 
to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district; b) the variance is the 
minimum variance necessary to alleviate the practical difficulty; and c) the variance will be in 
harmony with the general intent and purpose of the zoning code, and will not be injurious to the 
area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(4) ?Expiration of administrative variances. An administrative variance granted by the growth 
management director shall automatically expire under the following conditions: 
a. ?The variance shall expire 12 months from the date of the written determination of the 
growth management director granting the administrative variance if a building permit has 
not been issued in accordance with the plans and conditions upon which the administrative 
variance was granted; and 
b. ?The administrative variance shall expire if a building permit issued in accordance with the 
plans and conditions upon which the administrative variance was granted expires and is 
not renewed pursuant to the applicable provisions regarding renewal of building permits. 
(5) ?Appeal of growth management director's decision. A petitioner may appeal the written 
determination of the growth management director to the planning, zoning, and appeals board in 
accordance with the procedures set forth at section 78-56. 
(e) ?Exemptions to architectural review requirements. The growth management director, or designee, 
may administratively approve exemptions from city council review and approval for minor 
architectural modifications to the exteriors of residential structures previously approved by 
development order as part of a residential planned community development (PCD). An application 
for exemption shall be processed administratively in accordance with this section. However, the 
growth management director may require city council review and approval if it is determined that the 
modification sought does not constitute a minor modification as set forth herein. Applications for 
exemptions shall be reviewed pursuant to the following criteria: 
(1) ?Minor architectural modifications shall be limited to building color, roofing materials/color, and 
other minor architectural features, such as window and door treatments or architectural trim or 
decorations, so long as such modifications do not alter or deviate from the overall architectural 
style of the development, as determined by the growth management director, or designee. 
Minor modifications shall specifically exclude patio enclosures, conversion of screen enclosures 
into enclosed rooms, garage conversions, building additions, or any encroachment into 
established setbacks. 
(2) ?Only residential PCD communities that have an active, resident-controlled property owners 
association (POA) with the authority to enforce community architectural standards shall be 
eligible to apply for an exemption from architectural review requirements. 
(3) ?The POA of the community seeking an exemption shall submit an application for an exemption 
to the growth management department. The application shall include documentation necessary 
to demonstrate the following: 
a. ?The POA is an active, legally incorporated POA and continues to have authority within the 
development. 
b. ?The POA has community approval of the application, such as a vote by the POA members 
and/or minutes of the POA board meeting approving submittal of the exemption 
application. 
c. ?The POA has notified its residents and property owners of the application for exemption. 
Such notice must be provided via U.S. mail to each property owner within the community 
and/or by posting signs located at each entrance/exit of the community. 
d. ?Evidence that the POA has sufficient standards and powers in its POA documents to 
approve minor architectural revisions and to enforce architectural standards. 
e. ?Application fee. 
f. ?Additional information may be required by the growth management department in order to 
properly process the application. 
(4) ?Conditions of approval. The growth management director, or designee, may approve, deny, or 
approve with conditions the exemption request. 
(5) ?Appeals. A petitioner may appeal the administrative decision of denial or approval of the 
exemption to the planning, zoning, and appeals board in accordance with the procedures set 
forth within section 78-56, appeals and reconsideration. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 26, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 17-2004, § 5, 6-3-04; Ord. No. 19, 2004, § 3, 11-18-

Sec. 78-50. - Miscellaneous review. 
(a) ?Nature of review. When a development order application is not consistent with any of the 
development review processes provided herein, the growth management director shall determine the 
specific nature of review. 
(b) ?Signs. Sign plans may be submitted separately from site plan applications. If submitted separately, 
a sign plan shall be subject to review by the planning, zoning, and appeals board prior to

the minor conditional use. The applicant shall be responsible for composing and mailing or 
hand-delivering at least 15 days before the scheduled development review committee 
meeting the required public notices to the property owners affected by the minor 
conditional use. The applicant shall submit an affidavit to the growth management 
department director stating such notices were sent to all property owners within the 
designated area. 
b. ?The city clerk shall post a notice in a public place at the city hall complex at least 15 days 
before a scheduled development review committee giving the date and time of the meeting 
and the items to be considered. 
(2) ?Appeal procedure. Appeals from a decision by the development review committee shall be

b. ?Minor conditional uses. The growth management director shall have the right to compel 
removal of offending structures or uses that are accessory to or part of the minor 
conditional use at the cost of the violator and may record a lien against the property to

(3) ?Inspections. The growth management department shall review and inspect all conditional uses 
to ensure compliance with conditions of approval. 
a. ?All minor conditional uses which fail to comply with any or all conditions of approval shall 
be reported to the growth management director. The report shall specify the manner in 
which the landowner is not complying with one or more conditions of approval. The growth

b. ?All major conditional uses which fail to comply with any or all conditions of approval shall 
be reported in writing to the city council. The report shall specify the manner in which the 
landowner is not complying with one or more conditions of approval. The city council, upon 
receipt of the written report, may: 
1. ?Request timely compliance with the conditions of approval; 
2. ?Direct initiation of code enforcement proceedings pursuant to article VII; or 
3. ?Initiate procedures to revoke the major conditional use. If the city council initiates 
procedures to revoke the major conditional use, a hearing on the report shall be 
scheduled within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing 
shall be furnished to the landowner. If the city council finds that the facts alleged in the 
report are true, and that the landowner has not taken the steps necessary to fully 
comply with the conditions between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, 
the city council may authorize the city manager to revoke the major conditional use. 
The city council also may authorize the city manager and take the necessary legal 
action to terminate the major conditional use and all uses authorized by that approval. 
(f) ?Prior conditional uses. Any land use which was legally established prior to (date of adoption of this 
ordinance), and thereafter is classified by this chapter as a major or minor conditional use, will be 
considered a legal nonconforming use. 
(1) ?Amendments to prior conditional uses. Conditional use amendment applications shall be 
reviewed in the same manner as required by this section and as determined by the major or 
minor conditional use categories identified in section 78-159, table 21, charter of uses. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 29, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 6, 2005, § 6, 5-5-05; Ord. No. 16, 2014, § 1, 11-6-

Sec. 78-53. - Variance requests. 
(a) ?Development order applications. Applications for a development order approval for a variance shall 
be submitted and reviewed as provided in division 1 of article III. 
(b) ?Public hearing. The planning, zoning, and appeals board (PZAB) shall conduct a public hearing to 
review the application. As a basis for approval, the board must determine the application is 
consistent with the criteria listed below. 
(1) ?Special conditions. Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, 
structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or 
buildings in the same zoning district. 
(2) ?Hardship. The special conditions and circumstances truly represent a hardship, and are not 
created by any actions of the applicant. 
(3) ?Literal interpretation. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the 
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the 
terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(4) ?Special privileges. The grant of a variance will not confer upon the applicant any special 
privilege denied to any other owner of land, buildings, or structures located in the same zoning 
district. 
(5) ?Minimum variance. The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the 
use of the land, building, or structure. 
(6) ?Purpose and intent. The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and 
purpose of this chapter and land development regulations. 
(7) ?Financial hardship. Financial hardship is not to be considered as sufficient evidence of a 
hardship in granting a variance. 
(8) ?Public welfare. The grant of the variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise 
detrimental to the public welfare. 
(c) ?Approvals. In granting any variance, the PZAB may approve such conditions and safeguards 
deemed necessary to conform to the intent and purpose of this chapter. Violations of such conditions 
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The board may also prescribe a reasonable time limit to 
initiate the action granted by the variance and to complete such action. 
(d) ?Use variances prohibited. The PZAB, unless specifically authorized by this chapter, shall not grant a 
variance to establish a use not allowed as a permitted use or conditional use in any overlay or zoning 
district, or a use not allowed within a planned district. Evidence nonconforming uses of neighboring 
lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district or the permitted use of lands, structures, or 
buildings in other zoning districts shall not be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. 
(e) ?Variance from development standards prohibited. The PZAB, unless specifically authorized by this 
chapter, shall not grant a variance from the additional development standards of section 78-159, 
affecting permitting, conditional, or prohibited uses. 
(f) ?Variances in planned developments. The PZAB shall not grant a variance within any planned 
development, planned unit development, or planned community development overlay zoning district. 
Any deviation from applicable requirements shall be granted as a waiver by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 30, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 17-2004, § 5, 6-3-04) 


Sec. 78-54. - Public notice.

Sec. 78-57. - Targeted expedited permitting program. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. The targeted expedited permitting program provides qualifying projects an 
efficient process to resolve issues in a timely manner through face-to-face meetings with a city 
representative without sacrificing any requirements established in this chapter. The targeted 
expedited permitting program is available to qualifying companies that are expanding operations or 
moving into the city so that value-added employment may be created at a faster pace. 
(b) ?Applicability. The city shall utilize the following qualification criteria when determining whether a 
company qualifies for the targeted expedited permitting program: 
(1) ?The company must fall into one (1) of the following industry clusters: 
a. ?Medical and pharmaceutical; 
b. ?Aerospace and engineering; 
c. ?Information technology; 
d. ?Business and financial services; 
e. ?Education; 
f. ?Research and development; and 
g. ?Any other industry cluster or company headquarters approved by the city council. 
(2) ?The company must demonstrate the capability to create at least fifty (50) new positions in the 
City of Palm Beach Gardens within the first two (2) years of operation; or expand its operation 
within the city as a result of creating at least fifty (50) new positions in the two years prior to the 
issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the new facilities; or a combination thereof. 
(3) ?Positions created must be considered value-added employment based on the average wages 
and/or compensation paid by the employer. Value-added employment is defined when the 
average compensation package of positions created is at least ten (10) percent higher than the 
current per capita income level in the city. 
(4) ?Companies must pass the city's financial due diligence process to establish solvency and 
credibility prior to acceptance into the program. Due diligence reports (1) may include a Dun & 
Bradstreet report or other such reports as deemed necessary by the city, and (2) must be 
reviewed by the city manager, growth management administrator, and/or finance administrator 
for the city. 
(5) ?Notwithstanding the criteria above, a company may qualify for the targeted expedited 
permitting program if the company is a sanctioned project by the State of Florida or other 
officially sanctioned economic development organization (OTTED, Enterprise Florida, or 
Business Development Board of Palm Beach County). 
(c) ?Benefits. Companies that have been accepted into the targeted expedited permitting program shall 
receive the following benefits: 
(1) ?The city manager or growth management administrator shall appoint a single point of contact at 
the city who shall be kept apprised of all developments relating to the review of the project by 
the city's development review committee in order to keep the project on track and provide a 
periodic status report to the company's project manager; and 
(2) ?The growth management department shall establish the necessary steps required for project 
approval in a pre-application meeting, and subsequently, prepare an itemized timetable for the 
project's completion of the development review process; and 
(3) ?The project shall receive priority at every phase of the review process by city staff, including 
face-to-face meetings; and 
(4) ?The city's development review committee shall review and provide comments relative to the 
project not to exceed five (5) business days of submission of plans by the applicant; and

Sec. 78-58. - Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED). 
(a) ?Intent. The intent of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is to achieve the 
creation and re-creation of a safe, attractive, and economically viable physical environment and that 
the proper design and effective use of the physical environment would lead to a reduction in the 
incidence and fear of crime and an improvement in the quality of life. The "Design Out Crime" 
process involves a multi-faceted partnership to address target hardening, crime prevention, public 
safety, and traffic circulation. This is a multiphase process spanning from a preliminary conceptual 
design through perpetuity. 
(b) ?Applicability. All applicable development applications shall be reviewed for consistency with CPTED 
principles as part of the DRC process. 
(c) ?CPTED principles. CPTED is a proactive approach using four (4) crime prevention principles in the 
design and care of the built environment to reduce the incidence and fear of crime: 
(1) ?Natural surveillance: 
a. ?The placement and design of physical features, activities, and people to maximize visibility, 
increasing an offender's perceived risk of detection and apprehension. 
b. ?Lighting that provides for illumination of human activity utilizing current crime prevention 
lighting standards. 
(2) ?Natural access control: 
a. ?Limits the opportunity for crime by taking steps to clearly differentiate the transition from 
public space to private space. 
b. ?Limiting access and controlling pedestrian and vehicle flow into an area occurs with the 
selective placement of entrances and exits, fencing, lighting, and landscaping. 
(3) ?Territorial reinforcement: 
a. ?The use of physical attributes that express ownership of property, such as pavement 
treatments, landscaping, art, signage, screening, and fences. 
b. ?The perception of owned space creates an environment where suspicious users of an area 
stand out and are more easily identified. 
(4) ?Maintenance: 
a. ?The use of low maintenance landscaping and lighting treatments to facilitate the CPTED 
principles of natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial reinforcement. 
b. ?Continuous and long-term maintenance of an area fosters a positive image in the 
community and increases the overall quality of life for all users of the area.

Sec. 78-5978-60. - Reserved. 


DIVISION 2. - EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT ORDERS 


Sec. 78-61. - Effective period of development orders and enforcement of conditions. 
(a) ?Intent and purpose. The intent and purpose of this division shall be the items listed below: 
(1) ?Growth management act. In conformity with and in furtherance of the purpose of Chapter 163, 
Part II, entitled "the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development 
Regulation Act," referred to in this chapter as the Act, this division establishes and implements 
time limitations upon the initiation and completion of development to ensure that public facilities 
and services shall be available concurrent with the impacts of development. This division is 
intended to ensure the efficient and equitable distribution of capital facilities and services to 
proposed developments. The approval of proposed developments has caused the city to budget 
for and to reserve capacity for capital facilities and to plan for the delivery of services to the 
proposed development within the time prescribed. In order to ensure development has been 
initiated and is proceeding consistent with this division, the city shall monitor and review 
approved development orders to ensure consistency with the intent and purpose of this division 
and to further the goals, objectives, and policies of the city's comprehensive plan by: 
a. ?Increasing the availability of capital facilities and services for future developments by 
removing capacity reserved for approved developments that do not meet the requirements 
of this division by initiating and completing development within the time prescribed by this 
chapter or development approval; 
b. ?Minimizing the creation of an inventory of residential, commercial, and industrial 
development which is artificially inflated; 
c. ?Enhancing the value and use of land within the city by identifying and providing a system to 
revoke or amend development orders which have not been fully executed; and 
d. ?Ensuring compliance with conditions of development approval. 
(b) ?Suspension of development orders. Suspension of development orders may occur upon failure to 
comply with one or more time requirements or failure to comply with a condition of development 
approval. 
(1) ?Expiration of time periods. Upon expiration of any time period established by this chapter or 
failure to comply with, or continued violation of, a condition of development approval, no new 
development orders affecting the property shall be issued by the city, and no action which might 
tend to vest the development order shall be permitted, until a final determination is made 
pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. This suspension of development rights shall not 
preclude the property owner from filing a new petition for the subject property to amend or 
supersede an existing development order, or the city council or planning, zoning, and appeals 
board from approving this petition. If the property owner files a new petition, no new 
development orders shall be issued until the completion of the zoning process, except the 
development order which approves the petition. 
(2) ?Effect of suspension. This suspension of development rights shall have the following effect on 
new petitions and code enforcement action: 
a. ?If the property owner files a new petition, no new development orders shall be issued until 
the completion of the zoning process except the development order which approves the 
petition. 
b. ?If the city council or the planning, zoning, and appeals board directs staff to cite the 
property owner for violating the provisions of the development order, new development 
orders shall not be issued until the alleged violation has been ruled upon by the code 
enforcement board and any enforcement action is completed or penalty is satisfied. This 
shall not, however, preclude compliance with the specific condition after the city council or 
planning, zoning, and appeals board has directed the code enforcement division to cite the 
property owner for noncompliance with that condition. 
(c) ?Time limitations. Every development order shall include a time limitation by which build out of the 
project shall occur. 
(1) ?Variances. Unless the planning, zoning, and appeals board determines otherwise, an owner of 
record or successors or assigns shall commence construction of the improvement or 
improvements which are the subject of the variance within 12 months from the date of approval. 
Time extensions for such a development approval shall not be granted. If implementation of an 
approved variance is not initiated within such time frame, the approval shall be null and void. 
(2) ?Conditional uses. Such uses shall be initiated and placed in continuous use within two years or 
as otherwise provided in the development order approving such use. 
(3) ?Planned unit developments (PUD). An approved planned unit development shall have a build 
out date established in the development order, which date shall be based upon the required 
traffic impact analysis for the PUD. 
(4) ?Planned community districts (PCD). An approved PCD and each parcel within an approved 
planned community district shall have a build out date established in the development order, 
which date shall be based upon the required traffic impact analysis for the PCD. 
(5) ?Site plans not within a PCD or PUD. Site plans shall have a build out date established in the 
development order, which date shall be based upon the required traffic impact analysis for the 
site plan. 
(6) ?Development of regional impact. Time limitations pursuant to development orders for 
developments of regional impact which have been approved after August 18, 1994, shall be 
governed by the development order rendered for the project, as required pursuant to Section 
380.06(15)(c) 2 and 3, Florida Statutes. 
(7) ?Development orders approved prior to November 20, 2003. 
a. ?If a build out date established in a PUD, PCD or site plan development order has expired, 
or will expire before December 31, 2004, the build out date shall be deemed extended to 
December 31, 2004. 
b. ?If no build out date was established in a PUD, PCD, or site plan development order, the 
build out date shall be December 31, 2004. 
(d) ?Determination of project build out. 
(1) ?A PUD shall be deemed built out when (a) all plats for the PUD have been recorded; (b) all on-
site infrastructure within the PUD (roads, sewer, water, and drainage) has been substantially 
completed, except for the second lift of asphalt, which may be guaranteed by appropriate 
surety; (c) all common-area landscaping for the PUD has been installed or guaranteed; and (d) 
all traffic impacts have been mitigated or guaranteed by performance security. 
(2) ?A nonresidential PCD shall be deemed built out if (a) installation of all infrastructure (roads, 
sewer, water, and drainage) has been substantially completed, except for the second lift of 
asphalt, which may be guaranteed by appropriate surety; (b) building permits for square footage 
generating more than ten (10) percent of the total average daily trips as determined by the 
concurrency approval have been issued; (c) all traffic impacts have been mitigated or 
guaranteed by performance security; and (d) all common-area landscaping for the PCD has 
been installed or guaranteed by performance security. 
(3) ?A residential PCD shall be deemed built out if (a) installation of all infrastructure (roads, sewer, 
water, and drainage) has been substantially completed, except for the second lift of asphalt, 
which may be guaranteed by appropriate surety; (b) all plats for the PCD have been recorded; 
(c) all traffic impacts have been mitigated or guaranteed by performance security; and (d) all 
common-area landscaping for the PCD has been installed or guaranteed by performance 
security. 
(4) ?An individual pod within a PCD may be deemed built out if the pod has been platted and all 
other criteria in subsection (2) for nonresidential pods or subsection (3) for residential pods have 
been met for the individual pod. 
(5) ?Site plans not within a PUD or PCD shall be deemed built out if (a) installation of all

Secs. 78-6278-70. - Reserved. 


DIVISION 3. - CONCURRENCY 


Sec. 78-71. - Scope. 
    The method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the concurrency management system. The 
system is based upon the city comprehensive plan, especially the capital improvements element and 
adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure that the adopted levels of service 
for specific public facilities will be maintained upon issuance by the city of any development order. The 
system also includes a monitoring program for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of 
public facilities to meet the adopted level of service standards concurrent with project impacts. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 34, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-72. - Compliance with adopted levels of service. 
(a) ?Compliance. All development order applications, except those exemptions as provided for herein, 
shall demonstrate that the impacts from the proposed development comply with the level of service 
standards adopted by the city. 
(b) ?Concurrency determination required. All applications for development order approval shall include 
evidence of compliance with the city's concurrency requirements or an application to obtain a 
concurrency certificate. 
(c) ?Determination of available capacity. 
(1) ?Capacity determination. A determination of available capacity under this chapter is calculated 
by adding together all elements listed below. 
a. ?The total capacity of existing facilities when operating at the adopted level of service; and 
b. ?The total capacity of new facilities, operating at their adopted level of service, that will 
become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development. The capacity of 
new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown. 
1. ?Construction of the new facilities is underway at the time of issuance of the 
development order. 
2. ?The funds for construction of new facilities are included in the first three years of the 
adopted county five-year road program, or the adopted five-year state department of 
transportation improvement program, or the city five-year capital improvements 
element; 
3. ?The new facilities are the subject of a binding, executed contract for providing the 
facilities at the time of issuance of the development order. 
4. ?The new facilities are guaranteed in a legally enforceable developer agreement 
pursuant but not limited to F.S. Chapter 160 or Chapter 380. The developer 
agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities will be in place when the 
impacts of the development occur. 
(2) ?Capacity availability. The determination of available capacity is made by subtracting from the 
sum of subsections (c)(1)a. and (c)(1)b. of this section from the sum of: 
a. ?The demand for the facility created by existing development; and 
b. ?The demand for the facility that has been reserved for other proposed developments by the 
issuance of a valid concurrency certificate. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 35, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-73. - Action upon failure to show available capacity demonstration of available capacity. 
    Where available capacity cannot be shown pursuant to this division, the methods listed below may 
be used to maintain the adopted levels of service. 
(a) ?Provision of necessary improvements. The developer may provide the necessary 
improvements to maintain the adopted level of service. In such case, the development order 
application shall include conceptual plans for improvements, documentation that such 
improvements shall be designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the 
adopted level of service, and recordable instruments guaranteeing implementation consistent 
with the calculations of capacity. 
(b) ?Amended application. The development order application may be amended to comply with the 
adopted level of service. 
(c) ?Phasing. The development order application indicates the proposed project may be phased 
such that the projected level of service at the conclusion of each phase complies with the 
adopted level of service. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 36, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-74. - Burden of showing compliance. 
    The burden of showing compliance with the level of service requirements of this chapter shall be 
upon the applicant for the development order approval. In order to be processed and reviewed for 
approval, development order applications shall provide sufficient information showing compliance with 
these standards. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 37, 7-20-00)

shall be the Palm Beach County countywide traffic performance standards of the county, as 
amended. For city roads, the method of evaluation shall be the city traffic performance 
standards, as amended. For purposes of determining compliance with traffic performance 
standards applicable to state, county, and city roads, all applications shall be managed by the 
city. 
(2) ?Submission of traffic impact studies. Applications for development order approval, including 
traffic impact studies and relevant information, shall be submitted to the city. The city shall, if 
necessary, distribute all relevant information to the county for evaluation. The county will review 
projects in the order determined by the city. Review of applications for traffic concurrency shall

concurrency reservation or a certificate of conditional concurrency reservation shall be issued by the 
city. Concurrency certification does not constitute sufficiency with regard to the performance of 
existing or proposed infrastructure improvements. Performance of drainage systems, water and 
wastewater systems, solid waste collection, recreation facilities, and traffic operations are factors to 
be considered in the review and approval or denial of a proposed project. Certificates shall be issued 
as provided below. 
(1) ?Concurrency reservation. A certificate of concurrency reservation shall be issued if a 
determination is made that there is adequate capacity in all the public facilities to meet the 
impacts generated by the project. 
(2) ?Conditional concurrency reservation. Should there not be sufficient capacity in one or more of 
the necessary public facilities, the certificate of conditional concurrency reservation process 
may be used. 
(3) ?Denial or withdrawal. When a certificate of concurrency reservation or conditional concurrency 
reservation is issued, the certificate is valid while the application for development order approval 
is being processed. If the development order application is either denied or withdrawn, the 
concurrency certification becomes immediately void. 
(4) ?Existing development. If a development order application is filed to change an approved 
development order, the concurrency certification for the existing development order shall be 
applicable to the extent of equal or lesser impacts resulting from the proposed change. If the 
proposed change creates additional impacts, a concurrency certificate for the additional impacts 
shall be obtained. 
(5) ?Development order approval. When a development order for a project is approved, the 
concurrency certificate issued is valid for the time set forth in the development order, or any 
amendments or time extensions thereto. Otherwise, the certificate is valid for two years. 
(6) ?Failure to progress. If a project has not progressed in accordance with an approved 
development order and concurrency certificate, a time extension may be requested pursuant to 
division 2 of article III. For the purpose of this subsection, the term "project" includes the 
following development order applications: planned community district, planned unit 
development, mixed use development, subdivision plat, major site plan, and conditional use. 
(7) ?Failure to progressMinor projects. If a project has not progressed in accordance with an 
approved development order and concurrency certificate, a time extension may be requested 
pursuant to division 2 of article III. For the purpose of this subsection, the term "project" means 
a minor site plan or a building permit, for which the developer may request a time extension. A 
minor site plan application shall be considered and determined by the planning, zoning, and 
appeals board, while the building official shall consider and determine an application related to a 
building permit. 
(8) ?Failure to obtain concurrency certificate. If a time extension is not requested or if the time 
extension is not granted, the concurrency certificate shall automatically expire, and no further 
development activity can occur without obtaining a concurrency certificate.

Sec. 78-83. - Concurrency summary log. 
    The department will maintain a concurrency summary log. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 46, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-84. - Concurrency certificate decisions. 
    The growth management director or designee shall be responsible to review and decide upon each 
request for a concurrency certificate. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 47, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-85. - Appeals process. 
    Appeal of decisions of the growth management director shall be made to the BZA pursuant to 
section 78-23. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 48, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-86. - Proportionate fair-share program. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of 
development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and 
private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner 
consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). Proportionate fair-share payments shall be distinct and separate 
payments from and shall not be considered the same as impact fee payments. Impact fees are 
imposed by the city to replace capacity utilized by growth and to provide funding for long-range 
transportation plans. Proportionate fair-share is assessed to pay for specific deficiencies to the 
transportation network resulting from development and enabling development to meet level of 
service (LOS) concurrency requirements. Proportionate fair share enables development to meet 
concurrency requirements by proportionately paying for improvement projects. 
(b) ?Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments that fail to meet 
the standards of this division on a roadway within the city that is not the responsibility of Palm Beach 
County or the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The proportionate fair-share program 
does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRI) using proportionate fair share under F.S. § 
163.3180(12), projects exempted from this division, or for projects that received traffic concurrency 
approval prior to December 1, 2006. 
(c) ?General requirements. An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency 
requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution for impacts of new development on 
city roads that have or will have an LOS deficiency as defined in this division, pursuant to the 
following requirements: 
(1) ?The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land 
development regulations. 
(2) ?Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation shall meet the 
city's design standards for locally-maintained roadways. 
(3) ?The scope of the project shall provide for no less than the capacity necessary to address the 
transportation concurrency needs for the next five years after the execution of the fair share 
agreement. 
(4) ?The road improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS is specifically identified for 
construction in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the Capital Improvements 
Element (CIE) of the Comprehensive Plan. The provisions of subsection (4)a. may apply if a 
transportation project or projects are needed to satisfy concurrency and are not presently 
included within the city's CIE. 
a. ?If an applicant meets the criteria contained in subsection (c), and the city's CIE does not 
include the transportation improvements necessary to satisfy the LOS deficiency, then the 
city may allow transportation concurrency improvements and funding for the project 
through the proportionate fair-share upon compliance with the following criteria: 
1. ?The improvement shall not be contained in the first three years of the city's five-year 
schedule of capital improvements in the CIE; 
2. ?The city adopts by resolution a commitment to add the improvement funded by the 
developer's proportionate share assessment to the five-year schedule of capital 
improvements in the CIE at a point no later than the next scheduled annual update. 
To qualify for consideration under this section, the developer shall be required to 
submit for review and obtain the city's approval of the financial feasibility of the 
proposed improvement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180, consistent with the 
comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance; 
3. ?The city agrees to enter into a binding proportionate fair share agreement; 
4. ?The city agrees to amend the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city's 
CIE at the next annual review or if the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of 
capital improvements in the city's CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a 
transportation improvement required by the CMS to make the project concurrent, the 
city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the 
applicant; provided, however, that the proportionate fair-share amount in such 
agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which shall, in the 
opinion of the city council, alleviate the concurrency concern and the CIE is amended 
accordingly at the next annual review. 
(d) ?Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element 
of the Comprehensive Plan, the city shall coordinate with Palm Beach County and other affected 
jurisdictions, such as FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of 
the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal 
agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(e) ?Application process. 
(1) ?In the event of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall have 
the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share 
program pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c). 
(2) ?Prior to the submittal of an application, eligible applicants shall schedule a pre-application 
meeting with the growth management department. Subsequent to the pre-application meeting, 
eligible applicants shall submit a completed development application and all documentation 
requested by the city. The city shall establish applicable application fees for the cost of 
reviewing the application. If the impacted facility affects is on the strategic intermodal system 
(SIS), then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. The 
city shall also have the option of notifying and inviting Palm Beach County. 
(3) ?The growth management department shall review the application and certify that the 
application is sufficient and complete within 14 working days. If an application is determined to 
be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate 
fair-share program as indicated in subsection (c), then the applicant will be notified in writing of 
the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 
30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed withdrawn and 
all fees forfeited to the city. 
(4) ?Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for 
development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The 
applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for 
inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(5) ?When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised 
in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be 
prepared by the applicant and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to 
the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than 60 
days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient, complete, and 
eligible application. If the agreement is not received by the city within these 60 days, then the 
application will be deemed withdrawn and all fees forfeited to the city. 
(6) ?No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the growth 
management administrator through an administrative approval city council through a 
miscellaneous petition. 
(f) ?Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, 
separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution 
of facilities. 
(2) ?A development eligible for participation under the proportionate fair-share program shall not be 
required to pay more than its proportionate fair share. The fair market value of the proportionate 
fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of 
mitigation. 
(3) ?The methodology used to calculate a development's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be 
as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways 
during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by 
the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from 
construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the 
construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain 
the adopted LOS. 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = ?[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × 
Cost;sub \ sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \ sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under 
review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per TPS; 
SV Increase;sup \ sup; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to 
roadway segment "i" per Section 3; 
Cost;sub \ sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all 
improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, 
engineering review, inspection, administration, and physical development costs directly 
associated with construction at the anticipated cost, including contingencies, in the year it will be 
incurred. 
(4) ?For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city engineer shall 
determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated cost of the improvement 
in the year that construction will occur. 
(5) ?If an improvement is proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be 
based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and reviewed by the 
city engineer or other method approved by the city engineer. 
(6) ?If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit 
for the dedication of the right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 115 percent 
of the most recent assessed value by the property appraiser, or at the option of the applicant 
and in-lieu of the 115 percent of assessed value option, by fair market value established by an 
independent appraisal approved by the city at no expense to the city. This appraisal shall 
assume no approved development plan for the site. All right-of-way dedicated shall be part of a 
roadway segment that triggered the deficiency per TPS and shall not be site-related. The 
applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title 
search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way 
dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city-estimated total proportionate fair-
share obligation for that development, then the applicant shall also pay the difference. Prior to 
purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to 
be used for the proportionate fair share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for 
essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. The city shall also 
have the option of requiring an environmental assessment for right-of-way dedication. 
(g) ?Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against road impact fees to 
the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the 
same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the citywide impact fees division 
contained in this chapter. 
(2) ?Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the 
transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees 
owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they 
become due pursuant to the citywide impact fees division contained in this chapter. Once the 
credit has been exhausted, payment of road impact fees shall be required for each permit 
issued. The impact fee credit shall be established when the proportionate fair-share contribution 
is received by the city, or when the fair-share amount is secured by Performance Security. 
(3) ?The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a 
proposed project. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share 
contributions for a proposed project cannot be transferred to any other project. 
(h) ?Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1) ?Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement ("agreement"), the applicant shall 
receive a certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a 
development building permit within twelve (12) months, then the agreement and the certificate 
of concurrency approval shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to 
reapply. 
(2) ?Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full no later than the issuance of 
the first building permit, and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than 
ninety (90) days from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share 
cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection (f), and adjusted 
accordingly. 
(3) ?In the event an agreement requires the applicant to pay or build one hundred (100) percent of 
one (1) or more road improvements, all such improvements shall be commenced prior to the 
issuance of a building permit and assured by a binding agreement that is accompanied by a 
performance security, as determined by the city, which is sufficient to ensure the completion of 
all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be 
completed before the issuance of certificates of occupancy. 
(4) ?Dedication of necessary rights-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-
share agreement shall be completed prior to the issuance of the first building permit but shall 
not include a building permit issued for a dry model. 
(5) ?Any requested change to a development subsequent to a development order may be subject to 
additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate 
additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6) ?Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any 
time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising 
costs paid to the city will be nonrefundable. 
(7) ?The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements 
to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation 
facility. 
(i) ?Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding 
of scheduled improvements in the CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the 
proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may be used as the fifty 
(50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP, or any other matching requirement 
for state and federal grant programs as may be allowed by law. 
(2) ?In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues 
collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement 
within that same corridor or impact fee benefit zone that would mitigate the impacts of 
development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c)(3).

number shall include the plural and the plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates 
the contrary. 
(4) ?The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for," "designed for," "maintained for," or "occupied 
for." 
(5) ?The term "person" includes an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an incorporated 
association, or any other similar entity. 
(6) ?Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a regulation involves two or more 
items, conditions, provisions, or events connected by the conjunction "and," "or," or "either . . . 
or," the conjunction shall be interpreted as follows: 
a. ?"and" indicates that all the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events shall apply; 
b. ?"or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events may apply singly 
or in any combination; and 
c. ?"either . . . or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events shall 
apply singly but not in combination. 
(7) ?The term "includes" shall not limit a term to the specific example, but is intended to extend its 
meaning to all other instances or circumstances of like kind or character. 
(8) ?Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, the terms "public safety," "police 
protection," "fire protection," "emergency medical services (EMS)," "parks and recreation", 
"public facilities", and "public buildings" shall have the same meanings given those terms in the 
city's comprehensive plan. 
(9) ?For the purposes of this division, the term "road" shall mean those roads identified in the city's 
thoroughfare plan and city center linkages plan, as incorporated into the city's comprehensive 
plan. 
(10) ?The land use types listed in section 78-92 for police, fire/EMS, parks and recreation, and 
public facilities fees shall have the same meaning as in article IV pertaining to zoning. The land 
use types listed in section 78-92 for collector road fees shall be as described in the latest edition 
of the Institute for Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation manual, or as determined by the 
city engineer. 
(d) ?Imposition of fees. 
(1) ?Fees required. Any person who seeks to develop land by applying for the issuance of a 
building permit for one of the land use types specified in section 78-92 shall be required to pay 
an impact fee for the following services: roads, police protection, fire protection/EMS, parks and 
recreation, and public facilities in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter. 
(2) ?Building permits. A building permit shall not be issued until all applicable impact fees required 
have been paid. The amount of the impact fees shall be as set forth in the schedules provided 
herein. 
(3) ?Existing uses. When change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use requires 
the issuance of a building permit, any impact fees imposed shall be based upon the net 
increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous and/or "like" use as set 
forth in the schedules provided herein below and as determined by city policy. Changes in use 
that do not require a building permit, but yield a net increase in applicable impact fees shall not 
be allowed until the net impact fees associated with that change in use have been paid.

Sec. 78-97. - Collection and administrative fees. 
(a) ?Time of payment. The fee payer shall pay the road, police protection, fire protection/EMS, parks and 
recreation, and public facilities impact fees to the city prior to the issuance of a building permit that 
may be required for development listed in the schedules in section 78-92. A building permit shall not 
be issued for any development, unless exempt from such fees as provided herein, until such fees 
have been paid or until the city has accepted alternative payment as set out in this section; provided, 
however, that alternative payments for road impact fees shall be governed exclusively by section 78-
97(d) below. For land uses not requiring a building permit, the authorization to proceed shall not be 
granted until the impact fees have been paid. 
(b) ?Alternative payment. In lieu of all or part of the impact fees, the city council may accept an offer by a 
fee payer to dedicate land and/or construct all or part of a police protection, fire protection/EMS, 
parks and recreation, or public facilities project. Such construction must be in accordance with state, 
county, or city design standards, whichever is applicable. 
(1) ?Project construction. The fee payer shall submit a project description in sufficient detail to allow 
the city to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. 
(2) ?Land value. The manner of establishing fair market value of land to be dedicated shall be 
determined by the city council. Costs to determine the land value, such as an appraisal, shall be 
paid by the fee payer. 
(c) ?Acceptance. If the city council accepts alternative payment, the city manager shall credit the cost of 
this construction against the police protection, fire protection/EMS, parks and recreation, or public 
facilities impact fees otherwise due. The portion of the fee represented by facilities construction shall 
be deemed paid as follows: 
(1) ?When the construction is completed and accepted by the city; 
(2) ?When the fee payer posts security, as provided herein, for the costs of such construction; or 
(3) ?When the city has accepted title to land dedicated by the fee payer as full or partial credit for a 
required impact fee payment. 
All land dedicated to the city shall be conveyed free of any liens via warranty deed and the costs 
of conveyance shall be paid by the fee payer. Title insurance in favor of the city or an attorney's 
opinion of title shall be provided in a manner acceptable to the city attorney. 
(d) ?Surety or security. Security shall be posted with the city council, made payable to the city in an 
amount approved by the city manager equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the full cost of such 
construction. If the construction project will not be constructed within one (1) year of the acceptance 
of the offer by the city council, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten (10) percent 
compounded for each year of the life of the security. The type and form of the security shall be 
reviewed and approved by the city manager's office prior to acceptance of the security by city 
council. 
(e) ?Deposit of funds. All funds collected pursuant to this division shall be promptly transferred for 
deposit into the appropriate trust fund to be held in separate accounts as determined in section 78-

expansion related to the public purpose for which such fees were collected, with the exception of 
impact fee administrative costs pursuant to paragraph (f) below. Funds shall be expended in the 
order in which they are collected. 
(f) ?Administrative fee. The city shall be entitled to retain a portion of the impact fees it collects in order 
to offset the actual costs incurred administering this article. If impact fee funds which were paid by 
check, draft, or other negotiable instrument do not clear, the building permit or development order 
authorizing the development for which the impact fees were paid shall be suspended. The city shall 
send to the fee payer by certified mail notice of the suspension of a development order. If the impact 
fees, together with any charges for the funds not clearing, are not paid within ten (10) business days 
following mailing of the notice, the building permit or development order shall be of no further force 
and effect for purposes of this article and a stop-work order shall be issued. The stop-work order 
shall not be lifted until such time as the impact fees are paid. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 55, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 31-2000, § 5, 12-5-00; Ord. No. 22-2000, § 1, 12-7-

Sec. 78-98. - Refund. 
(a) ?Expiration of building permit. If a building permit expires and no construction has been commenced, 
the fee payer shall be entitled to a refund of the impact fees paid as a condition for its issuance, less 
any administrative fees incurred as a result of administering this article. No interest will be paid to the 
fee payer on refunds due to noncommencement. Refunds resulting from the city's miscalculation of 
impact fees shall not be charged the administrative fees on the amount refunded. 
(b) ?Change in status. No refunds shall be given for a change in land use or structure after occupancy 
has occurred. 
(c) ?Return of fees. Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter

Sec. 78-99. - Exemptions and credits. 
(a) ?Exemptions. Exemptions from payment of impact fees are established below. 
(1) ?No additional demand. Alteration or expansion of an existing building or use of land where no 
additional living units are created, where the use is not changed, and where no additional 
demand for road, police, or fire protection services will be produced over and above that 
produced by the existing use. 
(2) ?No additional living or dwelling units. The construction of accessory buildings or structures that 
will not produce additional living units over and above those located in the principal building or 
use of the land. 
(3) ?Replacement. The replacement of a building, mobile home, or structure that was in place on 
the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives or the replacement of a 
building, mobile home, or structure that was constructed subsequent thereto and for which the 
correct impact fee had been paid or otherwise provided for, with a new building, mobile home, 
or structure of the same use, provided that no additional impact will be produced over and 
above that produced by the original use of the land. 
(4) ?Public facilities. The construction of publicly owned governmental buildings or facilities. 
(5) ?Abandonments. A use of a structure or land that has been abandoned for a period of more than 
five (5) years shall not be considered an existing or ongoing use for purposes of exemptions or 
credits. Any previous payment of impact fees under this article shall be credited against the 
appropriate impact fees owed as a result of the change. The burden of demonstrating the 
existence of a use or structure or previous payment of impact fees shall be upon the fee payer. 
When a use is existing, any additional fees shall be based upon the alteration to the existing 
use or structure. 
(b) ?Credit. 
(1) ?Improvements. 
a. ?All improvements to and/or land dedications for police protection, fire protection and EMS, 
parks and recreation, or public facilities required under city development approval shall be 
credited against impact fees up to the total of the impact fees due. A fee payer proposing 
credit for land dedication shall present property appraisals prepared by qualified 
professionals and a certified copy of the most recent assessment of the property for tax 
purposes to be used in determining the amount of the credit. However, the city retains the 
right to determine the amount to be credited by preparing engineering and construction 
cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements and/or land dedications. 
b. ?Fee payers claiming credits for construction and/or land dedication shall submit 
documentation sufficient to permit the growth management director to determine whether 
such credits are due and, if so, the amount of such credits. 
c. ?In the event the cost of the improvements and/or land dedications exceed the total amount 
of impact fees due, the city council may, on a case-by-case basis and in the exercise of its 
discretion, allow the fee payer constructing such improvements and/or making such land 
dedications to pool impact fees for multiple developments or enter into funding agreements 
with other fee payers whose developments contribute to the need for such capital 
improvements. 
(2) ?Alteration, expansion, or replacement. Where alteration, expansion, or replacement of a 
building or unit, or a change in land use or presently existing which involves an increase in the 
number of units or square footage or a change in use resulting in new impacts on road, police, 
fire and EMS, parks and recreation, or public facilities for which the impact fee is assessed, 
credit shall be allowed as provided herein. Credit shall be given for the number of existing units 
or square feet based upon the existing or previous land use, and impact fees shall only be 
assessed on the increased level of impact resulting from such alteration, expansion, or 
replacement. 
(3) ?Residential buildings. For an addition to an existing residential building in which additional living 
units are created, the fee payer shall provide to the city manager a certification of an architect 
setting forth the square footage of the existing building. For an addition to an existing residential 
building, the fee payer, at his or her sole option, may pay the impact fee for the addition as if it 
alone was a new building rather than provide the certification of an architect setting forth the 
square footage of the existing building. 
(c) ?Failure to claim. Exemptions or credits must be claimed by the fee payer at the time of the 
application for a building permit. Any exemptions or credits not so claimed shall be deemed waived 
by the fee payer. 
(d) ?Alternative payment and credit for road impact fees. 
(1) ?In general. In lieu of paying or all a portion of the road impact fee, the fee payer may elect to 
construct road improvements identified in the city's thoroughfare plan or city center linkages 
plan. The fee payer shall submit a plan of construction, along with a certified engineer's cost 
estimate, to the growth management director and city engineer. 
(2) ?Construction standards. All roads constructed pursuant to this subsection shall comply with the 
requirements of the city's Code of Ordinances. 
(3) ?Calculation of credit. Based on the certified cost estimate submitted and any other relevant 
information acquired by or provided to the city, the city engineer shall determine the amount of 
credit to be given and the timetable for completion of the proposed construction. The city 
engineer shall certify the amount of the credit to the finance director. 
(4) ?Costs creditable. Credit shall be given only for the costs of plans preparation and construction. 
a. ?Plan preparation. Costs of plan preparation for city road network construction shall be 
credited if approved by the city engineer and the finance director based on reasonable 
costs associated with the preparation of such plans. 
b. ?Construction costs. Costs of construction shall include only roadway construction and all 
required sidewalks, striping, signage, and curbing. 
(5) ?Pooling. In the event the cost of the improvements exceeds the total amount of road impact 
fees due, the city council may, on a case-by-case basis and in the exercise of its discretion, 
allow the fee payer constructing such improvements to pool impact fees for multiple 
developments or enter into funding agreements with other fee payers whose developments 
contribute to the need for such capital improvements.

listed in section 78-125, regulated substances, shall be prohibited and/or restricted as set forth herein 
within the zones depicted in section 78-122, protected zones. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the subject 
restrictions shall not apply to parcels lying entirely within Zone 4. 
(1) ?Prohibited activities. The use, handling, production, and storage of regulated substances 
associated with nonresidential activities in quantities exceeding five (5) gallons, if liquid, or 
twenty-five (25) pounds if solid, are prohibited in Zones 1, 2, and 3 except as provided under the 
operating conditions provisions of this division. 
(2) ?Operating conditions. Any nonresidential activity within Zone 2 or Zone 3 that desires to store, 
handle, use, or produce any regulated substance in the threshold quantities set forth 
hereinabove shall apply to the city for approval to operate. Such application shall be submitted 
to the city and reviewed by the seacoast utility authority (SUA). Subsequent to SUA's review, 
the city may approve, deny, or approve with conditions any application submitted pursuant to 
this division. The following is a list of operating conditions that may be imposed in order to 
receive approval: 
a. ?Containment of regulated substances. Leak-proof trays under containers, floor curbing or 
other containment systems to provide secondary liquid containment shall be installed. The 
containment shall be of adequate size to handle all spills, leaks, overflows, and 
precipitation until appropriate action can be taken. The specific design and selection of 
materials shall be sufficient to preclude any regulated substance loss to the external 
environment. Containment systems shall be sheltered so that the intrusion of precipitation 
is effectively prevented. The owner/operator may choose to provide adequate and 
appropriate liquid collection methods rather than sheltering only after approval of the 
design by SUA. These requirements shall apply to all areas of use, production, and 
handling, to all storage areas, to loading and off-loading areas, and to above-ground and 
underground storage areas. The containment devices and liquid collection systems shall 
be certified in the operating approval application by a professional engineer or professional 
geologist registered or licensed in the State of Florida. 
b. ?Emergency collection devices. Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials, or 
other devices approved by the Palm Beach County Department of Environmental 
Resources (ERM) shall be present on site or available within two (2) hours by contract with 
a cleanup company approved by ERM, in sufficient magnitude so as to control and collect 
the total quantity of regulated substances present. To the degree feasible, emergency 
containers shall be present and of such capacity as to hold the total quantity of regulated 
substances plus absorbent material. The presence of such emergency collection devices 
shall be certified in the operating application for new activities prior to the presence of 
regulated substances on the site. Certification shall be provided by a professional engineer 
or professional geologist registered or licensed in the State of Florida. 
c. ?Emergency plan. An emergency plan shall be prepared and filed with the operating 
approval application indicating the procedures which will be followed in the event of 
spillage of a regulated substance so as to control and collect all such spilled material in 
such a manner as to prevent it from reaching any storm or sanitary drains or the ground. 
d. ?Inspection. A responsible person designated by the operator who stores, handles, uses, or 
produces the regulated substances shall check on every day of operation for breakage or 
leakage of any container holding the regulated substances. Electronic sensing devices 
may be employed as part of the inspection process, if approved by the city, and provided 
the sensing system is checked daily for malfunctions. The manner of daily inspection shall 
not necessarily require physical inspection of each container provided the location of the 
containers can be inspected to a degree which reasonably assures the city and SUA that 
breakage or leakage can be detected by the inspection. Monitoring records shall be kept 
and made available to the city and/or SUA at all reasonable times for examination. 
e. ?Proper and adequate maintenance of containment and emergency equipment. Procedures 
shall be established for quarterly, in-house inspection and maintenance of containment and 
emergency equipment. Such procedure shall be in writing; a regular checklist and schedule 
of maintenance shall be established; and a log shall be kept of inspections and 
maintenance. Such logs and records shall be available for inspection by the city and SUA. 
f. ?Reporting of spills. Any spill of a regulated substance in excess of the non-aggregate 
quantity thresholds identified in the definition of "regulated substance" shall be reported by 
telephone to Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) and SUA within one (1) 
hour and to the city within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall 
commence immediately upon discovery of the spill. A full written report, including the steps 
taken to contain and clean up the spill, shall be submitted to SUA and the city within fifteen 
(15) days of discovery of the spill. 
g. ?Monitoring for regulated substances in the potable water wells. Arrangements shall be 
made with SUA to establish a semi-annual schedule of raw water analysis unless sampling 
results indicate contamination, in which case the city, upon the recommendation of SUA, 
may require an increased sampling schedule. The analysis shall be for all substances 
which are listed on the operating approval. The analytical reports shall be prepared by a 
State of Florida certified laboratory, certified for the applicable analyses. It shall be the 
responsibility of SUA to provide for the sampling and analyses but the cost shall be borne 
by the operator or those operators on a pro-rata basis as to the same substances listed on 
the approvals of those operators in zones of influence of the subject well. Samples shall be 
taken by the State of Florida certified laboratory performing the analyses, or its authorized 
representative. Semi-annual reports prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory of 
the analyses for regulated substances shall be submitted to SUA for the purpose of 
determining the presence of regulated substances in each well for which a Zones of 
Influence map has been established. 
h. ?Regulated substances in groundwater monitoring wells. Groundwater monitoring well(s) 
shall be provided at the expense of the operator in a manner, number, and location 
approved by the City, upon the recommendation of SUA. Except for existing wells found by 
SUA to be adequate for this provision, the required well or wells shall be installed by a 
State of Florida licensed water well contractor. Samples shall be taken by the State of 
Florida certified laboratory performing the analyses, or its authorized representative. 
Analytical reports prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory of the quantity present 
in each monitoring well of the regulated substances listed in the activity's operating 
approval shall be filed at least semi-annually, or more frequently as determined by the city,

Sec. 78-154. - PUDPlanned unit development overlay district. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. The PUD planned unit development overlay district is established to permit and 
encourage more efficient and creative development or redevelopment of property; to encourage an 
economical and efficient arrangement of buildings; to provide maximum opportunity for application of 
innovative concepts of development in the creation of aesthetically-pleasing living, shopping and 
working environments on properties of adequate size, shape and location; to preserve the natural 
amenities and environmental assets of the land by encouraging the preservation and improvement of 
scenic and functional open areas; to provide architectural and design features which are 
aesthetically pleasing and supportive of an enhanced quality of life; provide one or more specifically-
identifiable benefits to city residents; and to ensure that development occurs according to limitations 
of use, design, density, coverage, and planning as stipulated in an approved development plan. The 
PUD district is a flexible zoning district which is intended to provide an appropriate balance between 
the intensity of development and the ability to provide adequate capacity within the support service 
and facilities. 
(b) ?Land use. A PUD may be considered residential, commercial, professional office, industrial, or 
mixed use, dependent upon the underlying future land use plan designation. 
(c) ?Zoning. Property shall be rezoned to both an underlying zoning district and a planned unit 
development overlay district. The underlying zoning district designation shall be consistent with the 
comprehensive plan. The PUD shall be developed consistent with the uses, property development 
regulations, and other standards applicable to the underlying zoning district. However, the city 
council may, as part of an overall PUD development order, establish use, property development, and 
similar regulations for a specific PUD. In that event, the requirements of the development order shall 
prevail over the underlying zoning district designation. 
(d) ?PGA Boulevard. All development along the PGA Boulevard corridor shall be rezoned to PUD or 
PCD, consistent with the PGA Boulevard corridor overlay zone of division 2 of article V. 
(e) ?Permitted uses. Unless otherwise established by a PUD development order, the uses permitted in 
the PUD district shall be governed by the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
(f) ?Unified control. All land included within a PCD or PUD shall be owned or under the control of the 
applicant. The applicant shall document unified control of the entire area within the proposed PUD. 
The applicant shall agree that the PUD will be developed in accordance with the master 
development plan approved by the city. 
(g) ?Density. The density permitted in a PUD district shall not exceed the allowable density permitted in 
the comprehensive plan. Residential densities permitted in a PUD shall comply with the standards 
provided below. 
(1) ?Residential PUD. Residential PUDs may comprise a mixture of residential dwelling unit types, 
limited to the maximum density indicated in Table 13.

Note: 
(1) ?Density categories as established by comprehensive plan. 
(2) ?Density bonus. In high density residential land use areas, as designated in the comprehensive 
plan, the city council may approve a density bonus of up to 3.0 dwelling units per acre in PUDs. 
The density bonus may be allowed in development order applications which propose to 
construct affordable housing as defined in the city's comprehensive plan. The city council may 
allow an increase in the total gross density for PUDs to an absolute maximum of 15.0 dwelling 
units per acre. However, in no case shall the net density exceed 15.0 dwelling units per acre. 
Net density shall be defined as the total number of dwelling units divided by the total number of 
acres in the site plan. 
(3) ?Commercial development in residential PUDs. 
a. ?Limit. Not more than three percent of the gross land area of a residential PUD may be 
developed for development-serving commercial or office uses. Uses in residential PUD 
commercial areas shall be same as the permitted or conditional uses in the CN zoning 
district. 
b. ?Building permits. Building permits shall not be issued for construction of any portion of a 
commercial structure in a residential PUD until at least 25 percent of the total number of 
dwelling units within the PUD are under construction. An applicant may request a waiver to 
reduce the required threshold for dwelling units under construction. 
c. ?Location. Commercial development in residential PUDs shall be constructed in one or more 
locations that optimize availability to residents of the PUD. Commercial developments 
within a PUD shall be designated on the PUD master plan. The location of the commercial 
development is subject to the overall standards listed below. 
1. ?The size, intensity, and proposed uses within the proposed commercial development 
are appropriate as PUD-serving uses, and are not of a nature requiring a larger 
market area. 
2. ?The proposed commercial development may contain civic uses of a PUD-serving 
nature, including postal services, meeting facilities, recreation facilities, and

(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 88, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 8-2003, § 2, 6-5-03; Ord. No. 16, 2014, § 2, 11-6-14) 


Sec. 78-155. - PCDPlanned community development overlay district (PCD). 
(a) ?Composition and intent. The PCD overlay district is composed of large tracts of land which are 
planned to function as a relatively self-contained and identifiable district, section, or neighborhood 
community of the city. It is the intent of the district regulations to encourage ingenuity and 
imagination in the planning and development or redevelopment of suitable tracts of land large 
enough to accommodate the various uses and activities associated with a planned community and to 
permit a large area to be developed under one master plan that includes a mix of land use types at 
different levels of intensity. The PCD overlay district also is intended to encourage the use of 
architectural and design features which are aesthetically pleasing and supportive of an enhanced 
quality of life. The PCD overlay district also is intended for development to occur in a manner that 
provides one or more specifically identifiable benefits to city residents. 
(b) ?Land use. A PCD may be considered for residential, commercial, professional office, or industrial 
use, dependent upon the underlying future land use designation. 
(c) ?Zoning. Property shall be rezoned to a single underlying zoning district and a planned community 
district overlay district. The underlying zoning district designation shall be consistent with the 
comprehensive plan. The PCD shall be developed consistent with the uses, property development 
regulations, and other standards applicable to the underlying zoning district. However, the city 
council may, as part of an overall PCD development order, establish use, property development, and 
similar regulations for a specific PCD. In that event, the requirements of the development order shall 
prevail over the requirements of the underlying zoning district designation. In the event the proposed 
development of a site within a PCD is not consistent with or comparable to the nature of the 
underlying zoning district, such as the commercial portion of a residential PCD, the procedure 
outlined below shall apply. 
(1) ?Application. The application for site plan approval shall include the following: 
a. ?The zoning district most comparable to the proposed site development; and 
b. ?Waivers necessary to implement the site plan, based upon the most comparable zoning 
district. 
(2) ?Growth management director. The growth management director shall determine the zoning 
district to be utilized for comparison purposes. The determination shall include the factors listed 
below. 
a. ?The zoning district most comparable to the proposed project, in order to reduce the number 
of waivers that may be necessary for overall site development. 
b. ?The zoning district most comparable to the overall residential density or nonresidential 
intensity of the proposed development. 
c. ?The zoning district with the property development regulations that are most comparable to 
the proposed project. 
(3) ?Waivers. The determination of the most comparable zoning district by the growth management 
director may include any additional waivers identified by the city staff that may be necessary for 
project approval. 
(d) ?Phased development. Based upon an approved master development plan, the district may be 
developed in phases, pursuant to the site plan review procedures set out in this chapter and 
consistent with the approved master development plan. 
(e) ?Permitted uses. Unless otherwise established by a PCD development order, the uses permitted in 
the PCD district shall be governed by the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district. The 
density permitted in a PCD shall not exceed the allowable density permitted in the comprehensive 
plan, based upon the standards listed below. 
(1) ?Residential. Some mixtures of residential types of dwelling units are permitted and encouraged, 
limited to the maximum density indicated in Table 15.

(1)?Density categories as established by comprehensive plan. 
(2) ?Conditional uses. Unless otherwise limited by a development order, all conditional uses within 
a PCD shall be allowed pursuant to the conditional use regulations of section 78-43. Site plan 
development of a conditional use within a PCD shall be subject to the requirements of section 
78-48. 
(f) ?Preservation of native ecological habitats in RH districts. In addition to the requirements of division 4 
of article V, PCDs with an underlying future land use designation of RH may have densities permitted 
up to 15.0 units per gross acre if large contiguous areas of native ecological habitats are preserved. 
These preserve areas exceed any minimum preservation and open space areas provided in 
accordance with standard PCD requirements. 
(g) ?Density bonus. In high density residential land use areas, as designated in the comprehensive plan, 
the city council may approve a density bonus of up to 3.0 dwelling units per acre in PCDs. The 
density bonus may be allowed in development order applications which propose to construct 
affordable housing as defined in the city's comprehensive plan. The city council may allow an 
increase in the total gross density for PCDs to an absolute maximum 15.0 dwelling units per acre. 
However, in no case shall the net density exceed 15.0 dwelling units per acre. Net density shall be 
defined as the total number of dwelling units divided by the total number of acres in the site plan. 
(h) ?Commercial and industrial uses in residential districts. A PCD with an underlying residential future 
land use plan designation may include up to three percent of the gross land of a residential planned 
community district for commercial or office use, and up to two percent for industrial use. Uses 
permitted in such areas shall be established within the development order approved by the city 
council. 
(i) ?Preservation of native ecological habitats for commercial uses. Up to five percent of the gross land 
area of a residential PCD may be developed for commercial or office use if at least ten percent of the 
total area of native ecological habitats is preserved. This preservation area shall be in addition to 
preserve areas required by division 4 of article V. 
(j) ?Mixed use PCD. 
(1) ?Mixed uses. PCDs with an underlying mixed use future land use plan designation may be 
approved by the city council. Mixed use PCDs shall include a minimum of three types of land 
uses and shall be planned for a diversification of uses, structures, and open spaces in a manner 
compatible with surrounding land uses and development patterns. A single use shall not occupy 
more than 60 percent of the site area proposed for a mixed use PCD. 
(2) ?Specific requirements. Requirements applicable to mixed use PCDs are established in section 
78-157. 
(k) ?Commercial recreation PCD. PCDs with an underlying commercial recreation future land use plan 
designation shall be designed to accommodate major public and private commercial recreation 
facilities. Uses permitted within this category include golf courses; outdoor and indoor recreational 
facilities such as tennis clubs, and amusement and sport centers; outdoor amphitheaters; hunting 
and gun clubs; and outdoor wildlife attractions. Rural residential uses at a density of one dwelling 
unit per ten acres are also permitted within this category. 
(l) ?PGA Boulevard corridor. Consistent with the PGA Boulevard planning and design regulations, all 
development along the PGA Boulevard corridor shall be restricted to promote and preserve the 
character of the corridor. The uses prohibited in the PGA Boulevard corridor overlay, as provided in 
division 2 of article V may not be waived by the city council. 
(m) ?Development area. Minimum development sizes for PCDs are established in Table 16.

Notes: 
(1) ?Lot coverage requirement is parcel-based, dependent on the specific land-use proposal. 
(2) ?Neighborhood commercial parcels shall be used for community-serving retail, service, office, 
and business uses. 
(3) ?The minimum requirement for residential high land use as determined by Table 18, shall be 
located above the ground floor of a nonresidential use. The city council may waive the vertical 
integration requirement upon consideration of a recommendation by the planning, zoning, and 
appeals board. Residential high parcels shall have a maximum density of 15 units per acre as a 
bonus for implementation of planned, and vertically and horizontally integrated development. 
The area allocated for both residential low and residential high land uses shall not exceed the 
60 percent maximum in this table. Density shall be consistent with the requirements of the 
comprehensive plan and this chapter. 
(4) ?Employment center parcels shall be used for corporate offices, research and educational 
facilities, light industry, hotels, warehousing, and similar uses. Employment Center lots 
generally shall be grouped together. 
(g) ?Nonresidential MXD PCD/PUD intensity measures. Nonresidential MXD PCD/PUDs shall, unless 
waived by the city council, be consistent with section 78-158 and comply with the intensity measure 
indicated in Table 19. 
(1) ?Nonresidential criteria. The mandatory residential requirement of MXD developments may be 
waived by the city council if the development order application complies with any two of the 
criteria listed below: 
a. ?The parcel represents infill development and is surrounded on at least three sides by 
nonresidential land uses, including manmade and natural barriers such as canals, railroad 
tracks, and major arterial roadways. 
b. ?The density or intensity of existing or future land uses immediately surrounding the parcels 
are compatible with nonresidential uses. 
c. ?The surrounding existing, or planned and approved built environment is at least 60 percent 
residential, and nonresidential uses are determined to provide for such benefits as greater 
horizontal integration of uses. The measurement shall be determined on a lineal basis, as 
measured around the perimeter of the affected property. 
d. ?The potential for providing an economically feasible and integrated residential component 
that enhances and is complementary to other MXD uses is limited by the size of a parcel 
and the overall site configuration.

(6) ?Outdoor lighting for city public facilities and sport facilities such as tennis courts, stadiums, 
soccer and ball fields are exempt from the foot-candle standards in Table 1; however, lighting at 
sports facilities shall not exceed IESNA-recommended practices for the type of field and use, 
and shall meet standards for light spillover and glare for residential properties in this section. 
(7) ?In those areas designated as recreational areas, or within preserves, pedestrian paths or multi-
purpose paths, or other areas that are either gated or secured or are closed after dusk, lighting 
requirements shall be determined, as part of a development order approval, by the growth 
management director with mandatory consultation with the police department in order to provide

downward and shall be fully recessed or fully shielded so as to ensure that the light fixture is not 
visible from public rights-of-way or adjacent properties and does not cause glare. All light 
emitted by an under-canopy fixture shall be substantially confined to the ground surface directly 
beneath the perimeter of the canopy. As an alternative to recessed lighting, indirect lighting may 
be used when light is directed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the 
canopy. In this case, light fixtures shall be shielded so that direct illumination is focused 
exclusively on the underside of the canopy. No lighting shall be permitted on the top or sides of 
the canopy, excluding internally-illuminated signs. 
(5) ?Flag poles. A flag pole may be illuminated by fully-shielded spotlight light fixture or fixtures 
which shall not create off-site glare or light spillover above the limits established in Table 1. The 
light fixture(s) shall be placed as close to the base of the flag pole as possible. 
(6) ?Maintenance. Fixtures and lighting systems used for safety and security shall be in good 
working order and shall be maintained in a manner that serves the original intent of the system 
at all times. Accent and building lighting shall be maintained to keep the desired aesthetic 
appearance. 
(d) ?Building and accent lighting. 
(1) ?Lighting of buildings. All exterior lighting of buildings, including entry, facade, security, and

and compatible with the overall surroundings. 
b. ?Compatibility. Lighting shall be installed in a manner that is compatible with the 
neighborhood and adjacent development. 
c. ?Fixtures. All fixtures used in exterior building lighting are to be selected for functional and 
aesthetic value. Light fixtures shall not be directly beamed toward adjacent properties and 
pedestrian areas. 
d. ?Accent lighting for nonresidential, multi-family, and mixed-use buildings. Accent lighting of 
a building facade for architectural, aesthetic, or decorative purposes is permitted subject to 
the following restrictions: 
1. ?All upward-aimed lights shall be fully shielded from projecting into the sky by eaves, 
roofs, or overhangs. 
2. ?Strings of lights or other similar accent lighting may be installed on trees and 
landscaping and on buildings below the roofline provided: 
i. ?Strings of lights shall not be suspended horizontally between any buildings, walls, 
fences, trees, or shrubs.

permitted from November 1 through January 31. 
(f) ?Lighting plans. Plans for illumination of buildings and lighting zones shall be submitted at the time a 
building permit is submitted or as otherwise required herein. Lighting plans shall comply with the 
standards listed below: 
(1) ?Design. Plans shall be prepared and sealed by an engineer registered in the State of Florida. 
(2) ?Plans. Lighting plan or plans, including photometric plans, shall include the following 
information: 
a. ?Overall site plan. 
b. ?Vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation. 
c. ?Location of parking stalls. 
d. ?Adjacent property lines, including existing uses and future land use map and zoning district 
designations.

registered professional architect or engineer has been provided stating that the installation 
has been field checked and meets the specification set forth on the approved photometric 
plan. 
(g) ?Method of measurement. The light meter sensor shall be read at ground level or the established 
grade in a horizontal position. Readings shall be taken only after the light source has been exposed 
long enough to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be taken after dark with the light 
sources to be measured on and subsequently off. The difference of the two readings shall be 
compared to the permitted illumination level for each lighting zone. 
(h) ?Security lighting. In order to utilize crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) 
principles, security lighting shall be required on all nonresidential, multi-family residential, and mixed-
use developments and in certain common areas of single-family developments. Security lighting may 
not produce glare or off-site light spillover above the maximum limits set forth in Table 1. 
(1) ?Open parking lots, parking garages, loading zones, and access roads and paths in 
nonresidential, multi-family residential, and mixed-use developments shall maintain a lighting 
level at least 50 percent of the minimum average lighting requirements set forth in Table 1 from 
dusk to dawn or outside of normal business hours.

DIVISION 2. - PGA BOULEVARD CORRIDOR OVERLAY 


Sec. 78-221. - PGA Boulevard corridor overlay. 
(a) ?Scope. The planning and design regulations established in this division shall apply to all lands within 
the PGA Boulevard corridor overlay. 
(b) ?Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this division is provided below. 
(1) ?Main Street character. The character, magnitude, aesthetics, and uses to be developed or 
redeveloped on PGA Boulevard are of special interest to the city because it is the city's "Main 
Street." Accordingly, the purpose and intent of this division is to implement policies regarding 
the PGA Boulevard corridor as recognized by the city's comprehensive plan. Policy 1.1.6.5 of 
the city's comprehensive plan states that PGA Boulevard shall be developed using the 
techniques indicated below. 
a. ?Following completion of the PGA Boulevard/Alternate A1A urban interchange, a new 
CRALLS (Constrained Road way at a Lower Level of Service) level of service standard for 
PGA Boulevard shall be determined in coordination with the county, the regional planning 
council and the state department of transportation, with the maximum number of lanes 
being six. 
b. ?The city shall maintain the PGA design guidelines as regulations which require utilization of 
landscaping, boulevard strips, pedestrian walkways, bikeways, buffers, and setbacks to 
emphasize the various functions of PGA Boulevard as a divider of different land uses and 
as a center of the city. 
(2) ?Planning and design guidelines. The city seeks to encourage the development of specific 
commercial retail and office uses along PGA Boulevard because it is the city's "Main Street." 
Because the PGA Boulevard corridor acts as a divider between land uses, it is necessary that 
the city ensure that adequate buffering is provided along this corridor in a consistent manner. In 
recognition of the city's desire to create special character and aesthetics for this corridor, 
planning and design guidelines and particular uses are established for the PGA Boulevard 
corridor. The planning and design guidelines are intended to achieve the objectives listed 
below. 
a. ?Create a special identity for PGA Boulevard through the use of planning and design 
standards. 
b. ?Ensure high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development along 
the corridor 
c. ?Regulate uses within the corridor which will create a specific character and aesthetic quality 
for the corridor. 
d. ?Ensure that new development or redevelopment projects preserve and enhance the 
existing visual character of the corridor. 
e. ?Promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
(3) ?Use regulations. The use regulations in this division are intended to create an urban 
environment that displays the highest quality private and public-sector development. Further, 
innovative and alternative provisions which lend a sense of integration and connection to the 
properties along the corridor shall be encouraged. 
(4) ?Waivers. The city shall not grant any waiver which permits the establishment of a use not 
authorized by this division. The city shall not grant any waiver of intensity which would allow a 
theater in excess of 500 seats. 
(c) ?Applicability and effects. 
(1) ?Applicability. 
a. ?Standards. The standards contained in this division shall apply to all property which fronts 
upon or is considered by the city to be functionally oriented to PGA Boulevard. These 
standards may apply regardless of whether or not a property is primarily accessed via PGA 
Boulevard or where property may not be accessible via PGA Boulevard. 
b. ?Existing approvals. While existing development and approvals granted prior to August 18, 
1994, are not required to comply with the standards of this division, any major 
amendments to previous approvals, or any redevelopment shall conform with these 
regulations. 
c. ?Affect on nonconformities. Nonconforming buildings, lots, or uses shall be subject to the 
provisions of the overlay should they seek any expansion or modification, or should they 
suffer damage in excess of 50 percent of their appraised value. 
(2) ?Boundaries. The PGA Boulevard corridor overlay consists of those lands fronting or abutting 
PGA Boulevard, including access drives, for a depth of 1,000 feet from the edge of right-of-way, 
within the city limits. If a PUD fronts or abuts PGA Boulevard and any portion is within 1,000 feet 
from the edge of right-of-way, then all parcels within said PUD shall be included in the overlay 
regardless of property depth. All nonresidential components of a PCD that front or abut PGA 
Boulevard shall be included within the boundaries of the PGA Boulevard Corridor Overlay 
regardless of the depth of the parcel. 
(3) ?Conflicts. To the extent that any conflicts occur between the standards of the overlay and this 
chapter or other regulations, the provisions of the overlay shall prevail. Additionally, where 
provisions of this overlay are not in conflict with other regulations, that which is more strict shall 
prevail. 
(d) ?Site development guidelines. 
(1) ?District uses.

vegetation shall be protected by the developer's implementation of best management 
practices consistent with divisions 4 and 7 of article V. Drainage or elevation changes 
occurring during infrastructure installation shall not adversely impact tree preservation. The 
greenbelt of the PGA Boulevard corridor can be a relocation site for trees and other plants 
being moved from adjacent development. After construction, emphasis shall be placed on 
the replacement of dead and unhealthy trees and plants to ensure in perpetuity that a 
substantial tree canopy remains. 
c. ?Tree credits. Trees which have been preserved within the PGA Boulevard corridor shall not 
be credited toward meeting the city's environmental preservation requirements unless 
approved for credit by the growth management director, consistent with the standards of 
section 78-250. Retention and detention drainage and stormwater control facilities shall not 
be located within the landscape/buffer areas of the PGA Boulevard corridor. Existing 
natural vegetation shall be maintained or managed with the same standards set for new 
landscaping. The requirement of 100 percent irrigation may be waived by the city council

list: live oak, slash pine, saw palmetto, wax myrtle, sabal palm, common grasses, and other 
materials approved by the department. 
(3) ?Design. Free form design means new trees and shrubs should duplicate natural patterns with 
multiple plant sizes, spacing, plant clusters, and single plantings. Grass shall be planted in all 
open areas. Mulch shall be used around all trees and plants. The greenbelt shall have 
undulating berms, located generally along rights-of-way. Windows or voids in the landscaping, if 
not in excess of 60 feet, are acceptable for scenic views of lakes, art in public places, or 
signage. Nonmountable curbs shall be used to ensure the installation and preservation of 
landscape materials by separating landscape materials from roads or vehicular circulation 
areas. 
(4) ?Materials and installation. All trees, plants and any other associated landscape or outdoor 
material shall be of Florida No. 1, or better, as classified by the Florida Department of 
Agriculture and Consumer Services. All new landscaping shall be 100 percent irrigated. The 
water source for irrigation shall be approved by the city prior to installation. All backflow 
preventers, electrical boxes, lift stations and any other utility structure shall be screened with 
landscaping. Intersections, entrances, and building frontage can be enhanced with additional 
landscaping not listed in this subsection with site plan approval. 
(5) ?Pathways and sidewalks. Multiuse pathways and sidewalks shall meander around vegetation 
and berms throughout the greenbelt. However, sidewalks shall be setback at least ten feet from 
the exterior edge of curbing or paving, as determined by the growth management director. 
Nature trails may connect to the sidewalks. Pathways shall be illuminated pursuant to 
specifications approved during site plan approval. All landscaping, irrigation, berms, sidewalks, 
and lighting within road rights-of-way shall be approved by the appropriate jurisdiction. 
(6) ?Maintenance. The responsibility for and cost of maintenance of the greenbelt, including right-of-
way and medians, and buffer areas, shall be the responsibility of the fronting property owner 
unless otherwise determined prior to site plan approval. 
(7) ?Corridor landscaping theme. The conceptual landscaping theme is illustrated in Figure 2. 
Additional intersection/entrance landscaping, which is required consistent with division 7 of 
article V, also shall be installed. 
 
Figure 2 
(8) ?Berms. Berming and mounding of the site shall utilize long and gentle slopes. As a rule, the 
higher the berm, the gentler the slope shall be. Berms five feet or less in height shall have a 
maximum slope of 2:1. Berms greater that five feet in height shall not exceed 3:1 in slope. 
(9) ?Fences and walls. Fences and walls shall not be visible from any public rights-of-way. All 
fences and walls shall be screened with vegetation from public view.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 30-2002, § 2, adopted Sept. 4, 2002, provided for the inclusion of a new ch. 78, 
art. V, div. 3 to read as herein set out. All subsequent divisions of article V, being divs. 313, have been 
renumbered as divs. 414. See the Code Comparative Table. 


Sec. 78-225. - General provisions. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the Northlake Boulevard Overlay Zoning District 
(NBOZ) is to implement the objectives of the Northlake Boulevard Corridor Conceptual Streetscape 
Plan adopted by the Northlake Boulevard Corridor Task Force. These objectives include: 
(1) ?Redevelopment of the corridor in order to build community pride, retain and attract commercial 
activity, and improve the area's economic condition. 
(2) ?Reinforcement of the unique opportunities and long-term stability of the corridor by the 
implementation of urban design guidelines for future development. 
(3) ?Improvement of signage along the corridor. 
(4) ?Initiation of design improvements for the community through the implementation of the 
proposed design guidelines. 
(5) ?Development of a unifying community design and development theme to work in conjunction 
with the proposed corridor streetscaping. 
(6) ?Preparation of development regulations to enable refurbishment of properties within the 
corridor. 
(7) ?Creation of the opportunity for new development to respect existing scale, style, and character, 
while preserving the positive aspects of the corridor. 
(b) ?Scope. 
(1) ?Boundaries. The NBOZ includes the public right-of-way for Northlake Boulevard and all 
properties along Northlake Boulevard from Military Trail to U.S. Highway One for one property 
depth north and south of Northlake Boulevard, including the street intersection properties at 
U.S. Highway One and at Military Trail. The NBOZ encompasses approximately three and one-
third miles. 
a. ?Lake Park. Incorporated portions of the Northlake Boulevard corridor include portions of 
Section 20, Township 42, Range 43; Section 21, Township 42, Range 43; Section 17, 
Township 42, Range 42; and Section 19, Township 42, Range 43 as indicated on the 
official zoning map. 
b. ?North Palm Beach. Incorporated portions of the Northlake Boulevard corridor include 
portions of Section 16, Township 42, Range 43; Section 21, Township 42, Range 43; and 
Section 17, Township 42, Range 43 as indicated on the official zoning map. 
c. ?Palm Beach County. Unincorporated portions of the Northlake Boulevard corridor include 
portions of Section 18, Township 42, Range 43; Section 17, Township 42, Range 43; 
Section 24, Township 42, Range 42; and Section 19, Township 42, Range 43 as indicated 
on the official zoning map. 
d. ?Palm Beach Gardens. Incorporated portions of the Northlake Boulevard corridor include 
portions of Section 18, Township 42, Range 43; Section 13, Township 42, Range 42; 
Section 24, Township 42, Range 42; and Section 19, Township 42, Range 43 as indicated 
on the official zoning map. 
(2) ?Districts. Because Northlake Boulevard was developed at different times and under varying 
jurisdictions, the commercial intensity, layout and physical characteristics of the structures differ 
from one area to the next. Therefore, the overlay has been divided into three districts, which 
reflect these differences. The east, west and central districts were created to regulate the type 
of uses permitted in each district. The east and west districts are neighborhood serving, while 
the central district services the region. The physical boundaries of these districts are as follows: 
a. ?West: From Military Trail to Interstate 95. 
b. ?Central: From Interstate 95 to Alternate A1A (north side) and Prosperity Farms Road 
(south side). 
c. ?East: From Alternate A1A (north side) and Prosperity Farms Road (south side) to U.S. 
Highway One. 
(3) ?Minimum requirements. The following provisions of the NBOZ district are the minimum 
requirements necessary to accomplish the purposes of the NBOZ and implement and ensure 
consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. Development shall not be undertaken without prior 
authorization pursuant to the NBOZ. 
(c) ?Applicability. 
(1) ?Applicability. The provisions of the NBOZ district shall apply to all existing and future 
development within the boundaries of the NBOZ district as follows: 
a. ?All new development. 
b. ?All renovations, additions, or redevelopment to existing structures where the cost of such is 
GREATER than 50 percent of the assessed improvement value of the parcel, indicated on 
the most recent tax roll of Palm Beach County Property Appraiser, or an increase of 
greater than 20 percent of the square footage of the existing structure shall conform to 100 
percent of the NBOZ regulations. 
c. ?When the use of an existing structure ceases for 180 consecutive days, or as otherwise 
determined to be a discontinued or abandoned use by the local zoning code. 
(2) ?Invalid approvals. Invalid development orders or permits of projects, which have been revoked 
or have expired shall be subject to all applicable provisions of the NBOZ. 
(3) ?Conflict with other applicable regulations. 
a. ?When the provisions of the NBOZ district conflict with other jurisdictional regulations 
applicable to the site, the most restrictive provisions shall prevail. 
b. ?Provisions addressed within the individual jurisdiction regulations that are not addressed 
within the NBOZ district remain applicable in the development or redevelopment of a site in 
the NBOZ. 
(d) ?Procedure and regulations. 
(1) ?Submittal procedure. Development or redevelopment within the Corridor shall adhere to the 
regulations imposed by the NBOZ district. Compliance with the standards of the NBOZ shall be 
demonstrated by submittal of architectural drawings and a site development plan or site 
improvement plan in accordance with the governing jurisdiction. The development order shall 
reflect the restrictions imposed by the NBOZ. 
(2) ?Use regulations. Restrictions which may be imposed in the NBOZ district shall be limited to the 
following: 
a. ?Reducing the number of land uses permitted by right and permitted by conditional use 
within the NBOZ; 
b. ?Eliminating inappropriate land use within the NBOZ; 
c. ?Limiting maximum building or impervious coverage permitted; 
d. ?Management of access to abutting and nearby roadways, including specific design features 
intended to reduce adverse traffic impacts; or 
e. ?Any other specific site development regulations required or authorized by these provisions. 
(3) ?Review procedures. Unless otherwise stated within these provisions, the review procedures for 
development and redevelopment of applicable sites within the NBOZ district shall be pursuant 
to the governing jurisdiction's review procedures and approval process. 
(4) ?Waivers and variances. Waivers and variances from the NBOZ regulations may be granted by 
the individual jurisdiction reviewing projects which are subject to the NBOZ regulations. 
a. ?Waivers from the NBOZ regulations may be granted by the applicable reviewing jurisdiction 
in accordance with the applicable jurisdiction's procedures for granting waivers from its 
own code. 
b. ?Variances may be granted by the applicable reviewing jurisdiction using the same 
procedures, which the applicable jurisdiction uses in granting variances from its own code. 
(Ord. No. 30-2002, § 2(Exh. A, §§ 1-11-4), 9-4-02) 


Sec. 78-226. - Zoning regulations. 
(a) ?Development review regulations. 
(1) ?Conditional use and special permit use. Conditional use and special permit use are generally 
compatible with the other uses permitted in the district, but which require individual review as to 
their location, design, configuration, intensity and/or density of use, buildings and structures, 
and may require the imposition of conditions in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use 
at a particular location. The supplemental regulations outlined in subsection 78-226(c) of this 
division are to be considered in addition to the existing jurisdiction standards, however the most 
restrictive regulations apply. These uses may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied 
after review by the appropriate reviewing agency or board, in accord with the procedures, 
standards, and limitations of the applicable codes. Special permit uses are generally temporary 
for a specified fixed period of time. 
(2) ?Prohibited uses. Uses not listed in the use chart are prohibited unless it is determined by the 
jurisdiction in accordance with the customary procedures utilized by the jurisdiction that the 
requested use is similar in nature to a listed use and not contrary to the intent of the NBOZ. 
(3) ?Existing planned development districts. Properties within the jurisdiction of the municipalities, 
which have a PUD or PCD designation at the time of adoption of the NBOZ, shall be permitted 
to have uses and design guidelines in accordance with the development order for that planned 
development district so long as the development order is in affect. Any amendment to the PUD 
will have to comply with the design guidelines of the NBOZ. 
(4) ?Variances. A variance from the supplementary use standards established in this division shall 
not be granted by the affected jurisdiction. 
(5) ?Accessory use. An accessory use is customarily associated with the principal use, incidental to 
the principal use, and subordinate in area, extent or purpose, and serves only the principal use. 
Accessory uses shall be subject to the following: 
a. ?All accessory uses shall be located on the same lot as the principal use. 
b. ?A use that is an accessory to a nonresidential principal use shall not exceed 30 percent of 
the floor area or business receipts of the principal use. 
(6) ?Parking and loading. All parking and loading standards are governed by the appropriate 
jurisdiction. 
(7) ?Measuring distances. All required distances between structures and/or uses within this division 
shall be measured and determined irrespective of existing municipal boundaries. 
(b) ?Land use chart.

d. ?Numerals shall be affixed at center or on either end of the building and clearly visible from 
the street. Multi-unit buildings, in addition, shall have numerical or letter unit designations 
clearly visible from the street. 
e. ?All street numbers shall be a contrasting color with the building or background field. 
(2) ?Multi-unit buildings, two stories and up. In multi-unit buildings, two stories and up, directional 
unit identification signs shall be posted outside of each elevator and stairwell. This will apply 
only when there is an option for direction of travel. 
(3) ?Additional posting. All multi-unit buildings that can be accessed from the rear, shall have the 
address and unit numbers posted at the rear of the building. When property layout, landscaping, 
or driveway design limits the visibility of the address, additional signs shall be posted to identify 
buildings or direction of travel to reach buildings. 
(h) ?Measurement determinations. 
(1) ?Facade area. The facade area shall be measured by determining the area within a two-
dimensional geometric figure coinciding with the edges of the walls, windows, doors, parapets, 
marquees, and roof slopes of greater than 45 degrees that form a side of a building or unit. 
(2) ?Sign area. The area of a sign shall be the area within the smallest square, rectangle, 
parallelogram, triangle, circle or semicircle, the sides of which touch the extreme points or 
edges of the sign face. 
a. ?Computation of sign area. 
1. ?The area of a sign permissible for each classification of sign, as herein set forth, shall 
include all areas of the sign containing informational and/or directional wording or 
symbols, and shall include background area of the wording or symbols, as measured 
by inscribing a continuous line around all the letters or symbols contained thereon. 
2. ?Sign area for signs not covered by sections herein and except as provided below shall 
be the area of each face of a sign including the area of the smallest circle, triangle or 
parallelogram which contains all content, background and structural elements of the

3. ?Where a sign is composed of letters attached directly to a facade, window, door, or 
marquee, and the letters are not enclosed by a border or trimming, the sign area shall 
be the area within the smallest rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle or semicircle, 
the sides of which touch the extreme points of the letters or pictures. 
b. ?Exempted from computation of area of freestanding signs. The area of each face of a 
freestanding sign shall be computed as described herein except that individual support 
structures shall not be considered to be part of the sign if they: 
1. ?Support structures which are part of a decorative landscape wall or screen wall shall 
not be considered to be part of the sign; and 
2. ?Do not contain letters, symbols or other sign content. 
(3) ?Number of signs. In general, the number of signs shall be the number of non-contiguous sign 
faces. Multiple non-contiguous sign faces may be counted as a single sign if all the sign faces 
are included in the geometric figure used for determining the sign area. 
a. ?Where two sign faces are placed back to back in a single sign structure and are at no point 
more than three feet apart, it shall be counted as one sign. 
b. ?If a sign has four faces arranged in a square, rectangle or diamond, it shall be counted as 
two signs, and shall be the areas of the two largest faces.

Sec. 78-231. - Parkway overlay district. 
(a) ?Scope. The parkway system requirements in this division shall apply to all roadways designated as 
parkways within the comprehensive plan or by the City of Palm Beach Gardens Official Zoning Map. 
(b) ?Parkway system. Objective 2.1.7, and policies 2.1.7.1, 2.1.7.2, and 2.1.7.3 of the city's 
comprehensive plan require the development of a parkway system to provide city residents with an 
alternative mode of transportation which is safe and aesthetic, as well as to beautify the city's 
arteries and protect residential areas from the impacts of highly-traveled arteries. 
(1) ?Parkway objectives. The objectives of the parkway overlay are established to accomplish the 
following: 
a. ?Preserve urban beauty through right-of-way landscaping requirements; 
b. ?Provide residents with a safe and aesthetic multiuse pathway system; 
c. ?Provide a buffer between designated roadways and the adjacent development; 
d. ?Eliminate a perceived need of using strip commercial as a buffer between arterials and 
residential areas; and 
e. ?Promote and protect the peace, health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
(c) ?Standards and waivers. Specific standards have been created for the parkway overlay which are 
intended to provide a buffered multiuse pathway and landscaped roadway system. Although these 
standards are intended as a benchmark for development and shall be applied to the fullest extent 
possible, it is recognized that in some situations it will not be possible to comply with all of the 
standards. Therefore, the physical constraints of a particular site will be considered in determining 
which standards are applicable and the extent of compliance with the specific standards for each 
particular project. The standards may be waived only with the approval of the city council, subject to 
section 78-158. 
(d) ?Applicability and effects. 
(1) ?Applicability. The standards contained in this division shall apply to all roadways designated as 
a parkway by the city council, including all of the following: 
a. ?PGA Boulevard west of Central Boulevard; 
b. ?Central Boulevard; 
c. ?Donald Ross Road; 
d. ?Beeline Highway north of PGA Boulevard; 
e. ?Hood Road west of Central Boulevard; 
f. ?A future (yet unnamed) north-south artery between PGA Boulevard and Hood Road; and 
g. ?A future (yet unnamed) east-west artery between Central Boulevard and the future north-
south artery. 
(2) ?Prior approvals. While existing development and approvals granted prior to August 18, 1994, 
are not affected, major amendments to prior approvals, redevelopment, and new development 
shall conform with the provisions of this overlay. 
(3) ?Conflicts. Where conflicts occur between the standards and requirements of the overlay district, 
this chapter, or other regulations, the provisions of the overlay district shall prevail. Additionally, 
where provisions of this overlay are not in conflict with other regulations, that which is more 
strict shall prevail. 
(e) ?Location. The parkway overlay shall consist of the road segments and dimensions as provided in 
Table 23.

(f) ?Parkway development guidelines. 
(1) ?Parkway concept. 
a. ?Right-of-way and easements. Each parkway shall include a parkway right-of-way and 
easement as described below in conceptual cross sections. Installed within the parkway 
and easement shall be a multiuse pathway, pedestrian path, landscaped medians, linear 
parks, greenbelts and landscaping buffers. Conceptual cross sections of a parkways are 
illustrated in Figures 3 through 12. The city council shall approve the ultimate cross section 
of each parkway link.

b. ?Implementation. Implementation of the parkway concept shall require installation of the 
improvements specified below: 
1. ?Nonmountable curbing, acceptable to the city engineer, to allow landscaping buffers to 
be installed between the roadway and the pedestrian/bicycle pathways; 
2. ?A meandering 12-foot multiuse pathway; 
3. ?A six-foot pedestrian sidewalk on the opposite side of the artery from the pathway; 
4. ?Landscaping of medians; 
5. ?Preservation of native vegetation or installation of landscaping to buffer the artery and 
pathway from adjacent development and to provide a canopy for pedestrians and 
bicyclists; 
6. ?Irrigation, where necessary, to ensure the viability of landscaping; and 
7. ?Dedication of a parkway easement for those areas outside of the formal road right-of-
way but within the 200- to 400-foot parkway. 
c. ?Views. Special views along the road and special public features such as fountains, art in 
public places, and pedestrian parks may also be provided within the parkway with city 
council approval. 
(2) ?Landscape theme. A native pine-oak vegetative community shall constitute the landscaping 
theme of the parkway system. Plantings shall include but not be limited to live oak, slash pine, 
saw palmetto, wax myrtle, sabal palm, as well as grass. Clusters of vegetative communities as 
well as individual trees shall be provided, consistent with clear zone and sight distance criteria, 
in landscape medians to buffer the pathways from the roadway and adjacent land uses, and to 
provide a canopy. 
(3) ?Parkway improvements. 
a. ?All new development fronting along a parkway shall be required to install, develop, or 
otherwise provide for the implementation of the parkway system, as illustrated in the 
conceptual cross sections and described in this division. 
b. ?The city shall coordinate the installation of the parkway system with the development 
approval process. Proposed development fronting along a parkway shall prepare plans for 
the necessary improvements and install the facilities/elements or provide the city with the 
appropriate amount of funds or surety to cover the costs of such improvements. 
c. ?For determination as to whether improvement of the parkway shall be conducted 
concurrent with development, or whether there shall be provision of funding or surety to the 
city in an amount equal to 110 percent of the cost of the needed improvements, the city 
hereby establishes a guideline threshold of one-half mile (2,640 linear feet). 
1. ?Any property possessing at least one-half mile frontage shall install the required 
parkway improvements concurrently with development. 
2. ?Any property possessing less than one-half mile frontage may be required to install 
the improvements concurrently with development, or may be allowed to furnish surety 
as provided herein. 
3. ?If monies in lieu of improvement are provided, the city will install the required 
improvements at a time in the future when a "link" or segment of the parkway can be 
achieved or when roadway improvements or development activities allow 
implementation of the parkway system. 
4. ?The city council shall determine when parkway improvements are to be installed. 
d. ?The one-half-mile threshold is a guideline and shall be used on a case-by-case basis to 
ascertain whether the adjacent land uses or characteristics of the development require or 
warrant installation of the necessary improvements concurrent with development. 
(4) ?Maintenance. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, the owner of the property, or 
successor thereto, with frontage along the parkway shall be responsible for the perpetual 
maintenance and irrigation of the parkway. In like manner, the owner of property with frontage 
along one side of the parkway shall share the responsibility of maintaining that portion of the 
median, median landscaping, and irrigation, with the owner or owners of property along the 
other side of the parkway. 
(5) ?Other entities. If the city establishes a special district or other entity to assume responsibility of 
the parkway system, the owner of property with frontage along the parkway shall automatically 
become a member of the district. This requirement shall also be made a part of any property 
owners' association documents for property affected by creation of a parkway. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 106, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 26-2002, § 1(Exhs. A, B), 7-18-02)

space, and to ensure the protection and conservation of these natural resources and environmentally 
significant lands in perpetuity. In addition, the purpose and intent of this division is to: 
(1) ?Recognize certain native Florida ecosystems within the City of Palm Beach Gardens and Palm 
Beach County are unique, or of limited local occurrence, and are inadequately protected 
through public ownership; 
(2) ?Recognize the city's comprehensive plan includes goals, objectives, and policies to encourage 
the protection of native wetland and upland habitant, sound land planning, orderly growth, and 
concurrency in the provision of public facilities, all of which are dependent upon a healthy tax 
base, a sound economy, and respect for private property rights in the regulation of land uses 
and development; 
(3) ?Recognize the city's native wetlands and upland habitat contain natural resources, and 
environmentally significant lands have unique ecological, scientific, educational, and aesthetic 
values, the protection of which is in the best interests of the citizens of Palm Beach Gardens; 
(4) ?Recognize the environmentally significant lands provide important habitat for a variety of plant 
and wildlife species considered to be endangered, threatened, or of special concern; and 
(5) ?Recognize the City of Palm Beach Gardens desires to protect its environmentally significant 
lands from degradation and loss.

Sec. 78-249. - Approval criteria for proposed land alteration. 
    Approval of land alteration requests. The growth management department may approve requests for 
land alteration consistent with the approved development order. The decision regarding such lands shall 
be based upon application of the criteria listed below. 
(a) ?Value. The project design provides for the protection and preservation of twenty-five (25) 
percent of the most valuable or unique existing natural resources, listed species, and 
environmentally significant lands on site, or on-site restoration or creation of native upland 
environments or habitats. If environmental restoration or creation is proposed in total or in part, 
the applicant must demonstrate that the area to be improved is equal in size to the preservation 
area required by this chapter. 
(b) ?Upland mitigation. If listed species do not exist on the site or on-site preservation would yield a 
preserve area that is less than the preferred minimum of ten (10) acres, or the parcel is east of 
the urban growth boundary, an alternative form of mitigation may be implemented in 
accordance with section 78-252. 
(1) ?Minimum preservation area. A preserve area consistent with section 78-250 and section 
78-252 shall be the basis for any consideration of mitigation of minimum preservation area 
requirements. 
(2) ?Preservation area alternativesGuidelines. 
a. ?When, based on environmental assessments, off-site lands may better advance the 
purposes of this division due to the characteristics of a particular site, such as the 
specific location, invasions of nonnative or exotic species, prior alteration or 
disturbance of vegetation, or other similar circumstances, off-site mitigation or cash in 
lieu of on-site preservation may be utilized, if approved by city council. 
b. ?Parcels located west of the urban growth boundary shall not be allowed to utilize off-
site preservation or cash payment in lieu of on-site preservation. 
c. ?The property owner of a platted upland preserve shall not be permitted to utilize off-
site preservation or cash in lieu of preservation options in order to justify modification 
of the platted upland preserve. 
(c) ?Wetlands mitigation. If land alteration would result in unavoidable impacts to wetlands, as 
determined by the agency having jurisdiction over the subject wetlands, such impacts may be 
mitigated as determined by the agency having jurisdiction. 
(1) ?Preservation. Wetlands are to be preserved and development activity is not allowed in 
wetlands, except under the following circumstances, consistent with adopted Treasure 
Coast Regional Planning Council policies as indicated below. 
a. ?Such an activity is necessary to prevent or eliminate a public hazard. 
b. ?Such an activity would provide direct public benefits which would exceed those lost as 
a result of the development or modification of the wetland areas. 
c. ?Such an activity is proposed for habitats in which the functions and values currently 
provided are significantly less than those typically associated with such habitats and 
cannot be reasonably restored. 
d. ?Due to the unique geometry of the site, it is the unavoidable consequence of 
development for uses which are appropriate, given site characteristics. 
e. ?The functions and values provided by wetland habitats to be destroyed are already 
completely and fully replaced prior to occurrence of the proposed impact to existing 
habitat. 
(2) ?Density transfers. Wetlands shall be protected by use of clustering or similar site 
development techniques to transfer development to upland areas on the same site. Where 
development occurs within jurisdictional wetlands, the developer must mitigate the function 
and value of those wetlands as determined by the agency having jurisdiction over the 
subject wetlands. Development activities within wetland areas shall: 
a. ?Occur at a density of no more than one (1) dwelling unit per five (5) acres in the urban 
area and one (1) dwelling unit per twenty (20) acres in the rural area; 
b. ?Be clustered to the least environmentally sensitive portion of the site; and 
c. ?Include design considerations to protect the wetland functions of the rest of the site. 
(d) ?Listed species. For a site on which listed species are known or suspected to be present, one 
(1) or more of the criteria listed below shall be satisfied. 
(1) ?The applicant successfully demonstrates that the proposed action will not preclude the 
continued survival and viability of those listed species located on the site. 
(2) ?The applicant presents a plan for relocation, either on site or off site, for those listed 
species, which has been reviewed and approved by all agencies possessing jurisdiction in 
such matters.

off-site preserve, the developer shall provide property containing similar or better quality 
native plant communities than those present on the development property, or the 
developer may restore, reestablish, or create native plant environment which exist within 
the limits of the proposed development. The developer/applicant shall provide evidence 
sufficient to demonstrate that such mitigation will be beneficial to species designated as 
endangered, threatened, or of special concern. The city shall bear no costs associated with 
the acquisition, including, but not limited to, surveying, platting, or maintenance of an off-
site preserve. 
d. ?Following city council approval and acceptance of the location of the off-site preserve, but 
prior to the issuance of any land clearing/alteration permits for the development property, a

transfer, conveyance, sale, or alienation of the off-site preserve property may occur without 
city council approval. Additionally, the parcel's maintenance program shall be completed 
prior to the issuance of any land clearing/alteration permit for the development property, 
unless otherwise approved by city council. 
(2) ?Payment in lieu of preservation. 
a. ?Cash payments in lieu of preservation of environmentally significant uplands shall be made 
to a city fund established for the acquisition and management of land containing similar 
native vegetation, other environmentally significant lands, or any ecological or 
environmental improvements to public lands, including, but not limited to, construction of 
nature centers and trails within the city's publicly owned lands. 
b. ?The cash payment shall be equivalent to the average per-acre appraised value of the 
development property, after issuance of development approval by city council, multiplied by 
the number of acres required to be preserved. The appraised value shall be determined by 
an independent certified Florida appraiser, who is acceptable to the city. The developer 
shall pay all costs associated with this option. The city shall bear no cost in determining the 
appraised value and retains the option to request a second appraisal, if deemed 
necessary, at the developer's expense. However, if the city requires a second appraisal 
and the property value as determined by the second appraisal is equal to or less than that 
of the first appraisal, the city shall pay the second appraiser's fee. Approval of payment in 
lieu of preservation shall be at the city council's sole discretion. The timeline for payment 
shall be made part of the development order for the project.

proposed artwork; materials sample board; site plan depicting the proposed location of the 
artwork; landscape plan, if necessary, depicting additional landscaping or modifications to 
existing landscaping; architectural elevations, if necessary, depicting structures associated with 
the artwork; lighting location plan and light fixture details; or other information requested by 
staff, the art in public places advisory board, or the city council. All submittals shall be required 
to provide an accurate representation of the proposed artwork. 
(b) ?Violations. Violation of this chapter shall be subject to enforcement as provided in article VII. 
(c) ?Requirements for art or fee in lieu of art. All new development, except city projects, where total 
vertical construction costs of all buildings on a project site are equal to or greater than $1,000,000.00 
shall provide art valued in an amount of one percent of the total vertical construction costs, as 
provided in this section and section 78-262. All buildings within planned unit developments and 
planned community districts shall be assessed cumulatively towards the art in public places 
requirement, even if they are permitted separately. If the aggregate cost of the entire project exceeds 
the $1,000,000.00 threshold, each phase of development shall contribute the required one percent of 
construction cost towards art in public places for the building project. The art fee for redevelopment 
of an existing building shall be calculated based on the construction costs of the new development, 
excluding the assessed value of the existing buildings that are replaced or redeveloped. 
(1) ?Private development. A private developer may choose either to provide artwork on the project 
site or to contribute one percent of the total vertical construction costs to the city's art impact 
fund. The city's art impact fund shall be interest bearing with all interest to be retained by the 
city. 
a. ?Contribution of art. If the developer chooses to provide artwork, the art in public places 
advisory board shall review the proposed artwork and shall recommend to the city council 
whether to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the selection and location of the 
artwork according to the standards of this division. The artwork shall be provided as 
follows: 
1. ?Deposit of funds. The developer shall submit documentation to the city showing that a 
deposit was made with the developer's attorney into an escrow account in an amount 
of money equal to the art fee prior to the issuance of the first building permit. The 
developer's attorney will furnish the city documentation of the withdrawals for payment 
of art fees in accordance with the terms of the contract between the developer and the 
artist or artists, or the developer's arts consultants. The developer and/or the 
developer's attorney will provide the city a final written certification and accounting of 
the payment of art and consulting fees at the conclusion of the placement of artwork. 
This certification shall be provided in a manner acceptable to the city. 
2. ?Surplus balance. Any surplus balance existing in the escrow accounts after the 
developer has installed the required artwork shall be collected by the city. The surplus 
balance shall be held in a segregated, interest-bearing fund (the "art impact fund"), 
and shall be used for the provision of additional art work at the construction site or 
another site within the city. Use of such funds shall be determined by the city council, 
following a recommendation by the art in public places advisory board, and shall be in 
accordance with further provisions of this division. 
3. ?Artist selection. The selection and commissions of the artists shall be by written 
contract between the developer and artists. 
4. ?Art consultant. The developer may utilize up to 12 percent of the required fee to retain 
an art consultant to assist in the selection and procurement of required artwork; an 
additional three percent of the required fee shall be used to pay the city for 
administering the art in public places program. The art consultant shall have no 
financial relationship with the artist, nor any ownership in artwork purchased by the 
developer. The artist shall be allowed to act as the art consultant for the art petition, 
but shall be precluded from receiving the art consultant fee. 
5. ?Vertical construction cost overruns. Prior to the issuance of the final certificate of 
occupancy for a project, the developer shall submit a revised construction cost 
certification. If the final cost of the vertical construction for the entire project is higher 
than the cost figure used to calculate the preliminary art budget, the art budget shall 
be increased as necessary to equal one percent of the actual defined total vertical 
construction cost for the project. The art budget shall be revised within 30 calendar 
days of any such changes. The increase in the art budget due to the final increase of 
the vertical construction cost for the entire project shall be placed in the city art impact 
fund, or shall be used for the provision of art on site, at the option of the developer. 
6. ?Appraisal. To establish the value of art submitted to comply with this division, the city 
may employ an independent art appraiser to provide a written appraisal of the art 
submitted. Such appraisal will be paid for by the developer as part of the overall art 
contribution. 
7. ?Artwork purchased pursuant to the requirements of this section belongs to the 
property owner, and shall be insured and maintained in good condition at all times as 
determined by the city's code enforcement official. Maintenance shall include any 
associated landscaping or related improvements. The city has the right to maintain 
any art it deems improperly maintained and charge the owner the cost of such 
maintenance, including cost of collection, interest, and attorney's fees. 
8. ?Unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order, or a time 
extension is granted by the growth management administrator, no certificate of 
occupancy for the project shall be issued until the artwork is installed and the final 
certification and accounting of the payment of the escrow fees has been provided. 
Artwork installed in accordance with this division cannot be altered or removed from 
the site without approval of the city council. 
9. ?The artist of approved artwork shall grant to the City of Palm Beach Gardens an 
unlimited, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce and 
distribute two-dimensional reproductions of the artwork for city-related purposes, and 
grant to the city the exclusive irrevocable ownership rights in any trademark, service 
mark, or trade dress rights regarding the artwork, pursuant to a license that shall be 
approved by the city attorney. City approval of the artwork shall be deemed to be a 
grant of the artist for authorization by third parties to review and reproduce documents 
provided by the artist to the city which are deemed to be public records pursuant to 
public record laws of the state. The city shall also have the option of referring to the 
name and title of the artist and artwork in reproductions. 
10. ?Review by the art in public places advisory board. 
A. ?Workshop. The applicant shall appear before the art in public places advisory 
board in order to receive guidance in the initial stages of the review. In this case, 
the applicant shall choose between two types of review described below:

photographs of the artists' existing works, as well as the artists' biographies; 
or 
ii. ?The applicant may have a set direction regarding the artwork and may 
appear before the board for preliminary comments prior to receiving the 
board's final recommendation. The applicant shall submit the portfolio of the 
proposed artist which shall contain photographs of the artist's existing 
works, as well as the artist's biography. 
B. ?Criteria for review of artwork by the board. In making its recommendation to the 
city council, the board shall consider the quality of the artwork; the exhibition and 
sales history of the artist; the artist's works in public collections and previous 
public art purchases or commissions; the ability of the artist to complete the 
project within a specified schedule; and the compliance with the standards of this 
division. 
C. ?Guidelines. The art in public places advisory board may adopt art in public

board and to the city council, staff shall consider the standards of this division in 
association with sound planning principles. 
12. ?In the case of redevelopment of a property which has contributed artwork on the site 
pursuant to this article, the artwork may be replaced, at the option of the developer, 
with new artwork pursuant to this article, or the existing artwork may remain on the 
site. In the latter case, the value of the existing artwork and its placement must comply 
with this article as if it were new artwork. 
b. ?Fee in lieu of artwork. Instead of providing artwork on the project site, a developer may 
choose to contribute one (1) percent of the total vertical construction costs as the required 
art fee. If the contribution is made, the contribution shall be placed in the city's art impact 
fund and used as provided in subsection 78-261(c)(2). The contributor shall have no input 
in the use of such funds.

process or to procure works of art through commission via written contract with a specific 
artist for a specific work of art.

artists to procure a work or works of art. A selection committee will review the 
submitted proposals and shall select at least two finalists for consideration by the art

§§ 78-27178-292, and enacted a new Art. V, Div. 7 as set out herein. Former Art. V, Div. 7 pertained to 
the same subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 17-2000, §§ 122141, adopted July 20, 2000; Ord. 
No. 52-2002, § 2, adopted Jan. 16, 2003; Ord. No. 23, 2006, § 3, adopted Feb. 1, 2007 and Ord. No. 29, 
2009, §§ 24, adopted Dec. 17, 2009. Formerly, div. 6. See the editor's note ch. 78, art. V, div. 3. 


Sec. 78-271. - Intent and purpose. 
(a) ?The purpose of this division is to create the legal framework for a comprehensive and balanced 
system of signage to facilitate the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city and 
to avoid the visual clutter that is harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, business 
opportunities, and community appearance. With these purposes in mind, it is the intent of this 
division to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations and to promote the 
implementation of the city's comprehensive future land use plan. Additionally, it is the intent of this 
division to provide regulations which achieve the following: 
(1) ?Property value protection. Signs should not create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other 
properties as a result of their size, height, brightness, or movement. Signs shall be in harmony 
and compatible with the buildings, uses, and other conforming signs in the zoning district. 
(2) ?Communication. Signs shall not deny other persons the use of sight lines on public rights-of-
way, shall not obscure important public messages, and shall not overwhelm or distract the 
traveling public. 
(3) ?Preservation of community's beauty. Palm Beach Gardens includes numerous planned 
developments with large landscaping buffers consisting of small and large office, retail, 
residential, and industrial uses, and relies heavily on its natural surroundings and beautification 
efforts to retain the city's economic viability. This concern is reflected by the active and objective 
regulations of the appearance and design of signs. 
(4) ?Protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. It is the specific intent of this division to 
provide objective, content-neutral regulations of time, place, and manner in order to preserve 
and protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b) ?Regulations strictly enforced. It shall be unlawful for any persons to post, display, change, or erect a 
sign or sign structure that requires a permit without first having obtained a permit in accordance with 
section 78-276. Signs or sign structures erected without a valid permit shall be deemed in violation of 
this chapter, and it shall be mandatory to obtain the applicable permit, or remove the sign or sign 
structure immediately. All signs not expressly permitted by this chapter are strictly prohibited. 
(c) ?Severability. 
(1) ?Generally. It is the declared legislative intent of the city council of the City of Palm Beach 
Gardens that if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, 
clause, term, or word of division 7, signs, is declared unconstitutional by the final and valid 
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, this declaration of unconstitutionality 
or invalidity shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, 
sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division. 
(2) ?Severability where less speech results. This subsection (c)(2) shall not be interpreted to limit 
the effect of subsection (c)(1) above, or any other applicable severability provisions in the land 
development code or any adopting ordinance. The city council specifically intends that 
severability shall be applied to these sign regulations even if the result would be to allow less 
speech in the city, whether by subjecting currently exempt signs to permitting or by some other 
means. 
(3) ?Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. This subsection (c)(3) shall not be 
interpreted to limit the effect of subsection (c)(1) above, or any other applicable severability 
provisions in the land development code or any adopting ordinance. The city council specifically 
intends that severability shall be applied to section 78-284, prohibited signs and prohibited sign 
locations, so that each of the prohibited sign types listed in that section shall continue to be 
prohibited irrespective of whether another sign prohibition is declared unconstitutional or invalid. 
(4) ?Severability of prohibition on off-premises signs. This subsection (c)(4) shall not be interpreted 
to limit the effect of subsection (c)(1) above, or any other applicable severability provisions in 
the land development code or any adopting ordinance. If any or all of division 7, signs, or any 
other provision of the city's land development code is declared unconstitutional or invalid by the 
final and valid judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the city council specifically 
intends that that declaration shall not affect the prohibition on off-premises signs in section 78-
284. 
(Ord. No. 21, 2010, § 1(Exh. A), 9-30-10)

Sec. 78-279. - Removal of abandoned signs. 
    Any sign which no longer is used to advertise a licensed business or a product sold on premises

such determination shall be provided to the property owner. The owner of the property has ten (10) days 
following receipt of the written notice to remove, repair, or otherwise alter the sign so as to comply with 
this division. If the sign is not removed, repaired, or otherwise altered to comply, the necessary removal or 
improvements shall be carried out by the building division at the expense of the owner of the property. 
The building division shall cause any sign which is an immediate peril to persons or property to be 
removed summarily and without notice. 
(Ord. No. 21, 2010, § 1(Exh. A), 9-30-10) 


Sec. 78-281. - Owner to be charged for cost of removal by city. 
    When the city has caused or paid for the removal of a sign, the actual cost of the removal shall be

b. ?The area of a double-faced sign with sign faces having an interior angle of more than 
fifteen degrees (15°), the area of both sign faces shall be added together to determine 
total area of a sign. 
c. ?The sign area of multi-faced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign 
elements that can be seen at one (1) time or from one (1) vantage point should be 
considered in measuring that particular sign face.

Notes Table 25: 
Should any definition, regulation, or provision set forth in section 78-290 and/or Table 25 or any 
paragraph, sentence, or word be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision 
shall not affect the validity of the remainder of section 78-290 and/or Table 25. 
(*) Exempt from fees and permit registration provided the sign complies with the requirements 
set forth in Table 25 and the Florida Building Code, as applicable. 
(**) A written request for a 30-day extension may be granted administratively provided the 
permanent sign is not completed but is in the process of completion. 
(5) ?Human signs (living signs) . Upon the issuance of a permit, a living or human sign may be 
allowed on the premises of the property that is being advertised or within eight (8) feet of the 
right-of-way immediately adjacent to the property that is being advertised for a maximum of six 
(6) times per calendar year for no more than two (2) consecutive days. The sign area shall not 
exceed three (3) square feet in size, and the living or human sign shall not be permitted off site, 
within the right-of-way, or closer than eight (8) feet from the right-of-way immediately adjacent to 
the property being advertised. Any failure to comply with these regulations will result in the 
administrative suspension or revocation of the sign permit and/or enforcement proceedings 
pursuant to Chapter 162, Florida Statutes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may also 
pursue any remedy available under the law. 
(6) ?Maximum sign faces. A maximum of two (2) faces will be allowed for each temporary sign. 
Maximum size as set forth in Table 25 applies to each sign face individually.

Sec. 78-301. - Purpose and intent. 
(a) ?The purpose and intent of this division is to protect, preserve, and enhance the natural environment 
and beauty of the city by creating minimum standards for installing and maintaining landscaping and 
for vegetation protection. Landscaping that meets these standards provide the benefits listed below. 
(1) ?Appearance. Improve and sustain the aesthetic appearance of the city. 
(2) ?Air and water quality. Improve air and water quality by such natural processes as transpiration 
and the maintenance of permeable land areas for aquifer recharge and surface water filtration. 
(3) ?Noise and pollution reduction. Buffer noise and reduce pollution through the filtering capacity of 
living trees and vegetation. 
(4) ?Energy conservation. Promote energy conservation through: 
a. ?The creation of shade which reduces heat gain in or on buildings and paved areas; and 
b. ?The channeling and control of breezes to facilitate the natural cooling of buildings. 
(5) ?Soil erosion. Reduce erosion by stabilizing the soil. 
(6) ?Habitat provision. Provide habitat for urban wildlife and a planned transition of the city's green 
space and open space to the city's conservation areas. 
(7) ?Water resources. Conserve freshwater resources through the use of drought-tolerant plants 
and mulch, promoting the planting of less sod and water efficient irrigation systems. 
(8) ?Buffering. Provide a visual buffer between otherwise incompatible types of land uses. 
(9) ?Economics. Increase the economic value of land by serving as a capital asset when properly 
incorporated into site design. 
(10) ?Public health, safety, and welfare. Provide for the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b) ?General provisions. In order to fulfill these goals, this division establishes the procedures and 
standards listed below. 
(1) ?Procedures.

footage is relocated so as to emphasize entrance corridors or special landscaped areas within the 
general parking area. 
(d) ?Protection of landscape areas. All landscape areas, except in fee simple residential lots, shall be 
protected by curbs or wheel stops from vehicular encroachment and from the damages caused by 
vehicles overhanging into landscape areas. Landscaping, except grass, shall be required to be at 
least two feet six inches from the edge of the wheel stop or curbing. The curbing shall be at least six 
inches in height above grade. 
(e) ?Overhang areas. Vehicle parking areas designed to permit vehicles overhanging into landscaped 
areas shall not be permitted to count the first two feet six inches of landscape area as open space. 
(f) ?Hedges and berms. The perimeter of vehicle use areas abutting public road rights-of-way, including

shall be 25 feet. 
(c) ?Screening. The preserve area may screen any area that requires screening with the same minimum 
planting requirements as does new landscape material as required herein. Infilling new vegetation 
within preserve areas or around preserve areas shall be required if existing vegetation does not 
provide required screening. Infilling or installation of additional material within preserves shall be 
accomplished by relocating existing on-site native plants or adding appropriate new native plants to 
the voids or bare areas of the preserve to accomplish the required screening. 
(d) ?Irrigation. Irrigation is not required within preserve areas. The area shall be preserved in such a way 
that the transition of new landscaping or open space to existing vegetation duplicates nature. The 
preserve area shall not be adversely impacted by surrounding drainage or elevation changes 
resulting from or caused by development. 
(e) ?Maintenance. Preserve areas shall be maintained or managed with the same standards set forth in 
section 78-329, except there shall be no pruning of vegetation or trees within preserve areas without

(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 159, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 7, 2017, § 18, 3-2-17) 


Sec. 78-319. - Minimum landscape buffer and planting requirements. 
(a) ?Minimum buffer required . A landscape buffer shall be a minimum of eight feet in depth around the 
perimeter of a parcel. However, additional buffer depth shall be provided as indicated below: 
(1) ?A minimum landscape buffer of 15 feet in depth shall be required on lands located adjacent to 
public street rights-of-ways and railroad rights-of-way that are less than 100 feet wide; 
(2) ?A minimum landscape buffer of at least 20 feet in depth shall be required on lands located 
adjacent to public street and railroad rights-of-way that are 100 feet wide or greater; and 
(3) ?A minimum landscape buffer of at least 25 feet in depth shall be required on lands located 
adjacent to Interstate 95 or the Florida Turnpike. 
(b) ?Buffer areas required where commercial or industrial use abuts residential use . 
(1) ?Required buffers. Whenever a commercial or industrial use abuts an existing or future 
residential use, as depicted on the future land use map of the city's comprehensive plan, a 
landscape buffer as described hereinbelow shall be installed. 
a. ?A landscape buffer having a minimum width of 15 feet shall be provided on the commercial 
or industrial parcel along the property line that abuts the neighboring residential property. 
Such buffer shall create a completely opaque visual barrier which may include a fence or 
wall with a maximum height of eight feet. Any such fence or wall shall be setback no less 
than five feet from the property line and shall be substantially skewed from view from the 
adjacent residential use. 
b. ?Alternatively, a berm with sufficient landscaping to create a minimum combined height of 
eight feet adjacent to the abutting property line or at a sufficient distance from the property 
line to allow maintenance of such buffer. 
(2) ?Approval. The use of a fence, wall, or berm as a visual barrier shall be approved by the growth 
management director. 
(3) ?Exceptions. If the commercial or industrial property line is a part of or abuts a public access 
easement or road right-of-way, a ten-foot buffer shall be required. An eight-foot fence, wall, or 
berm with landscaping shall not be required unless the city council determines that such a fence 
or berm is necessary as a visual barrier for the protection of the adjacent residential area. 
(4) ?Other limitations. Buffer areas required by this section shall be in addition to any required 
building setback areas and shall not be used for parking or any other vehicular use. 
(c) ?General . The following general standards shall apply to all landscape materials installed within a 
landscape buffer: 
(1) ?Mature height. Vegetation, especially trees and palms, should be planted taking into 
consideration the mature height and spread of the species. 
(2) ?Areas prohibited in landscape buffers. Stormwater detention or retention areas, and lake 
maintenance easements shall not be located within landscape buffers. 
(3) ?Spacing. The maximum spacing of planting trees shall be 60 feet along any perimeter buffer so 
long as all point requirements have been met. 
(4) ?Preferred plant installation. A minimum of 75 percent of the total quantities of trees and plants 
shall be included within the preferred plant list, as provided in the city's "Landscape Work 
Manual." Coastal areas as designated by the comprehensive plan shall be required to have 90 
percent native species. 
(5) ?Storage and garbage collection sites. All outside storage and trash or garbage collection sites 
shall be completely screened from view, utilizing any approved combination of hedge a 
minimum of three feet in height, structural barriers, berms or any combination thereof to 100 
percent screen the area from view. 
(6) ?Service areas. Service areas of nonresidential buildings, when visible from the street right-of-
way or adjacent residential land use, shall have barriers and a hedge at a minimum of six feet in 
height to screen the service area from this use. Service areas may include interior or exterior 
work bays associated with full service gas stations, tire repair, auto repair business, as well as 
any business proposing loading or unloading docks. 
(7) ?Backflow preventers. Backflow preventer systems shall be screened from public view, utilizing 
any combination of trees, palms, hedges, or other barriers as approved by the growth 
management director. 
(8) ?Total landscaping points. Achieving the total points per open space for an entire project within 
one or more areas does not exempt one from complying with all other requirements, even if that 
means exceeding the minimum required total points per open space. 
(9) ?Signs. Landscaping around ground signs is required and shall be provided pursuant to section 
78-287. 
(10) ?Advertising. At no time shall a landscaped area be used for advertising display or sales, 
unless specifically approved by the city.

field) of artificial turf shall be permitted to count toward open space requirements. Artificial turf shall 
consist of green lifelike individual blades of grass that emulates natural turf. The installation of 
artificial turf shall not restrict or compromise the health or maintenance of natural vegetation required 
by any other section of this Code. The location of artificial turf shall be limited to the following: 
(1) ?In residential lots, the quantity of artificial turf is restricted by the maximum percentage of 
impervious surface for the subject property permitted within the applicable zoning district. 
(2) ?Artificial turf is not permitted within required landscape buffers, parkways, or preserve areas. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 162, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 16, 2014, § 6, 11-6-14) 


Sec. 78-322. - Hardscape and nonliving landscape materials installation requirements. 
(a) ?Use of perimeter walls and fences. Perimeter walls, metal or wood fences, or other nonliving 
landscape materials may be used in conjunction with vegetation to meet required landscaping. 
Approved walls or fences shall be set back from property lines sufficiently to include landscape on 
the outside of the wall or fence. Maintenance of the wall or fence and associated landscaping by the 
property owner is required. If nonliving barriers are used, 50 percent of the barrier shall be covered 
or screened by vegetation on the street side along public rights-of-way and interior perimeter areas 
visible to the public. 
(b) ?Berms. Earth berms may be used only when installed in conjunction with sufficient plant material 
which shall be installed and spaced to satisfy the requirements of this article. The slope of a berm 
shall not exceed a ratio of 3:1. Earth berms may not be installed over underground public utilities 
without written consent from all applicable utility companies. 
(c) ?Mulch. All tree and shrub beds shall receive at least three inches of mulch. Mulch shall be 
temporarily applied to areas not immediately covered by ground cover. Where mulch is intended to

(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 163, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 16, 2014, § 7, 11-6-14) 


Sec. 78-323. - Soil erosion. 
    Soil erosion shall be controlled and held to a minimum during all development activities. Areas in 
which vegetation or ground cover has been allowed to be removed pursuant to an approved site plan and 
subsequently abandoned for any reason for more than six months shall be seeded with a ground cover or 
grass immediately upon request by the city, or the city shall have the work done at the owner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 164, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-324. - Roadway beautification plan. 
(a) ?Applicability. 
(1) ?The standards contained in this section shall apply to all public rights-of-way which are 
adjacent, contiguous or internal to existing and proposed residential and nonresidential 
developments. Landscaping and irrigation are required within roadway medians and road 
shoulders. All approved planned unit developments or planned community developments that 
are subject to major amendments, in accordance with section 78-49 of the land development 
regulations, shall be required to landscape, irrigate and maintain improvements within adjacent 
and/or contiguous public rights-of-way. If a development order requires road improvements not 
adjacent and/or contiguous to the development, the petitioner of the development shall 
landscape and irrigate said road. The intent of this section is to beautify public roads and keep 
the public roads aesthetically pleasing with landscaping and other enhancements. Unless 
otherwise approved through a development order or other agreement, developers and their 
successors or assigns shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of roadway 
landscaping, including irrigation. Where roads have been landscaped and enhanced, but 
become nonconforming due to safety standards implemented by this section, nonconformities 
may be rectified during future road improvements by the person or entity making the 
improvements. 
(2) ?As new developments are approved, it is the intent of this section to require adjacent property 
owners on both sides of the road to share the cost of landscape and irrigation maintenance for 
medians and/or road shoulders based on the linear frontage of each development or by the 
square footage of the area to be maintained. 
(b) ?Landscape plans. Landscape plans for rights-of-way shall be submitted by the applicant and 
approved with each development approval. Landscape plans shall be as detailed as required in 
section 78-305(c)(7) of this division. A cross-section of the road right-of-way, soil profile, drainage 
plan, irrigation plan and root barrier details are required. The community aesthetics board may assist 
city staff in the review of all public roadway landscape plans that are not otherwise approved by 
resolution or ordinance. 
(c) ?Design. 
(1) ?Unless otherwise approved by city council, roadway landscaping shall be designed with 
characteristics similar to the nearest existing roadway beautification project on that road, in 
accordance with the landscape theme provided in section 78-201 or section 78-231, as 
applicable; or using a landscape plan approved by the city for a particular road, e.g. seven cities 
plan for USI or Northlake Boulevard overlay district. The same landscape theme shall be used 
in all four quadrants of any intersection. The landscape design shall be based on the ultimate 
roadway configuration if road improvements shall commence prior to the last certificate of 
occupancy for the entire project. If no road improvements are planned within the build-out date 
of the development, the landscape design may be based on the existing roadway configuration. 
Each of the following specific standards shall apply to all median designs: 
a. ?Future city roads and public access easement roads indicated on the city of palm beach 
gardens' linkage plan or thoroughfare plan shall have medians wide enough to accept a 
tree or palm specie. 
b. ?The median design may be enhanced or changed within 75 feet of a curb cut that directly, 
leads into a development entrance to emphasize or compliment the entry. 
c. ?No more than 40 percent of the total landscape area contained in a median shall be 
covered with sod or grass. 
d. ?Windows or voids in the landscaping (other than sod), if not in excess of 60 feet, are 
acceptable for scenic views of lakes, art in public places, or signage. 
e. ?All trees and/or palms proposed within a median, which are outside of the safe sight 
distance triangle, shall be installed at the same or greater height as the trees and/or palms 
proposed within the safe sight distance triangle. 
(2) ?The plant palette for roadway landscaping is provided in the city's landscape handbook, unless 
otherwise approved by city council. Illustrations of existing roadway landscaping within the city 
have been incorporated into the landscape handbook. These illustrations are representative of 
the desired landscape design. 
(d) ?Installation. 
(1) ?Landscaping installation shall be in accordance with applicable state and/or county engineering 
standards stated in section 62-215 of the City Code. All landscaping and irrigation within the 
right-of-way shall be installed and completed within six months from the issuance of the clearing 
permit for said project or as otherwise approved by the city council. The preparation of the soil 
within the road right-of-way shall include excavation of material detrimental to plant growth. Best 
management practices shall be used for proper soil preparation and drainage of the site. The 
water source for the roadway landscaping may originate from the developer's project so long as 
there is a publicly recorded access easement in favor of the City of Palm Beach Gardens to the 
water source. The electrical service shall have its own meter. 
(2) ?The developer shall be responsible for obtaining all permits through the appropriate agencies. 
If necessary, the city shall act as the permittee on behalf of the developer to facilitate any 
required permit with the state or the county. 
(e) ?Maintenance. The developer and its successors, or assigns shall be responsible for the roadway 
landscaping maintenance. Landscaping maintenance shall be performed in accordance with 
applicable state and/or county engineering standards stated in section 62-215 of the City Code. In 
addition to these standards, the city's landscape maintenance code, section 78-329, and 
maintenance standards provided within the landscape handbook, shall control. Where these 
standards conflict, the stricter standard shall control. The intent of this section is to have the roadway 
maintained to the same standard as the adjacent development landscaping, including weeding the 
median concrete bullnose areas. As new developments or major amendments to approved 
developments occur adjacent to existing roadway beautification projects, the cost to maintain the 
common median shall be shared between the property owners on both sides of the roadway, per 
conditions of development approval or separate agreements, unless otherwise provided in the 
development order. The city shall disclose to all parties any maintenance agreements between 
developments upon request, but it shall be the property owner's responsibility to coordinate the 
maintenance and the shared cost thereof. 
(f) ?Enforcement. Failure to install and maintain roadway landscaping, including plant replacement, shall 
be a violation of this section as well as development order conditions, if applicable. Roadway 
landscaping and maintenance occurring within state, county or city rights-of-way shall be enforced as 
provided in article VII. 
(g) ?Nonconformities on city-owned roads. Any landscaped public road right-of-way dedicated to the City 
of Palm Beach Gardens after May 1, 2002, which falls into a nonconforming status due to changes to 
Palm Beach County's Streetscape Standards in the future, shall be corrected during regularly 
scheduled roadway improvements for said road, unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
Future roadway designs shall attempt to incorporate existing vegetation, including trees and palms, 
into the road improvements through creative engineering and/or new landscaping to replace 
removed vegetation. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 165, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 26-2002, § 3, 10-17-02) 


Sec. 78-325. - Enforcement.

Sec. 78-326. - Exemptions. 
(a) ?Nurseries. All licensed plant or tree nurseries or tree farms shall be exempt from the terms and 
provisions of this article, but only with respect to those trees planted and growing which are for sale 
or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary course of the licensee's business. The buildings 
and parking lots shall adhere to all requirements of this division. 
(b) ?Surveyors. The limited removal of understory vegetation by a state-licensed land surveyor in the 
performance of duties is exempt from the terms and provisions of this article. The swath cleared to 
perform such shall not exceed five feet in width. The surveyor shall not have the right to cut a tree 
three inches in diameter or greater without written consent from the city. 
(c) ?Emergencies. The requirements of this article may be waived by the city manager to facilitate the 
removal of trees or vegetation when a state of emergency has been issued for the city. 
(d) ?Soiling borings and percolation tests. The clearing of a path to provide vehicular access necessary 
to conduct soil percolation or soil bore tests on land is exempt from the terms and provisions of this 
article. However, the path shall not to exceed ten feet in width. The clearing or removal necessary to 
create the path shall be conducted under the direction of a state-registered surveyor or engineer. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 167, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-327. - Tree and plant installation. 
(a) ?Minimum plant quality. Plant quality for all required landscaping shall be Florida No. 1 or better, as 
provided in Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, Part I and Part II, as amended, as published 
by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. An alternative landscape 
improvement plan, as permitted by this article, may propose to use plant materials that do not meet 
the Florida No. 1 or better standard in order to relocate trees, create a transition area between 
landscaped areas and preserve areas, or for design effect. All vegetation shall be clean and free of 
noxious pests or disease. 
(b) ?Preferred species list. A preferred species list shall be prepared by the city, periodically revised, and 
distributed to the public upon request. This species list shall, to the greatest extent possible, 
represent plants that are: 
(1) ?Drought tolerant; 
(2) ?Adapted to cold weather; 
(3) ?Commercially available; 
(4) ?Native or naturalized; 
(5) ?Noninvasive and not destructive to native plants; and

Sec. 78-328. - Pruning. 
    The pruning standards in this article shall apply only to all nonresidential uses and to common areas 
in all planned developments and within developments of regional impact. 
(a) ?Crown reduction. Crown reduction of shade trees shall be prohibited until the tree canopy has 
reached at least 15 feet in diameter, excluding the following: 
(1) ?To remove limbs or foliage presenting a hazard or in conflict with a crime prevention 
program; 
(2) ?To remove dead or diseased limbs; 
(3) ?To reinforce strength of form, or 
(4) ?In association with tree or palm relocation work. 
After a tree canopy reaches 15 feet in diameter, crown reduction shall only be permitted as incidental 
when correct pruning standards are used and when there are constraints such as but not limited to 
power lines and structures. 
(b) ?Plant characteristics. Plant characteristics shall be reviewed during the approval process for 
landscape plans to prevent conflicts with building design, signage, utilities, and drainage. 
Unless otherwise approved by the city, trees shall be allowed to grow to a shape and size 
typical of their species throughout their life cycle. 
(c) ?Pruning standards and requirements. The following are general pruning standards and 
requirements established for the city. 
(1) ?Hatracking. Hatracking is prohibited. For the purposes of this article, hatracking is defined 
as one or more of the following actions: 
a. ?Flat-cut the top or sides of a tree, severing the leader or leaders; 
b. ?Make internodal cuts; prune a tree by stubbing off mature wood larger than three 
inches in diameter; or 
c. ?Reduce a mature tree's total circumference or canopy spread by one-third or more. 
(2) ?Palm trees. Pruning palm trees shall be limited to dead fronds and up to one-third of the 
green fronds and seed pods. 
(3) ?Maximum limb pruning. Maximum limb pruning, or severely cutting back lower branches to 
increase sight visibility from underneath a tree's canopy, shall not exceed 13.5 feet from 
the ground level to the collar of the first limb. 
(d) ?Alternative canopy shapes. If other than the normal expected tree canopy shade and size is 
desired by the owner of the trees, the desired shape and size shall be indicated on the 
approved landscape plan. If a desired shape and size is not noted on the approved landscape 
plan, trees shall be allowed to grow to their natural shape and size. Landowners can request 
that their approved site plans be amended to allow tree shaping if any of the following 
conditions apply: 
(1) ?A tree or trees are located in a constraining situation, such as under power lines; or 
(2) ?A tree or tree's unnatural shape is to be used as an accent or focal point in a landscape 
design, but not for the total landscape design. A maintenance commitment must be clearly 
outlined on the landscaping plan to explain the care and upkeep of unnaturally shaped 
trees. 
(e) ?Performance. Pruning shall be performed by a person or tree service that is knowledgeable 
with the latest standards of the National Arborist Association. Copies of these standards are 
included in the city's landscape handbook. All tree service companies shall obtain a city 
occupational license, or applicable countywide license. 
(f) ?Violations. Excessive pruning, such as hatracking, may be considered tree abuse and a code 
violation by the city's code enforcement board. Each tree hatracked shall be considered a clear 
and separate violation, with a maximum fine of $250.00 for the first tree and a maximum fine of 
$250.00 for each additional tree. If the city's code enforcement board has made a previous 
determination that a person has violated this article, then such person may be charged with a 
repeat violation. A maximum fine of $500.00 for the first tree and a maximum fine of $500.00 for 
each additional tree shall be set by the city's code enforcement board for repeat violation of this 
article. In determining the correctness of particular tree pruning techniques, the city shall use 
the current edition of the "Pruning Standards for Shade Trees," published by the National 
Arbors Association, or any future national standard on shade tree pruning. Tree replacement 
may be required by the code enforcement board. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 169, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-329. - Maintenance.

communities, shall provide an irrigation system plan. The irrigation system shall be designed 
and installed in accordance with the Florida Irrigation Society Standards and Specifications for 
Turf and Landscape Irrigation Systems, as amended from time to time. Irrigation systems shall 
be designed and maintained to obtain the following results: 
a. ?Eliminate the wasteful use of water; 
b. ?Eliminate staining of buildings, walks, walls and other site improvements including 
landscaping; 
c. ?Provide a minimum of 100 percent coverage, including the capability of applying water onto 
turf areas on a different saturation level than that used to irrigate shrub-planting beds; and 
d. ?Eliminate water overthrow onto nonpervious areas. 
(2) ?Irrigation plan. An irrigation plan, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be required as part of 
an overall landscaping plan. The irrigation system plan shall be a minimum scale of one inch

(3) ?Hazards to persons. Landscaping removed due to a health or safety problem to persons shall 
be replaced to meet the intent of the approved landscape plan, or with the requirements of this 
division to the greatest extent possible. For example, if a concept from Crime Prevention 
Through Environmental Design (CPTED) could prevent a problem, alternative plants could 
replace existing landscaping to create a safer environment. 
(4) ?Replacement of dead or diseased landscaping. Landscaping removed due to its death, 
disease, damage or insect-infestation shall be replaced to comply with the approved landscape 
plan, or with the requirements of this division to the greatest extent possible if an approved 
landscape plan is not on file with the city.

* See Figure 16, Parking Stall Schematic. 
Notes: 
(1) ?Dimensional requirements for stalls shall vary depending on the angle of parking provided 
(Column A) and the land use that the parking serves (Column I). 
(2) ?In column I above, "general" applies to parking spaces designated to serve all commercial 
uses, except retail uses and also residential uses with shared parking lots. Spaces to be 
reserved for use by disabled persons shall be governed by the rows labeled "handicapped." The 
label "unspecified" is included to provide a guideline for the design of spaces above the 
minimum required width. 
(3) ?The two (2)-foot landscape overhang shall be provided in accordance with section 78-315. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 179, 7-20-00; Ord. No. 16, 2014, § 8, 11-6-14; Ord. No. 7, 2017, § 19, 3-2-
17) 


Sec. 78-345. - Number of parking spaces required. 
(a) ?Required spaces. The number of off-street parking spaces required for individual uses is 
established in Table 33. For any use not listed in Table 33, the growth management director shall 
determine off-street parking requirements. The standards established in this section provide the 
minimum vehicular parking requirements for the various uses as classified. As indicated in Table 33, 
the growth management director may request additional information to demonstrate compliance with 
overall parking demand. 
(b) ?Mixed uses. For mixed use projects approved by the city council with a specific percentage of 
individual uses, total off-street parking requirements shall be calculated based upon the 
requirements applicable to each individual use. For commercial shopping centers or other centers 
which may provide a variety of mixed uses, the parking requirements for a shopping center shall 
apply. 
(c) ?Reduction in spaces. Unless otherwise provided herein, a reduction in the required number of 
parking spaces may be granted as a variance by the planning, zoning, and appeals board subject to 
section 78-53 or as a waiver to a planned development, PCD, or PUD approval granted by the city 
council. 
(d) ?Increase in parking spaces. 
(1) ?Increase of parking spaces allowed. As applicable to the type of development order, the city 
council, planning, zoning, and appeals board, or growth management director may authorize an 
increase in the number of parking in an amount not to exceed twenty (20) percent of the 
required spaces. Professional office and assisted living facilities may increase the number of 
parking in an amount not to exceed thirty (30) percent of the required spaces. 
(2) ?Requests for additional parking. Excluding PUDs, PCDs, or MXDs, any development order 
application which requests an increase of parking equal to or greater than twenty (20) percent of 
required parking shall be considered by the PZAB as a request for a variance. 
(3) ?Additional parking in PUDs, PCDs, and MXDs. Any request for an increase of parking equal to 
or greater than twenty (20) percent of required parking which affects a PUD, PCD, or MXD shall 
only be considered as an application for approval of a waiver by the city council. 
(4) ?Standards for additional parking spaces. A use which desires to provide parking spaces in 
excess of the minimum requirements of this section shall comply with the standards listed 
below. 
a. ?Additional open pervious space. Additional open space, at a ratio of 1.5 square feet for 
each additional square foot of paved parking and vehicular circulation area, shall be 
provided. The additional pervious open space shall be provided as additional landscaping, 
pedestrian amenities, or vegetative preserve areas, and shall be calculated and identified 
on the project site plan. 
b. ?Enhanced site appearance. The additional open space and landscaping required in this 
subsection shall be utilized to enhance the visual appearance of the improved site, the 
vehicular entries, and the parking areas. The visual enhancements shall be indicated in the 
application for development approval.

selection of grades, cross slopes, curb types, inlet location, etc., to remove the design 
storm rainfall from the pavement in a cost effective manner while preserving the safety, 
traffic capacity and integrity of the highway and street system. These factors are generally 
considered to be satisfied, provided that excessive spreads of the water are removed from 
vehicular travel ways and that siltation at pavement low points is not allowed to occur. The 
guidelines included in this section will accomplish these objectives. 
b. ?Swales. Swale drainage shall be permitted only when the wet season water table is a 
minimum of one foot below the invert of the swale. Swales are not permitted around any 
cul-de-sac. 
c. ?Curb and gutter types. All roadway storm runoff not considered suitable for swale or ditch 
type drainage shall be designed as one of the following: 
1. ?Valley gutter curb section; or 
2. ?Standard curb and gutter section. 
d. ?Design storm frequency. The design storm frequency to be utilized for the design of 
pavement drainage is established below. 
1. ?Arterial streets. Three-year FDOT zone 10, hydraulic gradient line one foot below inlet 
grate line. 
2. ?Collector and local streets. Three-year FDOT zone 10, hydraulic gradient line six 
inches below inlet grate line. 
e. ?Runoff determination. The peak rates of runoff, for which the pavement drainage must be 
designed, shall be determined by the rational method. The time of concentration, individual 
drainage areas, and rainfall intensity amounts shall be submitted as part of the drainage 
plan. 
(2) ?Storm sewer design. Storm sewer system design shall be based upon a three-year FDOT zone 
10 frequency event. The system shall be designed to handle the flows from the contributory 
area within and outside of the proposed subdivision. All storm sewer pipe within public or private 
rights-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe and comply with applicable FDOT standards.

Sec. 78-612. - Applicability. 
(a) ?Generally. Unless otherwise provided, this article shall apply to the development order applications 
listed below. 
(1) ?Any application for change in land use or zoning classification. The requirements of this 
division shall be used in evaluating the appropriateness and desirability of a development order 
application and does not guarantee the approval of any subsequent application for development 
approval. 
(2) ?Others. Any other development order application or approval as defined in this chapter. 
(b) ?Previously-approved development approvals. 
(1) ?Existing approvals. Development order applications to amend an existing development order 
approved prior to the adoption of the traffic performance standards on February 1, 1990, are 
subject to the standards only for the amount of traffic generated in excess of the existing 
approval. 
(2) ?Existing uses. Any development order application affecting property which is presently 
occupied, used, and generating traffic shall be subject to the traffic performance standards only 
for the amount of traffic generated that is in excess of the existing use. For purposes of this 
subsection, the use of a structure or land which has been abandoned for less than five years 
shall be considered an existing use. 
(3) ?Required improvements. Any development order approval amending a previously-approved 
development order which required road construction, right-of-way acquisition, design, 
contribution of money, or other improvements to a link or major intersection shall include a 
requirement to provide performance surety or security to secure the improvements. 
(4) ?Development order amendments. Development order applications to amend an existing 
development order approved after adoption of the traffic performance standards are subject to 
the standards for the amount of traffic generated that is in excess of the existing approval. 
(c) ?Nonapplicability. 
(1) ?Acts and omissions. The traffic performance standards shall not apply to applications for 
development order approval filed after the effective date of the standards if specified acts or 
omissions of the city which were relied upon by the property owner effectively precluded the 
property owner from filing an approvable application for a development approval prior to such 
date. Only the city council may make a determination of the applicability of this subsection. A 
determination of this nature shall be made in a public meeting upon application of the property 
owner. The burden to affirmatively demonstrate by written evidence the applicability of this 
subsection shall be upon the property owner. 
(2) ?City-initiated changes. The traffic performance standards shall not apply to city-initiated future 
land use plan or zoning district designation changes which occur as part of an areawide review 
and district boundary change program. However, the city-initiated change shall not be adopted if 
such changes have the effect of authorizing development that is not subject to the traffic 
performance standards. 
(3) ?Comprehensive plan consistency. The traffic performance standards shall not apply to any city-
initiated future land use plan or zoning district designation amendments to achieve consistency 
with the city's comprehensive plan. However, the city-initiated amendments shall not be 
adopted if the amendments have the effect of authorizing development that is not subject to the 
traffic performance standards. 
(d) ?Entitlement. A site-specific development order may be issued for a project not exceeding 
entitlement density or intensity as set forth in the 1989 comprehensive plan of the Palm Beach 
County, if applicable. Entitlement density for residential land uses shall be based on the densities set 
forth in the land use element of the plan that correspond to the densities established in the city's 
comprehensive plan. Any density exceeding 18 dwelling units per acre shall receive the entitlement 
level set forth in the "5 to 18 dwelling unit per acre" range established by the city. Entitlement density 
for commercial and industrial land uses shall be 2½ percent of the maximum square footage of floor 
area allowed under the land use category or zoning district of the city. 
(e) ?Vested rights. The requirements of this article shall not apply in any manner to impair vested rights 
established pursuant to state law, to the extent that any project or portion thereof is vested and is 
exempt from the requirements of this article.

Sec. 78-623. - Link standard. 
(a) ?Development orders. Except as specifically provided in this division, development order approvals 
shall not be issued which would, during the buildout period of the project, result in project traffic of 
more than five percent of the level of service D service volume, as set forth herein, at any point on 
any major thoroughfare link within the project's radius of development influence, if the total traffic on 
that link would result in a volume that exceeds the adopted level of service volume during the 
buildout period of the project. For purposes of this analysis, committed roadway improvements shall 
be considered. 
(b) ?Service volumes and capacities. All evaluation shall be based upon the "Generalized Annual 
Average Daily Volumes and Generalized Peak Hour Directional Volumes" for Florida's urbanized 
areas as contained in the latest edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Level of Service 
Handbook and Standards Guidelines Manual for Planning.

intersection within the project's radius of development influence, if the intersection would result in 
exceeding level of service "D" standard during the buildout period of the project. 
(b) ?Intersection standards. For purposes of the intersection standards, compliance with the level of 
service "D" standard shall be established using the methodology contained in the latest edition of the 
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). 
(c) ?Average peak hour volumes. If available, the peak season and off-peak season turning movements 
shall be used to determine average peak hour volume. If turning movement counts from both 
seasons are not readily available, the count which is unavailable may be established using factors 
established by the city and county traffic engineer based on the best available data and generally 
accepted traffic engineering principles.

Subdivision III. - Traffic Impact Studies 


Sec. 78-641. - Submission required for development approval. 
    In order to demonstrate that an application for development order approval complies with the traffic 
performance standards, the applicant shall submit a traffic impact study. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 301, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-642. - Scope. 
    The traffic impact study (TIS) shall include the requirements listed below. 
(a) ?Traffic performance standards. The TIS shall address the requirements and standards the city's 
traffic performance standards. 
(b) ?Brevity. The TIS shall be presented concisely, using maps whenever practicable. 
(c) ?Assumptions. The TIS shall state all assumptions and sources of information. 
(d) ?Detail. The form and level of detail required shall be established by the city engineer in accordance 
with accepted traffic engineering principles. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 302, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-643. - Methodology. 
(a) ?Generally. The methods of evaluation, standards, and information in this section shall be addressed 
in the traffic impact study. The city engineer may approve alternate methods if the applicant can 
demonstrate that due to circumstances peculiar to the proposed project or major thoroughfare 
system impacted by the proposed development, other methods or standards provide a more 
accurate means to evaluate the links, intersections, and traffic impact of the proposed project. 
(b) ?Level of service. The TIS shall utilize the levels of service, as defined in section 78-622, for all major 
thoroughfares within the radius of development influence 
(c) ?Traffic assignment. The total traffic shall be generated, and traffic assignments made for each link 
and major intersection within the project's radius of development influence in conformity with 
accepted traffic engineering principles. The assignments shall cover each phase and the buildout 
period of the project. 
(d) ?Radius of development influence. The traffic study shall define the radius of development influence 
up to a maximum travel distance of five miles. 
(e) ?Projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the project shall be set forth in the study 
and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city engineer. 
(f) ?Existing traffic. Average annual daily traffic (AADT) and average peak hour traffic shall be used, as 
defined herein. Where current data are not available to establish existing traffic, the applicant shall 
elect one of the methods listed below to establish existing traffic levels. 
(1) ?Counts. The applicant may provide traffic counts if approved by the city engineer. Traffic counts 
of this nature shall be performed in accordance with accepted traffic engineering principles. 
Counts shall be made during any continuous 24-hour period in accordance with accepted traffic 
engineering principles. All data are subject to review and acceptance based upon accepted 
traffic engineering principles. 
(2) ?Factors. Where a peak season or off-peak season traffic count is not readily available, the 
count which is unavailable may be established using factors established by the city traffic 
engineer based on the best available data and generally accepted traffic engineering principles. 
(g) ?Traffic generation. Traffic generated by the project shall be calculated in the manner listed below. 
(1) ?ITE rates. The rates published in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers 
(ITE) trip generation manual shall be used. However, the city engineer may accept other 
standards that provide a more accurate means to evaluate the rates of generation, including 
palm beach county traffic generation rates. The other standards shall be based upon 
documentation supplied by the applicant which affirmatively demonstrates the alternative 
method based on acceptable engineering principles. 
(2) ?Local conditions. The city engineer or county engineer may publish and update, from time to 
time, trip generation rates for local conditions. If applicable, these rates shall be used instead of 
the ITE rates. 
(3) ?Similar developments. Actual traffic counts, gathered in accordance with accepted traffic 
engineering principles, which establish the generation rate at three similar developments 
located in similar areas may be used if approved by the city engineer. These counts shall be 
made on weekdays, as set forth in subsection (f) of this section, for each site and averaged. 
(h) ?Pass-by trips. Credit against the trip generation of a proposed project may be taken for pass-by 
trips. Pass-by trips shall be based on the most recent rates published by the Institute of Traffic 
Engineering (ITE) or the rates published by Palm Beach County for local conditions. 
(1) ?TIS and pass-by trips. The TIS must detail the following information: 
a. ?all traffic generated from the project and the turning movements, and; 
b. ?the number of pass-by trips subtracted from the traffic generated by the project, during the 
buildout period of the project. 
(2) ?Other uses. If a TIS includes land uses other than those listed in the ITE trip generation manual 
or county documents, and proposes an increase in the percentage credit for pass-by trips 
proposed in excess of the amount in those documents, the calculations shall be justified based 
on accepted traffic engineering principles. The calculations must be acceptable to the city 
engineer as part of the required traffic study, based upon the peculiar characteristics and 
location of the proposed project. 
(3) ?Factors. Factors which should be considered in determining a different pass-by trip rate include 
type and size of land use, location with respect to the surrounding major thoroughfare system, 
and existing and projected traffic volumes. 
(i) ?Internal and intrazonal trip. Reduction in overall trip generation rates may occur as a result of multi-
use or mixed use projects. 
(1) ?Multi-use project. For the purposes of this section, a multi-use project is defined by ITE as one 
that would "contain two or more land uses or building types that each attract people from 
outside the project, would share parking facilities and driveways, and would include 
uninterrupted pedestrian connections." 
(2) ?Mixed use. For the purposes of this division, a mixed-use project would contain two or more 
land uses which are accessible without accessing the major thoroughfare system. 
(3) ?Factors. Internal and intrazonal factors will vary from project to project depending on location, 
size, as well as number and intensity of land uses, and must be justified based on accepted 
engineering principles acceptable to the city engineer. 
(j) ?Background traffic. 
(1) ?Generally. Existing traffic volumes will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of 
the proposed project. The traffic study must account for this increase or decrease in traffic 
based on background traffic during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of 
background traffic will be based upon the information set forth on the historical traffic growth 
table and the table of major projects and shall be established in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in this article and accepted traffic engineering principles. This change in 
traffic shall be shown as it relates to the proposed phasing. 
(2) ?Historical traffic growth table. Using the historical traffic growth table, the study shall project the 
increase or decrease in traffic volumes based on background traffic within the proposed 
project's radius of development influence during the buildout period of the proposed project. 
(3) ?Major project maps. The effect of major projects shall be considered in projecting the increase 
or decrease in traffic volumes. Using the major project table, all traffic from the unbuilt portion of 
major projects approved prior to the proposed project's traffic study which will add more trips 
than ten percent of the level of service "D" service volume within the proposed project's radius 
of development influence during the buildout period of the proposed project shall be specifically 
accounted for in projecting background traffic. No double counting of trips shall occur, and the 
historically-derived projections shall be adjusted based upon the impact of major projects. Only 
the traffic generated from the unbuilt portions of the major projects, as set forth in this 
subsection, which are projected to be built during the buildout period of the proposed project 
shall be considered. 
(4) ?Other considerations. The projection of background traffic coincident with the buildout period or 
any specified phasing program of the proposed project shall consider the criteria listed below, 
subject to the review and approval of the city engineer. 
a. ?Growth characteristics. Characteristics of existing and future growth in the radius of 
development influence. 
b. ?Development. Extent of existing, approved and likely development in the radius of 
development influence. 
c. ?Existing development. Types and sizes of existing and approved development in the area. 
d. ?Traffic circulation. Traffic circulation in the area. 
e. ?Committed projects. Diversions to committed roadway improvements. 
f. ?Traffic patterns. Changes in traffic patterns due to future growth. 
    The intent of the criteria listed above is to ensure that all traffic is accounted for and that double 
counting does not occur. 
(k) ?Committed roadway improvements. Committed roadway improvements shall be considered 
completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the study. Phasing of the project to 
committed improvements shall be required. Confirmation of committed improvements and the timing 
of the commitment shall be subject to the confirmation of the city engineer. 
(l) ?Project phasing. The traffic study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of 
the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place traffic 
impacts on the major thoroughfares and intersections within the radius of development influence. 
The proposed phasing plan shall include the information listed below. 
(1) ?Trip generation. Project traffic figures and assignments for each proposed phase. 
(2) ?Committed roadway improvements. Where the evaluation of a phased traffic impact includes 
the effect of committed roadway improvements, sufficient information regarding the proposed 
construction shall be included to ensure that the roadways realistically will be constructed at the 
times stated. 
(m) ?Intersection analysis. All major intersections within the proposed project's radius of development 
influence to which the proposed project would, if approved, add more than ten percent of total traffic 
on an AADT basis for any link of the major intersection during the buildout period of the project shall 
be analyzed as indicated below. 
(1) ?Methodology. The analysis shall be based on the procedures contained in the latest edition of 
the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). 
(2) ?Committed roadway improvements. The intersection analysis shall include only existing or 
committed roadway improvements as it relates to intersections. 
(3) ?Peak hours. Generally, the study shall address the critical movement analysis during both the 
a.m. and p.m. peak hours unless traffic characteristics dictate that only one of the peak hours 
be analyzed. In those cases, the city engineer may still require analysis of other peak hours 
where indicated by accepted traffic engineering principles. The total peak hours analyzed shall 
not exceed two in number. 
(n) ?Compliance. The analysis must demonstrate compliance with the standards contained in this 
division pertaining to standards, project standards, link standards, and intersection standards. 
(o) ?Professional services. The traffic impact studies for projects shall be prepared, sealed, and signed 
by a professional engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Florida. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 303, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-644. - Site-related improvements. 
    In addition to the link and intersection standards and studies in this article, the peak hour turning 
movements shall be shown and analyzed using the latest edition of the HCM procedures for all points 
where the project's traffic meets the directly accessed links or other roads. No credit shall be taken from 
site-related turning movements for the pass-by trips in this analysis. Recommendations shall be made 
concerning traffic control, laneage, storage requirements, sight triangles and the like. 
(Ord. No. 17-2000, § 304, 7-20-00) 


Sec. 78-645. - Conditions of development order approval. 
    Approval of a development order shall contain such conditions as are necessary to ensure 
compliance with all requirements of this chapter. The city council, planning, zoning, and appeals board, 
and the growth management department approvals are authorized to impose such conditions. The city 
council, planning, zoning, and appeals board, and growth management department may require that a 
road agreement be executed prior to the issuance of the development order approval. Performance 
security shall be required to ensure compliance with the conditions or performance under the road 
agreement. The road agreement or conditions of approval shall be binding on the owner, successors, 
assigns, and heirs. The road agreement, or notice thereof, shall be recorded in the official records of the 
Clerk of Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County.

Sec. 78-683. - MacArthur Banyan Tree Historic Overlay Protection Zone. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. The MacArthur Boulevard Banyan Tree is actually two trees that have grown 
together. The trees are located at the entrance to the City of Palm Beach Gardens and have a 
unique history. City Founder John D. MacArthur had these trees planted at their current location in 
the early 1960's, and they have become an identifying landmark of the city. The first tree dates back 
to approximately 1881, and was planted at its current location in April of 1961. The second tree was 
planted at its current location a couple of years later. The intent of this section is to implement 
protective measures that preserve and enhance the MacArthur Banyan Tree for current residents 
and future generations. 
(b) ?Protection zone established. The MacArthur Banyan Tree Historic Overlay Protection Zone is 
hereby established and shall encompass the area located within 200 feet of the drip line of the 
MacArthur Banyan Tree located in the median of MacArthur Boulevard approximately 150 feet north 
of Northlake Boulevard.

independent analysis at the applicant's expense. 
(3) ?Pruning of the MacArthur Banyan Tree is prohibited unless expressly authorized by the city. 
(4) ?Any activity which kills or damages the MacArthur Banyan Tree, whether intentional or not, 
shall be considered a violation of this section. Such activity may include, but is not limited to, 
improvements or maintenance to roads or drainage systems. 
(5) ?Road widening shall be prohibited within the MacArthur Banyan Tree Historic Overlay 
Protection Zone unless it can be demonstrated that such widening will not kill or damage the 
tree. Any road improvements conducted within the MacArthur Banyan Tree Historic Overlay 
Protection Zone shall use pervious concrete in the resurfacing of the roadway (unless otherwise 
approved the city engineer). 
(6) ?No utilities (above ground or below ground) shall be permitted above or within the crown of the 
MacArthur Banyan Tree, or within the root zone of the MacArthur Banyan Tree. 
(7) ?Development which occurs within the MacArthur Banyan Tree Historic Overlay Protection Zone

mechanical or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a 
structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected 
to a utility system. This certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building, such as a shell 
building, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
    111.5 Revocation. The building official is authorized to, in writing, suspend or revoke a certificate of 
occupancy or completion issued under the provisions of this Code wherever the certificate is issued in 
error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or where it is determined that the building or 
structure or portion thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this 
Code. 


Section 112 - Service utilities. 
    112.1 Connection of service utilities. No person shall make connections from a utility, source of 
energy, fuel or power to any building or system that is regulated by this Code for which a permit is 
required, until released by the building official and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued. The 
servicing utility company shall not connect the power supply until notified by the building official. 
    112.2 Temporary connection. The building official shall have the authority to authorize the temporary 
connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing 
building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
    112.3 Authority to disconnect service utilities. The building official shall have the authority to 
authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated by this Code and 
the referenced codes and standards set forth in Section 101.4 in case of emergency where necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to life, or property, or unsafe condition, or when such utility connection has 
been made without the approval required by Section 112.1 or 112.2. The building official shall notify the 
serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building, structure, or service 
system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the 
owner or occupant of the building, structure, or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as 
practical thereafter.

113.4.2 Variances. The Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals, when upon written request, has 
been so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this Code 
to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice 
and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this or the technical codes or public interest, 
and also finds all of the following: 
1. ?That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, 
structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
2. ?That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of 
the applicant.

use of the building, structure or service system. 
5. ?That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this

Chairperson, irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded, but all 
other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonable, prudent persons in the 
conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be 
admissible in a trial in the courts of Florida. Any part of the evidence may be received in

public inspection. A certified copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the 
appellant and a copy shall be kept publicly posted in the office of the building official for two 
weeks after filing. Every decision of the board shall be final; subject however to such remedy as 
any aggrieved party might have at law or in equity. 
    113.6 Local Construction Regulation Board. The local government may also utilize this Board to 
convene as the Local Construction Regulation Board (LCRB), as provided in Section 489.113, Florida 
Statutes The LCRB may deny, suspend, revoke or limit the authority of a certified contractor to obtain a 
building permit or permit with specific conditions, if the board has found such contractor, through public 
hearing, to be guilty of fraud or a willful building code violation within the county or municipality that the 
board represents. The board may also, deny, suspend, revoke or limit the authority of a certified 
contractor to obtain a building permit or permit with specific conditions, if it has proof through the public 
hearing process, that a contractor has been found guilty in another county or municipality within the past 
12 months, of fraud or a willful building code violation and after providing notice of an opportunity to be 
heard to the contractor, finds that such fraud or violation would have been fraud or a violation if committed 
in the county or municipality that the local construction board represents. Notification of and information 
concerning such permit denial shall be submitted to the department within 15 days after the local 
construction regulation board decides to deny the permit. 


Section 114 - Violations. 
    Any person, firm, corporation or agent who shall violate a provision of this Code, or fail to comply 
therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall erect, construct, alter, install, demolish or 
move any structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or has erected, constructed, altered, 
repaired, moved or demolished a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, 
without full compliance with applicable codes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor. Each such person shall be considered guilty of a separate offense for each and every day 
or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the provisions of applicable codes, laws, 
ordinances, rules and regulations is committed or continued, and upon conviction of any such violation 
such person shall be punished within the limits and as provided by state laws. Nothing in this section shall 
prevent the authority having jurisdiction from imposing fines, liens, or seek injunction relief, or exercising 
other enforcement powers as permitted by law. Code enforcement and penalties of Chapter 162 Florida 
Statutes Part I shall be authorized if building work begins without payment of all required fees, and for the 
purposes of enforcing this Code, code officials licensed under Chapter 468, Florida Statutes, Part XII are 
deemed "Code Inspectors", as defined in Section 162.04, Florida Statutes. 


Section 115 - Stop work order. 
    115.1 Stop work orders. Upon notice from the building official, work on any building, structure, 
electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system that is being done contrary to the provisions of this Code 
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. 
    115.2 Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the 
property involved, or to the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work 
order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order, 
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume. Where an emergency exists, 
the building official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work. 
    115.3 Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with 
a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe 
condition, shall be subject to penalties as prescribed by law. 


Section 116 - Unsafe structures and equipment. 
    116.1 Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing 
systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire 
hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard 
to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. All such unsafe buildings, 
structures or service systems are hereby declared illegal and shall be ordered by the building official to be 
abated by the owner, through repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with this Code. The 
extent of repairs shall be determined by the building official. 
116.1.1 When the building official determines a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or 
plumbing system or portion thereof is unsafe, as set forth in this Code, or in reference to the 
International Property Maintenance Code, current edition, promulgated by the International 
Code Council, Inc., he/she shall provide the owner, agent or person in control of such building, 
structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system a written notice of violation stating the 
defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner within a stated time either to complete 
specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove the building, structure, electrical, 
gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof. At the option of the local government, 
the processes and procedures for code enforcement under Chapter 162 Florida Statutes may 
be utilized to abate a violation under this section. If this statutory method of enforcement is 
invoked, the building official shall act in the role of code inspector to initiate enforcement 
proceedings, and notice shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. The building 
official shall refer to the International Property Maintenance Code exclusively for safety 
purposes and not aesthetic purposes and only as to structural, electric, gas, mechanical or 
plumbing deficiencies for the purposes of protecting life, health, and property, and ensuring 
public safety. Enforcement activity by the building official shall be limited to Chapter 2; Chapter 
3 Sections 303 and 304, but excluding sections 3304, 305 and 306; Chapter 4; Chapter 5 and 
Chapter 6 of the International Property Maintenance Code. 
116.1.2 If necessary, the notice shall also require the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, 
plumbing systems or portion thereof to be vacated and/or disconnected, and not reoccupied 
and/or reconnected until the specified repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and 
approved by the building official. The building official shall post at each entrance to the building 
a placard stating: THIS BUILDING IS UNSAFE AND ITS USE OR OCCUPANCY HAS BEEN 
PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING OFFICIAL. This placard shall remain posted until the required 
repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or 
corporation or its officers, agents, or other servants, to remove the posting without written 
permission of the building official, or for any person to enter the building, or use the building or 
system(s) except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing same. 
116.1.3 In case the owner, agent, or person in control cannot be found within the stated time limit, or, 
if such owner, agent, or person in control shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with notice to 
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish, and remove said building, structure, electrical, gas, 
mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof, the building official, acting as a code 
inspector, shall notify an enforcement board and request a hearing. In the case of the violation 
posing a serious threat, and after having ascertained the cost, the building official may take 
action to cause such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or 
portion thereof, to be demolished, secured, repaired, or required to remain vacant or unused. 
Taking such action does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the building official to 
continue with maintaining such building, structure, or system; or create liability for any damage 
to the property. 
116.1.4 The decision of the building official shall be final in cases of emergency, which, in the opinion 
of the building official, involve imminent danger to human life or health, or the property of others. 
He/she shall promptly cause such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing 
system or portion thereof to be made safe or cause its removal. For this purpose he/she may at 
once enter such structure or land on which it stands, or abutting land or structures, with such 
assistance and at such cost as he may deem necessary. He/she may order the vacating of 
adjacent structures and may require the protection of the public by appropriate fence or such 
other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose may close a public or private way. 
    116.2 Enforcement proceedings; hearings. Violation proceedings and hearings for unsafe structures 
and equipment will be conducted before the code enforcement board or special magistrate in accordance 
with the provisions set forth in Chapter 162, Florida Statutes. The owner of property that is subject to an 
enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court is required to make 
disclosures as outlined in Chapter 162, Florida Statutes before a transfer of property, and failure to make 
the required disclosures creates a presumption of fraud. 
    116.3 Administrative fines; costs to repair; liens. All costs associated with taking a case before the 
enforcement board shall be recovered where the jurisdiction prevails. Whenever one of the orders of the 
enforcement board or the special magistrate has not been complied with by the time set for compliance, 
for each day thereafter during which each violation continues past the date set for compliance, the 
enforcement board or the special magistrate may impose a fine. All costs incurred as a result of actions 
taken per Section 116.1.3 are charged to the violator. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a 
fine plus repair, and the costs of prosecuting the case, may be recorded in the public records and shall 
thereafter constitute a lien against the land where the violation exists and upon any other real or personal 
property owned by the violator. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection, 
and it has been complied with by the date specified in the order, the enforcement board shall issue an 
order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public record. A hearing is not required for 
the issuance of such a compliance order. 
    116.4 Appeal. An aggrieved party, including the local governing body, may appeal a final 
administrative order of an enforcement board or special magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal 
shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the 
enforcement board. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 


Section 117 - Tests. 
    The building official may require tests or test reports as proof of compliance. Required tests are to be 
made at the expense of the owner, or agent, by an approved testing laboratory or other approved agency. 


Section 118 - RESERVED. 


Section 119 - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code is for any reason held to be 
unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Code.

improvements proposed are completed so as to avoid economic and aesthetic blight in the city. 
(b) ?Prior to the issuance of a building permit, all developers shall post with the city surety in an amount 
determined by the city engineer to be sufficient to ensure that all required public improvements shall 
be completed. If the public improvements identified in this section are not completed in accordance 
with the phasing plan established for the development, the city may, in its sole discretion, use the 
posted surety to complete the required public improvements in accordance with the approved plans. 
(c) ?Any surety provided shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of the 
improvements. 
(d) ?Acceptable forms of surety may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
(1) ?Cash escrow; 
(2) ?Irrevocable letter of credit from a solvent financial institution authorized to do business in the 
state; and 
(3) ?Any other form of surety acceptable to the city manager, in consultation with the city attorney 
and city engineer.

Sec. 86-29. - Hurricane shutters. 
    Beginning December 1 of each year through June 1 of the following year, the use or closure of 
hurricane shutters, of any type whatsoever, to cover building/structure openings shall be strictly 
prohibited. However, in the event that any portion of Palm Beach County falls within the National 
Hurricane Center's five-day cone of probability for a named tropical storm event, hurricane shutters may 
be used to protect building/structure openings up to five days prior to storm landfall and may remain in 
place for no more than five days following storm passage. Nothing in this section shall preclude the 
issuance of building permits for the installation of various hurricane shutter systems. 
(Ord. No. 31, 2008, § 3, 12-4-08) 


Sec. 86-30. - Maximum occupancy. 
(a) ?Minimum floor area. Every dwelling unit shall contain at least 150 square feet of floor space for the 
first occupant thereof and at least an additional 100 square feet of floor area per additional occupant. 
The floor area shall be calculated on the basis of the total area of all habitable rooms. 
(b) ?Required space in sleeping rooms. In a dwelling unit, every room occupied for sleeping purposes by 
one occupant shall contain at least 70 square feet of floor area, and every room occupied for 
sleeping purposes by more than one occupant shall contain at least 50 square feet of floor space for 
each occupant thereof. 
(c) ?Violations. Each occupant in excess of the maximum number allowed pursuant to the minimum floor 
area or minimum sleeping area requirements, as set forth hereinabove, shall be considered a single 
and separate irreversible/irreparable violation and shall be further considered a threat to the health, 
safety, and welfare of the public. The city specifically reserves the right to enforce the provisions of 
this section by any legal means available. 
(d) ?Additional regulations. The regulations contained in subsections (a), (b), and (c) above are minimum 
standards in addition to those regulations set forth in the Florida Building Code. In the event of a

Sec. 86-39. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of 
the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, 
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of 
development in flood hazard areas to:

flooding; 
(2) ?Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future 
flood damage; 
(3) ?Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of 
equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 
(4) ?Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the 
impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6) ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
hazard areas;

scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be 
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped 
special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from 
flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood 
Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of 
Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the

CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE ORDINANCES 
This table gives the location within this Code of those ordinances adopted since the 1987 Code, 
as updated through November 17, 1994, which are included herein. Ordinances adopted prior to 
such date were incorporated into the 1987 Code, as supplemented. This table contains some 
ordinances which precede November 17, 1994, but which were never included in the 1987 Code, 
as supplemented, for various reasons. Ordinances adopted since November 17, 1994, and not 
listed herein, have been omitted as repealed, superseded or not of a general and permanent 
nature.
