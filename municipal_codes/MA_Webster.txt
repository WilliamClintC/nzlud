Wildlife Feeding
[Adopted 10-17-2016 FATM, Art. 15]
§ 314-1. Purpose.
The intent of this bylaw is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the community. It has been established that feeding waterfowl and other
wild animals increases the potential for damage to public and private
land and property. Feeding may elevate the potential for the spread of
diseases in people. Feeding of gulls especially endangers water quality
and drinking water supplies, according to the Massachusetts Department
of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Water Supply Protection. In
addition, it is the intent of this bylaw to protect the welfare of wild animals
and waterfowl as feeding can interrupt their normal feeding patterns, can
cause nutritional problems, threaten their health and promote the spread of
diseases.
§ 314-2. Definitions.
As used in this and subsequent sections:
DESIGNATED ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY — Shall mean Webster Animal

depositing, distributing, or scattering, directly or indirectly, of any grain,
shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, seeds, wheat, bread or bakery

feed or nutritive substances, in any manner or form, so as to constitute for
such wildlife a lure, attraction, or enticement to, on, or over any such areas
where such feed items have been placed, exposed, deposited, distributed,
or scattered.
WILDLIFE — Shall mean any undomesticated and unrestrained animal or
fowl, including but not limited to bears, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, skunks
and other animals or fowl (including gulls and geese) causing public safety
threats or nuisances.
§ 314-3. Prohibited activity.
No person shall feed any wildlife on public or private property within the
Town of Webster. Whenever the Webster Animal Control Officer or any
designated enforcement authority becomes aware that wildlife has been
found feeding on any substance, as defined above, and the landowner or
person committing the act has been notified of the occurrence by any
person authorized to enforce this bylaw, and wildlife is thereafter found
feeding on any such substance after any act of the commission or omission
§ 314-1 CHARTER § 314-3
C:65
by the landowner or other person, such feeding shall be prima facie
evidence that the feeding was with the knowledge or consent of the
landowner or other person.
§ 314-4. Exceptions.
Nothing in this bylaw shall be construed to limit the feeding of
domesticated waterfowl, as defined by the Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife, by a farmer as defined in MGL c. 128, § 1A on property owned
or leased by him, or the feeding of waterfowl or any other birds by
propagators licensed under MGL c. 131, § 23 when such waterfowl or
other birds are confined in such a manner as may be required pursuant

D.
Any individual, company, or corporation that is engaged in lawful
agricultural pursuits, including but not limited to growing crops, cropbearing
plants or raising livestock.
E.
This section shall not be interpreted so as to prohibit bird feeders.
However, if a bird feeder is determined to be the cause of a public
safety threat or nuisance, the bird feeder(s) and seed debris will be
required to be removed within 48 hours.
F.
This section shall not be interpreted so as to prohibit the feeding of
pets, provided that if food intended for pets is determined to be the
source of wildlife feeding, the landowner or person responsible for
the premises will be required to take steps to render such pet food
inaccessible to wildlife, including the requirement that pet food be
removed. If any wildlife gains access to pet food, the condition allowing
access must be corrected or the pet food removed within 48 hours.
G.
This section shall not be interpreted so as to prohibit or discourage the
trap-neuter-return program, supported by the MSPCA, in the handling
of feral cats.

refuse, food product, pet food, or other material or nutritive substance
on any premises in a manner which does not constitute a lure,
attraction or enticement of wildlife on property within the Town of
Webster, provided that if such storage is determined to be the source

WETLANDS PROTECTION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Stormwater management — See Ch. 570. Zoning — See Ch. 650.
§ 636-1. Purpose.
§ 636-2. Conditional exceptions.
The purpose of this bylaw is to protect the floodplains, wetlands and
related water resources, riverfront areas and adjoining land areas in
the Town of Webster by prior review and control of activities deemed
to have a significant effect upon wetland or resource area values,
including, but not limited to, the following: public or private water
supply, ground water, water quality, flood control, sedimentation and
erosion control, storm damage prevention and flowage, water pollution
control, wildlife and wildlife habitats, fisheries, fish and shellfish
habitats, rare plant and animal species, agriculture, aquaculture and
recreation values deemed important to the community (collectively,
the "wetland values protected by the bylaw"). This bylaw is adopted
under authority of Section 6, Article 89 of the Amendments to the
Massachusetts Constitution, known as the Home Rule Amendment, and
MGL c. 40, § 21.
A.
All of the procedures and requirements set forth in the Wetlands
Protection Regulations of 310 CMR 10.00 et. seq. are hereby
incorporated and made a part of these regulations except where they
differ from or depart from these regulations. Where these regulations
differ from or depart from the state regulations, they shall take
precedence over the state regulations. The applicant should first
address the regulations at 310 CMR 10.00 et. seq. and then supplement
them with the Webster Wetlands Protection bylaw. Unless otherwise
indicated in the bylaw or these regulations, definitions, timeframes,
forms and procedures shall be the same as stated in the Massachusetts
Wetlands Protection Act.
B.
The Commission, its agents, officers and employees shall have authority
to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their
duties under this bylaw and may make or cause to be made such
examinations, surveys or sampling as the Commission deems necessary,
subject to the constitutions and laws of the United States and the
Commonwealth.
C.
The Order of Conditions and application required by this bylaw shall
not be required for maintaining, repairing or replacing, but not
substantially changing or enlarging an existing and lawfully located

structure or facility used in the service of the public to provide electric,
gas, water, telephone, telegraph, and other telecommunication services
provided that written notice has been given to the Commission prior to
the commencement of any work, and provided that the work conforms
to performance standards and design specifications in regulations
adopted by the Commission.
Any agricultural activity as defined by the Farm Assessment Act, MGL c.
61, 61A, 61B, and/or c. 132 exempt from the provisions of the Wetlands
Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, MGL c. 128, § 1A, and from the
Wetlands Protection Regulations 310 CMR 10.00 (normal maintenance
or improvement of land in agricultural use) will also be exempt under
this bylaw.
B.
Fee Schedule.
At the time an application is filed, the applicant shall pay a fee
specified in the regulations of the Commission. The filing fee is in
addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act (MGL c.
131, § 40 and Regulations 310 CMR 10.00 et. Seq.). These filing
fees are nonrefundable.
(1)
The Conservation Commission shall use such fees to implement this
bylaw, the regulations promulgated hereunder, and any policies
developed by the Conservation Commission including, but not
limited to, the employment of a Conservation Consultant/Agent.
The responsibilities of the Conservation Consultant/Agent may
include, but are not limited to: review of resource areas,
performing site visits, briefing the Conservation Commission,
serving as liaison between the Conservation Commission,
applicants, abutters, consultants and other interested parties,
drafting Determinations of Applicability and Orders of Conditions,
verifying implementation of erosion control measures, facilitating
Public Hearings, reviewing requests for certificates of compliance
and enforcing the provisions of this article, the regulations
promulgated hereunder, and the policies developed by the
Conservation Commission.
(2)
The Conservation Commission may waive the filing fee for a Notice
of Intent application or a Request for Determination of Applicability
filed by a government agency.
(3)
A.
Wetlands Consultant Fees.
In order to enforce the regulations promulgated hereunder, and the
policies developed by the Conservation Commission to the extent
consistent with MGL c. 44, § 53G and any other law pertaining
thereto, or at any point during the review of an application until a
Certificate of Compliance is issued, the Conservation Commission
(1)
B.
§ 636-2 WEBSTER CODE § 636-3
C:144
§ 636-4. Violations and enforcement.
may find that the assistance of outside consultants is warranted
due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project or
because the project may have a significant effect upon the values
the Conservation Commission is authorized to protect. The exercise
of discretion by the Commission in making its determination to
require the payment of a consultant fee shall be based upon its
reasonable finding that additional information acquirable only
through outside consultants would be necessary for the making of
an objective decision.
In such instances where consulting fees are required, the
Commission shall notify the applicant of this need and shall provide
the opportunity for the application to be amended or withdrawn.
Should an applicant choose to proceed, the Commission shall
require the applicant to pay the fees for these consulting services.
The consultant services may include, but shall not be limited to,
ascertaining the extent of the Conservation Commission's
jurisdiction, analyzing resource area functions and values,
evaluating ecosystem management such as wildlife habitat,
analyzing hydrogeologic and drainage conditions, providing
assistance during appeal or litigation, researching environmental
or land use law, and inspecting work to insure compliance. The
Commission shall return any unused portion of the consultant fee
to the applicant unless the Commission decides at a public meeting
that other action is necessary.
(2)
Outside consultants shall be chosen by the Commission. Any
applicant aggrieved by the imposition of, or size of the consultant
fee, or any act related thereto, may appeal to the Board of
Selectmen, in accordance with the provisions of the MGL c. 44
§ 53G. The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims
that the consultant selected has a conflict of Interest or does
not possess the minimum required qualifications. The standard of
qualification shall consist of Massachusetts certification or license
in the field at issue or references mutually acceptable to the
Commission and the applicant, showing expertise and experience
in the field at issue. The required time limit for action upon an
application by the Commission shall be extended by the duration of
the administrative appeal.
(3)
No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, or otherwise
alter protected resource areas, or cause, suffer, or allow such activity,
or leave in place unauthorized fill, or otherwise fail to restore illegally
altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply with a permit or
an enforcement order issued.
A.
When possible violations are reported, a Commissioner or the
Conservation Consultant/Agent will determine whether a violation
exists and if an Enforcement Order is necessary. The Commission
B.
§ 636-3 CHARTER § 636-4
C:145
Consultant/Agent may consult with the Commission Chairman and
other members as necessary, but if time or other constraints exist, may
proceed employing best judgment. Any Enforcement Order issued by
any individual must be ratified by the Commission at a public meeting.
If a Commissioner or the Conservation Consultant/Agent confirms or
strongly suspects a violation, an Enforcement Order will be issued.
Enforcement Orders will direct the property owners and contractors to
(1) stop work, (2) identify resource areas on the site, (3) install erosion
controls, and (4) meet with the Commission to discuss the violation.
C.
If a wetland line has been previously approved by the Commission, its
location will be the basis for evaluation of the violation. If a wetland
line has not been established or approved by the Commission, then the
Commission or Enforcement Order may require the owner, developer,
and contractor to employ a wetland scientist to identify wetland
resource areas with flagging within a time frame not longer than two
weeks from the date of the Enforcement Order. All Enforcement Orders
will be maintained in the Conservation database and placed on file. At
the subsequent meeting, the Commission will consider the following
aspects of the violation: value of the area to the statutory interests,
harm of the damage, immediacy of the harm, value of restoration,
feasibility of restoration, potential legal outcomes, and potential
financial burden to the Town of Webster.
D.
The Commission shall have authority to enforce its regulations and
permits by the issuance of Enforcement Orders, administrative orders
and the initiation of civil and criminal court actions. Any person who
violates the provisions may be ordered to restore the property to its
original condition and take other action deemed necessary to remedy
such violations, fined, or both. The enforcing officers in the noncriminal
disposition procedure shall be members of the Conservation
Commission or its agents.
E.
Upon request of the Commission, the Town Administrator and the Town
Counsel shall take legal action for enforcement under civil law. Upon
request of the Commission, the Chief of Police shall take legal action
for enforcement under criminal law. Municipal boards and officers,
including any police officer or other officer having police powers, shall
have authority to assist the Commission in enforcement. As an
alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission
may issue citations under the non-criminal disposition procedures set
forth in MGL c. 40, § 21D.
F.
In addition to any other remedies available under any law or this
bylaw, any person who violates any provision of this bylaw, regulation,
permit or administrative order issued, may be fined according to the
fine schedule below. The fine for filling in a wetland or resource area
shall be seventy-five dollars ($75) per square foot per day. Each day or
portion thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized fill
or other alteration remains in place, shall constitute a separate offense

C.
§ 650-24 CHARTER § 650-24
C:171
on-site waste disposal systems shall, to the degree feasible, be
located outside the District.
Disposal. Provisions shall be made to assure that any waste
disposed on the site shall contain no hazardous materials, or shall
be disposed in strict accordance with 310 CMR 30, Hazardous
Waste Regulations.
(3)
Drainage.
Provision shall be made for on-site recharge of all stormwater
runoff from impervious surfaces unless, in cases where such
surfaces are no more than 15% of lot area or 2,500 square
feet, whichever is larger, the Planning Board in conducting Site
Plan Review and following consultation with the Conservation
Commission, determines that either recharge is infeasible
because of site conditions or is undesirable because of
uncontrollable risks to water quality from such recharge
following consultation with the Conservation Commission.
(a)
Recharge shall be by surface infiltration through vegetative
surfaces unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board
following consultation with the Conservation Commission. Dry
wells shall be used only where other methods are infeasible

on the premises, accompanied by a description of the measures
proposed to protect all storage containers or facilities from
(a)
(2)
D.
§ 650-24 WEBSTER CODE § 650-24
C:172
vandalism, corrosion, and leakage, and to provide for control
of spills.
A description of potentially hazardous wastes to be generated,
including storage and disposal methods.
(b)
Evidence of qualified professional supervision of design and
installation of any proposed storage facilities or containers for
hazardous materials or waste.
(c)
For disposal on-site of domestic wastewater with an estimated
sewage flow greater than 10,000 gpd per Title 5, evidence of
qualified professional supervision of design and installation,
including an assessment of nitrate or coliform bacteria impact
on groundwater quality.
(d)
Special permit criteria.
Special Permits under Subsection D shall be granted only if the
SPGA makes the following determinations:
If on-site disposal is the reason a special permit is required
[Subsection B(2)(b), (c) and (d)], that for the portion of the
site within the Lake Watershed Protection District, nitrate
loading would not exceed 10 parts per million based upon
the following estimates, or other figures approved for the
specific project:
Sewage volume based on realistic estimate (not simply
design volume as required under Title 5).
Rainfall = 42 inches.
Fertilizer adds 0.6 pounds of nitrates per 1,000 square
feet of lawn or garden.
Nitrate concentrations:
Leachate effluent = 40 ppm.
Pavement runoff = 3.0 ppm.
Roof runoff = 0.75 ppm.
Natural area recharge = 0.05 ppm.
Recharge percentages:
Leachate effluent = 95%.
Pavement and roof = 95%.
Natural and fertilized areas = 45%.
and also that for other contaminants, similar analysis
would indicate groundwater meeting all standards for
drinking water (310 CMR 22.00).

contaminant plumes may be required;
That proposed control and response measures adequately
and reliably mitigate risk to groundwater quality resulting
from accident or system failure.
[3]
In its written decision the SPGA shall explain any departures
from the recommendations of other Town agencies.
(b)
The Special Permit Granting Authority may retain qualified
experts at the reasonable expense of the applicant if necessary
in order to evaluate the application.
(c)
Conditions. Special permits shall be granted only subject to such
conditions as necessary to assure adequate safeguarding of water
quality, which may include the following, among others:
Monitoring wells to be located downgradient of potential
pollution sources, with periodic sampling to be provided to the
Board of Health at the owner's expense.
(a)

areas, and to minimize the removal of trees and other vegetation, thereby
preserving rural character. The applicant shall submit documents, plans,
and profiles for approval to the Planning Board to assure compliance with
the following standards for common driveways:
neighboring television and radio reception or otherwise be a public
nuisance or hazard.
The maximum grade shall be 10%. The minimum grade shall be 1%,
with a 5% maximum grade within 50 feet of the driveway's intersection
with a street. The minimum centerline radius shall be 60 feet. The
maximum length shall be 1,000 feet.

The common driveway shall exit onto the frontage street with a
minimum angle of intersection of 75°, and shall be located entirely
within the boundaries of the lots being served.
C.
An easement with a minimum width of 24 feet shall be created and
recorded along with the deeds for the lots to assure maintenance,
drainage, snow removal, rubbish collection, and the like, and liability
for the common driveway shall remain the responsibility of the private
parties, or their successors-in-interest, in perpetuity. A copy of the draft
maintenance agreement shall be submitted with the application.
D.
The Planning Board may grant waivers to the requirements of
Subsections A, B and C if they find that doing so would not have a
detrimental impact on public safety.

ARTICLE VIII
Wireless Communications Facilities
[Added 10-16-2000 FATM, Art. 3]
§ 650-61. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CARRIER — A company that provides wireless services.
CO-LOCATION — The use of a single mount on the ground or several
mounts on an existing structure by more than one carrier.
COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES — Any antenna, dish or panel mounted out
of doors on an already existing building or structure used by a commercial
telecommunications carrier to provide telecommunications services. The
term "communications device" does not include a Tower because that term
is defined separately.
OPERATOR — The party currently responsible for the maintenance and
physical security of a Wireless Communications Facility (WCF). Initially this
is the applicant. Since the applicant might lease the WCF site, the Operator
might differ from the site's owner. The Operator is also distinct from other
carriers who have co-located equipment on the WCF.
SECURITY BARRIER — A locked, impenetrable wall or fence that
completely seals an area from unauthorized entry or trespass.
TOWER — Any equipment mounting structure that is used by a commercial
telecommunications carrier to support reception or transmission equipment
and that measures 12 or more vertical feet.
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITY (WCF) — Any materials,
equipment, storage structures, towers, dishes and antennas, other than
customer premises equipment, used by a commercial telecommunications
carrier to provide telecommunications or data services. This definition does
not include facilities used by a federally licensed amateur radio operator
nor television antennas and satellite dishes which are for residential use.

17
physical improvements to and within such a way of access, in accord with the provisions of Section V. of these regulations.
2. Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the applicant to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to a width at least commensurate with that required within the subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within such public way to the same standards required within the subdivision. Any such dedication of land for the purpose of way and any such Work performed within such public way shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne by the applicant.

3. Street Hierarchy.
a. Streets shall be classified in a street hierarchy with design tailored to average daily traffic (ADT) calculated by trip generation rates. Each detached single family dwelling shall be deemed to generate ten (10) ADT. For other uses, the applicant shall refer to the latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The Board may allow rates from other sources to be used if the applicant demonstrates that these sources better reflect local conditions
b. Each residential street proposed in a subdivision shall be classified and designed for its entire length to meet the Standards for the street type depending upon the average daily traffic the road is expected to carry.
1. Residential access streets shall be designed so that no section conveys an ADT greater than two hundred fifty (250). Each half of a loop street may be classified as a single residential access street but the total traffic volume generated on the loop street should not exceed five hundred (500) ADT, nor should it exceed two hundred fifty (250) ADT at any point of traffic concentration.
2. Subcollectors shall be designed so that no section conveys an ADT greater than five hundred (500). Each half of a loop subcollector may be classified as a single subcollector street, but the total traffic volume conveyed on the loop street should not exceed one thousand (1,000) ADT, nor should it exceed five hundred (500) ADT at any point of traffic concentration.
3. Residential collectors shall be designed so that no section conveys an ADT greater than three thousand (3,000).
4. Arterial streets convey an ADT greater than three thousand (3,000) and should be excluded from residential areas. Design for arterials shall meet the specifications of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works.
c. Table 1 lists the specific standards for various design elements to which each street in the hierarchy must conform.
4. Dwelling Unit Access.
a. Access to Residential Collectors: Whenever possible, these streets should be designed to limit access to residential lots by the following means:
1. Creation of lots which back onto the residential collector and front on a lower order street parallel to it.
2. Use of common driveways, cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short loops with access to lots provided lower order streets.
3. Design of a service road separated from the residential collector by plantings or a grass strip.
b. Access to Arterial Streets: Whenever a subdivision that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on an arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within the subdivision onto this street.

2. The Board may grant a waiver to allow steeper grades where due to severe topography, such grades are necessary to minimize cuts and fills. Waivers may not allow the grades shown above to be exceeded by more than two (2) percent.
3. The street classification with the higher requirement shall govern.
4. When a street intersects a street of higher order classification, a clear sight triangle should be designed to provide the driver of the entering vehicle with an unobstructed view to all points 4.5' above the roadway centerline in either direction.
5. Dead-End Streets.
a. Dead-end streets shall be classified as residential access streets in the street hierarchy and built according to those specifications.
b. A dead-end street shall not serve more than twenty (20) lots nor have a length greater than fifteen hundred (1500) feet. (See definition.)
c. Dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet, and a property line diameter of at least one hundred twenty (120) feet.
d. Consideration will be given to other forms of turnaround.
e. The interior portion of the turnaround shall note contain a landscaped island unless approved by the Board.
6. Future Connections.
Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are deemed necessary by the Planning Board, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. The Board may require a temporary turnaround to be constructed to the end of such a street pending its extension to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate

emergency vehicles. The turnaround shall be provided in part on easements over lots, and the Board may impose a condition that upon extension of the street, the turnaround shall be removed and replaced with landscaping. Alternatively, when the street is extended, the turnaround may remain and be improved if the Board determines that it will serve the convenience of the neighborhood.
E. Utilities
1. General.
a. Where adjacent property is not subdivided or where all the property of the applicant is not being subdivided at the same time, provisions shall be made for the extension of the utility system by continuing the mains the full length of streets and to the exterior limits of the subdivision at such grade and size which will, in the opinion of the Board, permit their proper extension at a later date.
b. Connections for sewer, drain, water, and gas services from the main structure in the way to the exterior line of the way shall be constructed for each lot whether or not there is a building thereon, except that the Board may waive such requirement, in whole or in part, in the case of a lot to be used for a park, playground or for any other purpose for which, in the opinion of the Board, such connections shall not be required.
c. All utilities shall have a minimum of four (4) feet of cover.
2. Utility Easements.
Easements for utilities across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary and shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet wide. Proper coordination shall be established between the applicant and utility companies for the establishment of utility easements in adjoining properties.

G. Protection of Natural Features
All natural features, such as trees, wooded area, water courses, scenic points and historic spots, shall be preserved as much as possible. Any clearing, backfilling, cutting, thinning or other disturbance to trees twelve (12) inches in diameter at breast height located within the minimum front setback distance or other natural vegetation shall be prohibited unless deemed proper by the Board. Tree wells or retaining walls should be installed when and as requested by the Board for suitable grading around trees.
H. Storm Drainage Systems
1. General Approach.
Storm drains, culverts, swales, detention basins, and related facilities shall be designed to permit the unimpeded flow of all natural Water courses, to ensure adequate drainage at all low points along streets, to safely dispose of runoff at all times during and after construction, to control erosion, and to intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area being drained. Where determined to be appropriate by the Board, stormwater may be carried on the surface of the ground and recharged rather than piped to surface water. No drainage system which will cause siltation or pollution of any wetland, stream, brook, lake, river, or pond is acceptable.
2. Standards.
a. Facility design shall accommodate, as a minimum, the following standards; stricter standards may be required by the Board in high risk areas:
Storm sewers and swales 25 year storm
Detention Basin. 25 year storm
Culverts, other stream crossings 50 year storm
b. Peak stream flows and runoff at the boundaries of the subdivision in a twenty-five (25) year storm shall be no higher following development than prior to development, unless authorized by the Board after a determination that the receiving wetlands or water bodies may absorb the increase, or that provision of detention capacity is sufficient.
3. Connections.
Proper connection shall be made with any existing drains in the adjacent streets or easements which are found to be adequate to accommodate the drainage flow from the subdivision. A drainage connection permit shall be obtained from the Webster Department of Public Works prior to connecting into an existing drain.
4. Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas.
The Board shall consider the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff from the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, or decrease natural drainage conditions, the Board may withhold its approval until provision has been made for the improvement in such sum as the Board shall determine. No discharge of runoff onto property of others shall be allowed unless documentation is provided demonstrating authorization from the property owners involved.

5. Projection to Unsubdivided Areas.
Where property adjacent to a subdivision and in the same drainage area is not subdivided, provisions shall be made for proper projection of the drainage system by continuing appropriate drains and easements to the exterior boundaries of the subdivision at such size and grade as will allow for such projection.
6. Lot Drainage.
Lots shall be prepared and graded in such a manner that development of one lot shall not affect drainage on another lot or onto streets. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of stormwater from one lot to the adjacent lots.
7. Drainage Easements
a. Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream, the Definitive Plan shall show such, and the Board may that there be provided a perpetual water easement or drainage right-of-way of adequate width to conform substantially to the lines of such water course, drainage way, channel, or stream, and to provide for construction or other necessary purposes. The side slope shall not be steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical.

Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural water course or to other drainage facilities.
c. Drainage easements shall be indicated on the Definitive Plan and shall be transferred to the Town upon acceptance of the public ways. Until such acceptance, the subdivider shall be responsible for maintenance of all drainage facilities.
d. Where a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the Definitive Plan.
8. Detention Basins.
a. Detention facilities shall accommodate site runoff generated from 2-year, 10-year, and 25-year storms considered individually. Detention shall be provided such that after development the peak rate of flow from the site will not exceed the corresponding flow which would have been created by similar storms prior to development.
b. To minimize the chance of clogging and to facilitate cleaning, outlet pipes shall be provided and shall be at least six (6) inches in diameter. Riser pipes, if utilized, shall be at least eight (8) inches in diameter. All pipe joints are to be watertight, reinforced concrete pipe. Trash racks and/or anti-vortex devices shall be required where necessary. Detention basins should be designed so that no permanent pool of water is established.
