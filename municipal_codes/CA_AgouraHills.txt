PREFACE 
The Agoura Hills Municipal Code constitutes the first Code of Ordinances for the City of Agoura Hills, California, incorporated in 1982. 
The text of the Code as originally adopted in 81/2 by 11 page form was produced on a word processor in the office of the city attorney. Subsequent ordinances were drafted in the form of amendments to that original document and were inserted in their places by the office of the city clerk. In 1987, the city contracted with Municipal Code Corporation to edit the code and ordinances into a uniform document, index it thoroughly, and typeset it in double column format. The resulting pages were printed and bound in looseleaf binders. 
The Code is arranged in articles that cover broad subject areas such as administration, public safety, business, building, and zoning. Within the articles, chapters contain specific regulations on more specialized topics such as council meetings, fire codes, and individual businesses. Related sections that are physically separated have been tied together through the extensive use of cross references in eight-point type on text pages and by a comprehensive topical index. 
The ordinances that have been included in the Code are listed in the Code Comparative Table, which precedes the index. The table lists all ordinances that have at any time affected the text of the Code. If an ordinance amends a specific subsection, the table lists that subsection. 
The physical format of the Code is designed to allow easy supplementation. For instance, pages have been reserved at the ends of chapters and articles to allow new legislation to be inserted. It is hoped that timely supplements will allow the city to keep its Code as up-to-date as possible. 
Any publication is a joint effort. In this case, the publisher would like to extend its thanks to the offices of the city clerk/manager and the city attorney. Their diligent efforts made the publication process go smoothly and efficiently, resulting in a Code that should prove to be a useful tool in the administration of the day-to-day affairs of the city.

(c)  Public nuisances. In addition to the penalties hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code shall be deemed a public nuisance and may, by this city, be summarily abated as such, and every day such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 105, 6-3-86) 
1201. - Violation of administrative provisions. 
    The violation of any administrative provision of this Code by any officer or employee of the city may be deemed a failure to perform the duties under or observe the rules and regulations of the department, office or board within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the city. 
1202. - Penalties and arrests for violation of this Code and other city ordinances. 
(a)  Notice to appear. In any case in which a person is arrested for an offense declared by this Code to be a misdemeanor and does not demand to be taken before a magistrate, such person may, instead of being taken before a magistrate, be released according to the procedures set forth by this section. If the arresting officer or his superior determines that the person should be released, such officer or superior shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court, containing the name and address of such person, the offense charged, and the time and place where and when such person shall appear in court. If a person is not released prior to being booked and the officer in charge of the booking or his superior determines that the person should be released, such officer or superior shall prepare such written notice to appear in court. 
(b)  Time specified. Unless waived by the person, the time specified in the notice to appear must be at least five (5) days after arrest. 
(c)  Place specified. The place specified in the notice shall be the court of the magistrate before whom the person would be taken if the requirement of taking an arrested person before a magistrate were complied with, or shall be an officer authorized by such court to receive a deposit of bail. 
(d)  Promise to appear. The officer shall deliver one (1) copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person; and the arrested person, in order to secure release, must give his written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
(e)  Bail. The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein. Thereupon the magistrate may fix the amount of bail which in his judgment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1275 of the Penal Code of California, will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant and shall endorse upon the notice a statement signed by him in the form set forth in Section 815a of the Penal Code. The defendant may, prior to the date upon which he promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant shall not appear, either in person or by counsel, the magistrate may declare the bail forfeited, and may in his discretion order that no further proceedings shall be had in such case. 
     Upon the making of such order that no further proceedings be had, all sums deposited as bail shall forthwith be paid into the county treasury for distribution pursuant to Section 1463 of the Penal Code. 
(f)  Warrants; failure to appear. No warrant shall issue on such charge for the arrest of a person who has given such written promise to appear in court, unless and until he has violated such promise or has failed to deposit bail, to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment, or to comply with the terms and provisions of the judgment, as required by law. 
     The officer shall indicate on the notice to appear whether he desires the arrested person to be booked as defined in subdivision 21 of Section 7 of the Penal Code. In such event, the magistrate shall, before the proceedings are finally concluded, order the defendant to be booked by the arresting agency. 
(g)  Application of this section. A peace officer may use the written notice to appear procedure set forth in this section for any misdemeanor offense for which the officer has arrested a person pursuant to Penal Code Section 836 or in which he has taken custody of a person pursuant to Penal Code Section 847. 
(h)  Release after booking. If the arrested person is not released pursuant to the provisions of this section prior to being booked by the arresting agency, then at the time of booking the arresting officer, the officer in charge of such booking or his superior officer, or any other person designated by the city or county for this purpose, shall make an immediate investigation into the background of the person to determine whether he should be released pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such investigation shall include, but need not be limited to, the person's name, address, length of residence at the address, length of residence within this state, marital and family status, employment, length of that employment, prior arrest record, and such other facts relating to the person's arrest which would bear on the question of his release pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(i)  Authority. The provisions of this section except this subsection (i) hereof have been enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 853.6 of the Penal Code of the State of California.

ARTICLE II - ADMINISTRATION 
Chapter 1 - CITY MANAGER 

2100. - Office of the city manager created. 
    The office of the city manager of the City of Agoura Hills is hereby created and established. The city manager shall be appointed by the council solely on the basis of executive and administrative qualifications and ability and shall hold office at and during the pleasure of the council.

(Ord. No. 09-368, § 1, 8-26-09) 
2102. - Absence of city manager. 
    In case of the absence or disability of the city manager, the city council may designate some duly qualified person to perform the duties of the city manager during the period of absence or disability of said city manager. 
2103. - Removal of city manager. 
    The council shall appoint the city manager for an indefinite term and may only remove the city manager by three (3) members voting affirmatively for such removal. At least thirty (30) days before such removal shall become effective, the council shall, by three (3) members voting for its adoption, adopt a resolution stating the reason for the city manager's removal. By the resolution the council may suspend the city manager from duty but shall in any case cause to be paid to him or her forthwith any unpaid balance of his or her monthly salary, and his or her monthly salary shall continue to be paid for the next calendar month following adoption of the preliminary resolution. The council, in removing the city manager, shall use its uncontrolled discretion, and its action shall be final and shall not depend upon any particular showing or degree of proof at the hearing, the purpose of which is to allow the city manager publicly to present to the council his or her grounds of opposition to removal prior to its action. 
2104. - Removal after municipal election. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the city manager shall not be removed from office nor may the notice provided for in section 2103 be sent to the city manager during or within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days next succeeding any general municipal election held in the city at which election a member of the council is elected. The purpose of the provisions of this section is to allow any newly elected member of the council or a reorganized council to observe the actions and ability of the city manager in the performance of the powers and duties of the office. After the expiration of such one-hundred-eighty-day period, the provisions of section 2103 of this chapter shall apply and be effective. 
2105. - Compensation; expenses. 
(a)  The city manager shall receive such compensation as the city council shall from time to time determine and fix, and said compensation shall be a proper charge against general funds of the city or as against such funds as may be indicated by the city council. 
(b)  The city manager shall be reimbursed for all sums necessarily incurred or paid by him or her in the performance of his or her duties, or incurred when traveling on business pertaining to the city under direction of the city council; reimbursement shall only be made, however, when a verified itemized claim setting forth the sums expended for which reimbursement is requested has been presented to the city council and by said city council duly approved and allowed. 
2106. - Bond. 
    At the city council's discretion, the city may post a corporate surety bond to be approved by the city council in such sum as may be approved by the city council, which shall be conditioned on the faithful performance of the duties imposed on the city manager, city clerk and city treasurer as herein prescribed. 
(Ord. No. 09-368, § 2, 8-26-09) 
2107. - Powers and duties. 
    The city manager shall be the administrative head of the city government under the direction and control of the city council, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The city manager shall be responsible for the efficient administration of all the affairs of the city which are under the city manager's control. In addition to the general duties and powers as administrative head, and not as a limitation thereon, it shall be the city manager's duty and the city manager shall have the power:

    The city manager shall inspect supplies and equipment delivered to determine their conformance with the specification set forth in the order or contract. The city manager shall have authority to require chemical and physical tests of samples submitted with bids and samples of deliveries which are necessary to determine their quality and conformance with specifications. 
(Ord. No. 55, 4-11-84; Ord. No. 111, 8-5-86) 
2706. - Local vendor deduction. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage businesses to locate and remain within the city and to encourage them to bid on contracts with the city. The intent of this section is to allow the bid amount of a local vendor, as defined in paragraph (b) below, to be discounted by the approximate amount that will return to the city through apportionment of the sale tax revenues derived from a sale within the city. By this deduction, the bid amount from a local vendor will more closely reflect the actual cost to the city of purchasing materials, equipment, and supplies from a local vendor. 
(b)  The amount of a bid submitted by a vendor located within the city and whose sales, for retail tax purposes, are recorded as derived within the city, shall be considered, for purposes of determining the lowest responsible bid, to be one (1) percent less than the actual bid amount. This one (1) percent local vendor bidding deduction shall apply only to contracts for supplies, materials, and merchandise which are subject to this chapter and which are subject to state and county sales taxes. This deduction shall be used only for comparison of bid prices. Other than this local vendor deduction, all other factors in determining lowest responsible bidder shall apply in awarding contracts pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 182, § 2, 3-27-91) 
2707. - Service contracts. 
    This chapter applies to service contracts for the installation of supplies and equipment for the city. This chapter does not apply to contracts for professional services. The city manager or any person acting pursuant to written authorization of the city manager may enter into contracts for professional services in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or less without prior approval of the council and without solicitation of formal or informal bids. Contracts for professional services in an amount in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) shall be subject to prior approval of the council but may be entered into without solicitation of formal or informal bids.

    This chapter of the Agoura Hills Municipal Code may be referred to as the "Campaign Reform Ordinance" of the City of Agoura Hills. 
(Ord. No. 163 & 163U, § 1, 7-12-89) 
21001. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is: 
(a)  To require full disclosure of the identity of all contributors to campaigns in support of or in opposition to candidates for the city council and city ballot measures; 
(b)  To eliminate the possibility of corruption or any appearance of corruption in local elections by limiting the amounts of money any person may contribute, or otherwise cause to be available, to candidates for the city council, and by prohibiting cash contributions as a means of avoiding disclosure; 
(c)  Pursuant to California Government Code Section 85706, to impose contribution limitations, disclosure requirements, and prohibitions that are as or more stringent than those imposed by state law; and 
(d)  To fully implement the provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1996, passed by the voters as Proposition 208 at the November 5, 1996 statewide election. 
(Ord. No. 163 & 163U, § 1, 7-12-89; Ord. No. 97-273U, § 2, 4-16-97) 
21002. - Definitions. 
    The definitions set forth in the Political Reform Act of 1974, as amended (Government Code Sections 82000 through 82055), shall govern the interpretation of this chapter, except that: 
(a)  "City ballot measure" shall mean any initiative, referendum or city council-sponsored measure that is to be submitted solely to the voters of the City of Agoura Hills; and 
(b)  "Committee" shall mean any person or combination of persons who directly or indirectly does any of the following: 
(1)  Receives contributions totaling two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or more in a calendar year; or 
(2)  Makes independent expenditures totaling two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or more in a calendar year; or 
(3)  Makes contributions totaling more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in a calendar year to or at the behest of any candidate or candidates for city council, any controlled committee or committees of such candidate or candidates, and any committee which supports or opposes such candidate or candidates. 
A person or combination of persons that becomes a committee shall retain its status as a committee until such time as that status is terminated pursuant to Section 84214 of the California Government Code. 
The provisions of this subsection (b) shall apply only to committees which receive contributions or make independent expenditures to support or oppose a city ballot measure or a candidate for city council. The definition of committee contained in the Political Reform Act (California Government Code Section 82013) shall apply to all other committees that are engaged in activities not in support of or in opposition to a city ballot measure or a candidate for city council. 
(c)  "Candidate" shall mean an individual who is listed on the ballot or who has qualified to have write-in votes on his or her behalf counted by election officials for nomination or election to the city council, or who receives a contribution or makes an expenditure or gives his or her consent for any other person to receive a contribution or make an expenditure with a view to bringing about his or her nomination or election to the city council, whether or not he or she has announced his or her candidacy or filed a declaration of candidacy at such time. "Candidate" also includes any member of the city council who is the subject of a recall effort. For the purpose of this chapter, a member of the city council becomes the subject of a recall effort, and therefore becomes a candidate, at such time as the notice of intention to circulate petitions is served on that member. Thereafter, any action taken by a person to advocate the recall of the candidate shall be deemed to be opposing the candidate, and any action taken by a person to oppose the recall of the candidate shall be deemed to be supporting the candidate. An individual who becomes a candidate shall retain his or her status as a candidate until such time as that status is terminated pursuant to Section 84214 of the California Government Code. "Candidate" does not include any person within the meaning of Section 301(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. 
(Ord. No. 163 and 163U, § 1, 7-12-89; Ord. No. 179, § 1, 1-9-91; Ord. No. 97-273U, § 3, 4-16-97; Ord. No. 99-294, §§ 2-4, 2-10-99) 
21003. - Campaign contribution limitations. 
(a)  No person or committee shall make to any candidate, including the controlled committee of such candidate, and no such candidate or such candidate's controlled committee shall solicit or accept any contribution that will cause the amount contributed by the contributor to the candidate or the candidate's controlled committee to exceed two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for any single election. In the event that any California statute applicable to general law cities imposes any contribution limit, the lower dollar amount limit of the two shall control. 
(b)  No person shall make to any committee which supports or opposes any candidate or candidates for city council and no such committee shall accept from any such person a contribution or contributions totaling more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for any single election. In the event that any California statute applicable to general law cities imposes any contribution limit, the lower dollar amount limit of the two shall control.

(d)  No person shall make to any candidate for city council or the candidate's controlled committee, or to any committee primarily formed to support or oppose any such candidate or candidates, and no such candidate or committee shall solicit or accept any anonymous contribution in excess of five dollars ($5.00). 
(e)  No contribution which causes the total amount contributed to a candidate for city council or the candidate's controlled committee, or to any committee primarily formed to support or oppose any such candidate or candidates, by the person making the contribution to exceed five dollars ($5.00) for a single election for member of the city council shall be deposited into a campaign checking account unless the name, address, occupation, and employer of the contributor are on file with the committee receiving the contribution. 
(f)  No person shall make to any candidate for city council or such candidate's controlled committee, or to any committee primarily formed to support or oppose any such candidate or candidates, and no such candidate or committee shall solicit or accept any contribution during the period between seven (7) calendar days before the date of the election and the closing of the polls on election day. 
(g)  No person shall contribute more than the local aggregate contribution limit to all candidates for the city council, their controlled committees, and committees which support or oppose such a candidate or candidates in connection with any election for member or members of the city council. For the purpose of this subsection (g), the local aggregate contribution limit shall be calculated by multiplying two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) by the number of members of the city council to be elected at that election, and adding two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to that resulting amount. The limitation of this subsection (g) shall not apply to contributions to any officeholder account. 
(h)  No candidate and no committee controlled by a candidate shall make any contribution to any other candidate, any committee that supports or opposes candidates, or any committee that supports or opposes one or more city ballot measures. This section shall not prohibit a candidate from making a contribution from his or her own personal funds to his or her own candidacy, or to another candidate or committee subject to the limits, disclosure and record-keeping requirements imposed by this chapter. 
(i)  Contributions shall be aggregated and, hence, treated as though made by the same person, when made by: 
(1)  Entities which share a majority of members on their boards of directors, unless such entities in fact act independently in their decisions to make contributions; 
(2)  Entities which share two or more officers, unless such entities in fact act independently in their decisions to make contributions; 
(3)  Entities which are in a parent-subsidiary relationship, or where one entity is a branch, division, affiliate, department or local unit of the other; 
(4)  An individual or group of individuals and any legal entity or entities in which the individual or group of individuals own greater than fifty (50) percent of the voting or other class of stock of the entity, or who receive or are entitled to receive greater than fifty (50) percent of the profits of the entity; 
(5)  An individual and any other legal entity or entities for which the individual is in fact solely responsible for decisions regarding the making of contributions; or 
(6)  Employees, agents or representatives of an individual or entity including, without limitation, a committee, together with that individual or entity, when the contribution is directed by, reimbursed by, or made at the request or behest of that individual or entity. 
(j)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to a candidate's contribution of his or her personal funds to his or her own campaign committee, but shall apply to contributions from a spouse. 
(k)  No committee shall make a contribution or independent expenditure to support or oppose a candidate if that committee has received a contribution from any person that exceeded, or caused the cumulative amount the committee received from that person to exceed, two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) in the twelve (12) calendar months immediately prior to the date the committee's contribution or independent expenditure is made. This section shall not prohibit a committee that otherwise receives contributions in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) from making such contributions or independent expenditures if the funds are expended from a separate account funded entirely by contributions of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or less. 
(Ord. No. 163 & 163U, § 1, 7-12-89; Ord. No. 97-273U, § 4, 4-16-97; Ord. No. 99-294, §§ 5-9, 2-10-99; Ord. No. 03-316, §§ 3-5, 2-26-2003) 
21004. - Restrictions on when contributions may be received. 
(a)  No candidate, including the candidate's controlled committee, and no committee primarily formed to support or oppose any such candidate or candidates, shall accept any contributions more than six (6) calendar months prior to any election in which the candidate is attempting, or has qualified, to be on the ballot or is a write-in candidate. In the case of a recall effort, the pre-election fund raising period set forth in this paragraph shall commence on the date a notice of intent to circulate a recall petition is served on the officer. 
(b)  No candidate or the controlled committee of such candidate, and no committee primarily formed to support or oppose any candidate or candidates, shall accept any contributions after the earlier of: (i) ninety (90) days after the date of the candidate's withdrawal as a candidate, defeat or election to office; or (ii) the date on which outstanding bills or debts owed by the candidate or committee are paid in full. Contributions received during such ninety (90) day period shall be used only to pay outstanding bills or debts owed by the candidate or committee for that election. The limitations of this paragraph shall not apply to funds raised by a candidate or the candidate's controlled committee to retire outstanding debts from any election for city elective office held prior to the effective date of this section, provided that such funds are collected pursuant to the contribution limits established in this chapter. Such funds raised to retire debts remaining from elections held prior to the effective date of this section shall not count against the single election contribution limits established in this chapter. 
(c)  If, at the end of the period specified in subsection (b) above, there remains any unexpended balance in the campaign bank account of any candidate or committee, such unexpended funds remaining in the account shall be immediately disposed of in the following manner: 
(1)  Subject to the limitations in section 21005, funds may be transferred from the candidate's campaign account to the candidate's officeholder account, if such an account is permitted to be established by this chapter. 
(2)  Any remaining unexpended funds shall be returned to contributors pro rata, turned over to the General Fund of the City of Agoura Hills, or donated to any bona fide charitable, educational, civic, religious, or similar tax exempt, non-profit organization, where no substantial part of the donation will have a material financial effect on the former candidate, any member of his or her immediate family, or his or her campaign treasurer. 
(d)  Under no circumstances shall funds raised for a campaign for city elective office be redesignated, transferred, or used for any future election other than the single election for which the funds were contributed. 
(Ord. No. 99-294, § 11, 2-10-99) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 99-294, § 10, adopted Feb. 10, 1999, renumbered the former §§ 21004-21008 as §§ 21006-21010, respectively. Sections 11 and 12 then added new §§ 21004 and 21005 as set out herein. 
21005. - Officeholder accounts. 
(a)  Each member of the city council may establish one segregated officeholder account for expenses directly related to assisting, serving, or communicating with constituents, or to carrying out the official duties of the elected officer, provided aggregate contributions to such an account do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in any calendar year, and provided further that the balance of funds in such an account that are accrued from contributions does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) at any time.

Chapter 11 - PUBLIC PROJECTS 

21100. - Intent. 
    The intent of this chapter is to provide standardized procedures for awarding contracts for public projects in conformance with the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act. Nothing in this chapter is intended to require the City to solicit bids for equipment, supplies or services or accept the lowest bid to provide equipment, supplies or services, except as required by state law and chapter 7 of article II of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21101. - Definitions. 
    Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions shall govern the construction of this chapter: 
    Change order shall mean a written authorization from the city directing an addition, deletion, or revision to an awarded purchase order or contract. 
    Public project shall be defined as that term is defined in Section 22002 of the California Public Contract Code, or any successor statute thereto. 
    Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act shall mean the procedures and regulations set forth in Chapter 2, commencing with Section 22000, to Part 3 of Division 2 of the California Public Contract Code or any successor act thereto. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21102. - Applicability. 
    All public projects shall be bid and let to contract in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, or any successor act thereto, and the provisions set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21103. - Purchase order required. 
    In order to comply with the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act procedures set forth in the California Public Contract Code and to more efficiently manage all contracts for public projects, the city shall issue a purchase order to accompany every contract for the performance of services or public projects. No contract shall be deemed to be an authorization to proceed with work unless accompanied by a properly authorized and executed purchase order. No vendor or contracting party is authorized to perform any service, perform any public project, or provide any supplies or equipment without first receiving a properly authorized and executed purchase order. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21104. - Bid requirements, purchasing procedures, and contracting procedures. 
    This section shall govern the procedures for bidding and awarding all purchase orders and contracts to perform public projects, including any associated purchase of goods and supplies for such projects. Bidding requirements and other purchasing and contracting procedures are categorized into three (3) different levels set forth below. Each level shall govern purchases and contracts of different values. Level 1 shall govern the least expensive purchase orders and contracts and level 3 shall govern the most expensive purchase orders and contracts. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the bidding and other procedures for awarding public project contracts shall not violate the limitations of the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, as they may be amended from time to time by the state controller or the state legislature. 
(a)  Level 1 projects. Public projects of forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000.00) or less may be performed by city employees by force account or may be awarded by negotiated contract or by purchase order by the city manager or his/her designee without competitive bidding. 
(b)  Level 2 projects. Public projects of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000.00) or less may be let to contract by the informal bid procedures set forth in this subsection. Contracts that are authorized to be awarded pursuant to level 2 procedures may be awarded by the city manager or his/her designee. All level 2 contracts shall require competitive verbal or written bidding, as described below in this subsection (b). The city manager or his/her designee shall determine whether a competitive verbal or written bidding procedure for a public project is in the best interest of the city. If the city manager or his/her designee determines that a competitive verbal bidding procedure is in the best interest of the city, the city may solicit verbal bids as provided pursuant to subsection (1) below. Otherwise, the city shall require competitive written bids as provided in this subsection (2) below: 
(1)  Verbal bids. 
(i)  Bids shall be verbally solicited from a minimum of three (3) sources and may be received verbally. The person who solicits the bids shall prepare a memorandum to the file documenting the identity of the bidders and the amount of the bids that were obtained. 
(ii)  The city manager or his/her designee shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder only if he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the city. The city manager or his/her designee may reject all bids, or waive any irregularities or informalities in any bid or bidding. 
(iii)  The city manager or his/her designee may waive the requirement to verbally solicit bids if performance of the public project is available from only one (1) source and may solicit only two (2) bids if performance of the public project is available from only two (2) sources. 
(2)  Written bids. 
(i)  Bid specifications shall be prepared and written notices soliciting written bids shall be disseminated to a list of at least three (3) prospective bidders. Such notices shall include the closing date of the bid. 
(ii)  Bids shall be submitted in writing and must be received prior to the bid closing date to be considered. 
(iii)  The city manager or his/her designee shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder only if he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of the city. The city manager or his/her designee may reject all bids, or waive any irregularities or informalities in any bid or bidding. 
(iv)  The city manager or his/her designee may waive the requirement to solicit bids if performance of the public project is available from only one (1) source and may solicit only two (2) bids if performance of the public project is available from only two (2) sources. 
(3)  Contractors list. The city shall develop and maintain a list of contractors, identified according to categories of work, in accordance with the provisions of Section 22034 of the California Public Contract Code, or any successor statute thereto, and the criteria promulgated from time to time by the California Uniform Construction Costs Accounting Commission. 
(4)  Notice inviting formal bids. At least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date informal bids are due, the city shall mail a notice inviting informal bids to all contractors from the applicable category of work to be bid, as shown on the contractors list developed in accordance with subsection (3) of this subsection (b), and to all construction trade journals as specified by the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission in accordance with Section 22036 of the California Public Contract Code, or any successor statute thereto. Said notice shall describe the project in general terms, shall clearly indicate how to obtain more detailed information about the project, and shall set forth the time and place for the submission of bids. 
(5)  Excess bids. If all bids received pursuant to the procedures outlined in this subsection (b) are in excess of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000.00), the city council may, by passage of a resolution by a four-fifths ( 4/5 ) vote, award the contract at one hundred eighty-seven thousand five hundred dollars ($187,500.00) or less, to the lowest responsible bidder, without complying with the bidding procedures set forth in subsection (c) below, provided that the council determines that the cost estimate of the project was reasonable. 
(c)  Level 3 projects. Public projects of more than one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000.00) shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be let to contract by the formal bidding procedures set forth in this subsection (c). Public projects which must be let pursuant to level 3 procedures shall be approved by the city council and shall require competitive written bidding, as described below in this subsection (c). 
(1)  Bid specifications. For all public projects that must be let pursuant to level 3 procedures, bid specifications shall be prepared, and notices inviting sealed bids shall be disseminated to at least three (3) prospective bidders approved by the city manager. In addition, bid plans and working details shall be formally adopted by the city council for all public projects in accordance with the requirements of Section 22039 of the Public Contract Code or any successor statute.

(3)  Receipt of bids. Bids shall be sealed, and shall not be opened until the time and place designated in the bid specifications. Bids must be received prior to the bid opening to be considered. 
(4)  The city council shall award the bid to the lowest responsible bidder, or reject all bids pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 22038, or its successor statute. The city council may waive any irregularities or informalities in any bid or bidding. 
(5)  The city council may waive the procedures required by this subsection (d) if the city council determines that performance of the public project is available only from a single source and may send a notice inviting bids to only two (2) prospective bidders if the city council determines that performance of the public project is available from only two (2) sources. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21105. - Unauthorized purchases and contracts. 
    It shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, or agent of the city to contract for the performance of public projects, or otherwise make any contract in violation of this chapter. Any order, purchase, or contract made contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall not be binding on the city, and the city shall not be obligated thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21106. - Prohibition against splitting projects.

(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21107. - Bid security. 
    Bid security shall be required as a condition of submitting a written bid unless deemed unnecessary by the city manager or his/her designee. 
    If a bidder is awarded a bid and then fails or refuses to execute a contract or purchase order with the city, the city may award the bid to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the bid is awarded to the next lowest responsible bidder under these circumstances, the amount of the lower bidder's bid security shall be applied by the city to the purchase or contract price differential between that bidder and the next lowest responsible bidder, and the remainder, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21108. - Emergency procurement. 
    In addition to any other exemption from bidding requirements set forth in this chapter or otherwise provided by law, if an emergency situation requires that a public facility be repaired or replaced to permit the continued conduct of the operation or services of the city or to avoid danger to life or property, the city council may proceed to replace or repair the facility in accordance with the provisions of Section 22035 of the California Public Contract Code or any successor statute thereto. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21109. - Interpretation of bid specifications. 
    If a prospective bidder discovers discrepancies or omissions in any specification, or if the bidder is in doubt as to the meaning of any specification, the bidder shall request a written interpretation or modification from the city. If interpretations or modifications are deemed necessary, the city will then issue a written addendum to all parties known to have received copies of the specifications. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21110. - Change orders. 
    Any alteration to, amendment of, or deviation from an awarded purchase order or contract as to scope, cost, time for completion, material, or equipment furnished as a part of the purchase order or contract, or any alteration to, amendment of, or deviation from the nature of work to be performed, shall require the completion and issuance of a change order. Additions to work cannot be combined with deletions to work to avoid the change order requirement. 
    The change order shall be approved by the person or body that, pursuant to section 21104, would have authority to approve a purchase for the combined amount of the original purchase order and the change order. No change order shall be binding on the city until approved as provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 14-411, § 1, 12-10-2014) 
21111. - Protest procedures.

3700. - Intent. 
    The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. The flood hazard areas of the City of Agoura Hills are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. These flood losses are often caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. 
(Ord. No. 140, § 1, 2-24-88; Ord. No. 17-430, § 2, 8-23-2017) 
3701. - Scope. 
    This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Agoura Hills. The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study for the City of Agoura Hills" dated March 4, 1986, revised December 18, 1986, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This flood insurance study is on file at the Agoura Hills City Hall. This flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended by the floodplain administrator.

3702. - Purposes. 
    The purposes of this chapter include the following: 
(a)  To protect human life and health; 
(b)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects, and to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(c)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(d)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(e)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(f)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area and to ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions; 
(g)  To restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(h)  To require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(i)  To control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(j)  To control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(k)  To prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

(ee)  Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, include: any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are necessary to assure safe living conditions; nor any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
(ff)  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter.

Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. A structure or other development for which an elevation certificate, other required certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter, is not presented to the city is presumed to be in violation until such documentation is provided to the city. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Agoura Hills from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(b)  Applicability. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where this chapter and another provision of law, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, the most restrictive provisions shall prevail. 
(c)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(d)  Designation of the floodplain administrator . The city engineer shall have the duty to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter as the floodplain administrator. 
(e)  Warning and disclaimer of liability . The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Agoura Hills, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(f)  Severability . This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 140, § 1, 2-24-88; Ord. No. 06-336, § 1, 8-9-2006; Ord. No. 17-430, § 2, 8-23-2017) 
3705. - Development permit required. 
    A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development, including construction of manufactured homes, begins within any special flood hazard areas. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and the information provided shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(a)  Plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question and location of existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, existing and proposed locations of water lines, sanitary sewer and other utilities, and location of the regulatory floodway (when applicable) 
(b)  Base flood elevation information as specified in section 3706(d); 
(c)  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor of all structures; 
(d)  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be floodproofed; 
(e)  All appropriate certifications listed in section 3706(f); and 
(f)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 140, § 1, 2-24-88; Ord. No. 17-430, § 2, 8-23-2017) 
3706. - Duties of the floodplain administrator. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(a)  Issue or deny development permits consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Review all applications and development permits to determine whether: 
(1)  The requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
(2)  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
(3)  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
(4)  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined, but the floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this section, "adversely affect" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the city. 
(5)  All letters of map revision, if necessary, for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. 
(c)  Using applicable Federal Emergency Management Authority guidance, develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining market value. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
(d)  Use other base flood data if appropriate in order to administer section 3707. If base flood elevation data is not provided in accordance with section 3704, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer section 3707. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
(e)  Take the following steps when a watercourse is to be altered or relocated: 
(1)  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; 
(2)  Require that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
(f)  Obtain and maintain for public inspection the following: 
(1)  The certification required in section 3707(a)(3)a. (floor elevations); 
(2)  The certification required in section 3707(a)(3)b.iii. (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
(3)  The certification required in section 3707(a)(3)c. (wet floodproofing standard); 
(4)  The certified elevation required in section 3707(c)(2) (subdivision standards); 
(5)  The certification required in section 3707(e)(1) (floodway encroachments); 
(g)  Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in section 3708. 
(h)  Enforce the provisions of this chapter by requiring that property comply with applicable floodplain management regulations. 
(i)  When base flood elevations change due to physical alterations, the floodplain administrator shall, within 6 months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to the Federal Emergency Management Authority for a letter of map revision. Submission of information are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. Building permits will not be issued based on conditional letters of map revisions. Approved conditional letters of map revisions allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
(j)  Notify the Federal Emergency Management Authority in writing whenever the city's geographic limits have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map clearly delineating the new geographic limits. 
(Ord. No. 140, § 1, 2-24-88; Ord. No. 17-430, § 2, 8-23-2017) 
3707. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  Standards for construction. In all special flood hazard areas the following standards are required: 
(1)  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of section 3707(d). 
(2)  Construction materials and methods. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(3)  Elevation and floodproofing. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with section 3707(a)(3)a. or, including attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must meet the following standards: 
(i)  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
(ii)  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
(iii)  Provide certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
c.  For all new construction and substantial improvements, it is required that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(i)  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or 
(ii)  Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in section 3707(d). 
(4)  Construction below lowest floor. The space below the lowest floor of a structure located in an SFHA may be used only for parking, temporary storage, or access. 
(b)  Standards for utilities. 
(1)  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from systems into floodwaters. 
(2)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(c)  Standards for subdivisions. 
(1)  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(2)  All final subdivision plans shall provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood, the final pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(5)  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(d)  Standards for manufactured homes. All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to manufactured homes shall: 
(1)  Be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; and 
(2)  Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. 
(e)  Standards for floodways. The following standards shall apply to floodways: 
(1)  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. If no floodway sources are designated, the registered professional engineer or architect shall demonstrate that the cumulative effect of all encroachment in the floodplain does not increase the base flood elevation (BFE) by more than one (1) foot. 
(2)  If section 3707(e)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 3707. 
(Ord. No. 140, § 1, 2-24-88; Ord. No. 01-307, §§ 2, 3, 5-23-2001; Ord. No. 17-430, § 2, 8-23-2017) 
3708. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Appeal of floodplain administrator decision and exceptions . The city council shall hear and decide appeals from the decision of the floodplain administrator and requests for exception from the requirements of this chapter. Within fifteen (15) days of the decision of the floodplain administrator, a person may appeal such decision to the city council or apply for an exception from the requirements of this chapter by filing an application with the floodplain administrator. 
(b)  Review by city council . In ruling on an application for an exception or an appeal, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and other relevant factors including the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and the floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The provision of access to the property during a flood for emergency and other vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(c)  Grounds for granting exceptions . 
(1)  Exceptions may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the exception is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(2)  Exceptions shall not be granted within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Generally, exceptions may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the exception increases. 
(4)  The city council shall make the following findings before granting an exception: 
a.  That there is a showing of good and sufficient cause for such exception; 
b.  That failure to grant the exception would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  That the granting of an exception will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation of a nuisance, or conflict with existing local laws. 
d.  The exception is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. 
(5)  Exceptions may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary to conduct a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of section 3708(b) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom an exception is granted shall be given written notice that the structure or other development will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation, will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation, and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Los Angeles County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(d)  Upon consideration of the factors in section 3708(b) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of exceptions and issuance of development permits as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(e)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any exceptions to the Federal Emergency Management Authority upon request and as part of the city's biennial report.

The citation shall state the amount of the parking penalty and the address of the agent authorized to receive deposit of the parking penalty. 
The parking citation shall also set forth the vehicle license number and registration expiration date, if such date is visible; the last four (4) digits of the vehicle identification number, if that number is visible through the windshield; the color of the vehicle; and, if discernable, the make of the vehicle. 
(b)  The parking citation, or copy thereof, shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of business of the issuing agency and the processing agency, and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. 
(c)  Once the parking citation is prepared and attached to the vehicle pursuant to subsection (a) above, the issuing officer shall file notice of the parking violation with the processing agency. 
(d)  If during issuance of the parking citation, without regard to whether the vehicle was initially attended or unattended, the vehicle is driven away prior to attaching the parking citation to the vehicle, the issuing officer shall file the notice with the processing agency. The processing agency shall mail, within fifteen (15) days of issuance of the parking citation, a copy of the parking citation to the registered owner at the address reflected in the records of the department. 
(e)  If after a copy of the parking citation is attached to the vehicle, or personally given to the operator, the issuing agency or the issuing officer determines that the issuing officer was in error in issuing the parking citation, the issuing officer or the issuing agency may recommend, in writing, that the parking citation be canceled. The recommendation shall state the reason or reasons for cancellation and shall be filed with the processing agency. 
Under no circumstance shall a personal relationship with any public official, officer, issuing officer, or law enforcement agency be grounds for cancellation. 
(f)  If a processing agency makes a finding that there are grounds for cancellation as set forth in the city's administrative policy, or pursuant to any other basis provided by law, then the finding or findings shall be filed with the processing agency, and the parking citation shall be canceled pursuant to subsection (1) of paragraph (a) of section 3812.

    The notice of delinquent parking violation shall contain the information required to be included in a parking citation pursuant to section 3804. The notice of delinquent parking violation shall also contain a notice to the registered owner that, unless the registered owner pays the parking penalty or contests the citation within ten (10) days after mailing the notice of delinquent parking violation or completes and files an affidavit of nonliability that complies with section 3810 or section 3811, the vehicle registration shall not be renewed until the parking penalties have been paid. In addition, the notice of delinquent parking violation shall contain, or be accompanied by, an affidavit of nonliability and information concerning what constitutes nonliability, information as to the effect of executing an affidavit, and instructions for returning the affidavit to the issuing agency.

Until the issuing or processing agency complies with a request to provide a copy of the parking citation, the processing agency may not proceed to immobilize the vehicle in question merely because the registered owner has received five (5) or more outstanding parking violations over a period of five (5) or more days. 
(b)  If the description of the vehicle on the parking citation does not substantially match the corresponding information on the registration card for that vehicle the processing agency shall, on written request of the operator, cancel the notice of parking violation.

The processing agency shall serve or mail to the renter or lessee identified in the affidavit of nonliability a notice of delinquent parking violation. The processing agency shall inform the renter or lessee that he or she must pay the full amount of the fine, or provide notice to the processing agency that he or she intends to contest the parking citation pursuant to section 3812 within fifteen (15) days of the mailing of the notice of delinquent parking violation. If the processing agency does not receive payment of the parking citation or does not receive notice of an intent to contest within fifteen (15) days, the processing agency may proceed against the renter or lessee pursuant to section 3813. 
(Ord. No. 93-243, § 2, 11-17-93)

The processing agency shall obtain verification from the department that the former owner has complied with the requirements necessary to release the former owner from liability pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 5602 or the successor statute thereto. 
    If the registered owner has complied with California Vehicle Code Section 5602, or the successor statute thereto, the processing agency shall cancel the notice of delinquent parking violation with respect to the registered owner.

(Ord. No. 93-243, § 2, 11-17-93) 
3812. - Contesting parking citation; procedure. 
(a)  If an operator or registered owner contests a parking citation or a notice of delinquent parking violation, the processing agency shall do all of the following: 
(1)  First, either investigate with its own records and staff or request that the issuing agency investigate the circumstances of the citation with respect to the contestant's written explanation of the reason or reasons for contesting the parking citation. 
If, based on the results of that investigation, the processing agency is satisfied that the violation did not occur, because the registered owner was not responsible for the violation by virtue of having sold, rented or leased the vehicle, or because legally supportable or mitigating circumstances as set forth in the city's administrative policy warrant a dismissal, the processing agency shall cancel the parking citation, and make an adequate record of the reason or reasons for canceling the parking citation. The processing agency shall mail the results of the investigation by first class mail to the contestant within ten (10) days of the decision. 
(2)  If the contestant is not satisfied with the results of the investigation provided for in subsection (1), the contestant may, within fifteen (15) days of the mailing of the results of the initial investigation, deposit the amount of the parking penalty or provide proof of an inability to deposit the parking penalty, and request an administrative hearing. 
(3)  If the contestant prevails at the administrative hearing, then the full amount of the parking penalty deposited shall be refunded. 
(b)  The administrative hearing procedure shall consist of the following: 
(1)  The contestant shall make a written request for administrative hearing on a form and in a manner satisfactory to the processing agency, and may request to contest the parking citation either in person or by written declaration. 
(2)  If the contestant is a minor, that person shall be permitted to appear at a hearing or admit responsibility for a parking citation without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may proceed against the minor in the same manner as if the minor were an adult. 
(3)  The administrative hearing shall be conducted before an examiner designated to conduct the hearing by the city council or by the processing agency. 
(c)  The issuing officer shall not be required to participate in an administrative hearing. The issuing agency shall not be required to produce any evidence other than the parking citation or copy thereof, and information received from the department identifying the registered owner of the vehicle. 
    This documentation in proper form shall be considered prima facie evidence of the violation. 
(d)  The processing agency's final decision shall be in writing and delivered personally to the contestant or the contestant's agent, or delivered by first class mail within ten (10) working days following the hearing. 
(e)  If the contestant is not the registered owner of the vehicle, all notices to the contestant required under this section shall also be given to the registered owner by first class mail. 
(Ord. No. 93-243, § 2, 11-17-93) 
3813. - Collection of unpaid parking penalties. 
    Except as otherwise provided below, the processing agency shall proceed under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), but not both, in order to collect an unpaid parking penalty: 
(a)  File an itemization of unpaid parking penalties and other related fees with the department for collection pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760 or the successor statute thereto. 
(b)  If more than four hundred dollars ($400.00) in unpaid parking penalties and other related fees have been accrued by any one registered owner or the registered owner's renter, lessee or sales transferee, proof thereof may be filed with the court which has the same effect as a civil judgment. Execution may be levied and such other measures may be taken for the collection of the judgment as are authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments entered against a defendant in an action against a debtor. 
The processing agency shall send notice by first-class mail to the registered owner or renter, lessee, or sales transferee indicating that a civil judgment has been filed and the date that the judgment shall become effective. The notice shall also indicate the time: that execution may be levied against that person's assets, that liens may be placed against that person's property, that the person's wages may be garnished, and that other steps may be taken to satisfy the judgment. The notice shall also state that the processing agency will terminate the commencement of a civil judgment proceeding if all parking penalties and other related fees are paid prior to the date set for hearing. If judgment is entered, then the city may file a writ of execution or an abstract with the court clerk's office identifying the means by which the civil judgment is to be satisfied. 
If a judgment is rendered for the processing agency, that agency may contract with a collection agency licensed pursuant to Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 6850) of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions Code, or the successor statutes thereto, to collect the judgment. 
The processing agency shall pay the established first paper civil filing fee at the time an entry of civil judgment is requested. 
(c)  If the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed for sixty (60) days beyond the renewal date, and the citation has not been collected by the department pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760, or the successor statute thereto, then the processing agency may file proof of unpaid penalties and fees with the court which has the same effect as a civil judgment as provided above in subsection (b). 
(d)  The processing agency shall not file a civil judgment with the court relating to a parking citation filed with the department unless the processing agency has determined that the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed for sixty (60) days beyond the renewal date and the citation has not been collected by the department pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760 or the successor statute thereto. 
(Ord. No. 93-243, § 2, 11-17-93) 
3814. - Obligation of processing agency once parking penalty paid. 
(a)  If the operator or registered owner served with notice of delinquent parking violation, or any other person who presents the parking citation or notice of delinquent parking violation, deposits the penalty with the person authorized to receive it, the processing agency shall do both of the following: 
(1)  Upon request, provide the operator, registered owner, or the registered owner's agent with a copy of the citation information presented in the notice of delinquent parking violation. The processing agency shall, in turn, obtain and record in its records the name, address and driver's license number of the person actually given the copy of the citation information. 
(2)  Determine whether the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the department or a civil judgment has been entered pursuant to section 3813. 
(b)  If the processing agency receives full payment of all parking penalties and other related fees and the processing agency has neither filed a notice of delinquent parking violation nor entered a civil judgment, then all proceedings for that citation shall cease. 
(c)  If the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the department and has been returned by the department pursuant to the provisions of the California Vehicle Code and payment of the parking penalty has been made, along with any other related fees, then the proceedings for that citation shall cease. 
(d)  If the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the department and has not been returned by the department, and payment of the parking penalty along with any other fees applied by either the department or the processing agency or both have been made, the processing agency shall do all of the following: 
(1)  Deliver a certificate of payment to the operator, or other person making payment; 
(2)  Within five (5) working days transmit payment information to the department in the manner prescribed by the department; 
(3)  Terminate proceedings on the notice of delinquent parking violation;

    All parking penalties collected, including process service fees and costs related to civil debt collection, shall be deposited to the account of the processing agency, and then remitted to the city, if the city is not also the processing agency. 
    If the city is not the processing agency, then the city shall enter into an agreement with the processing agency for periodic transfer of parking citation receipts, along with a report setting forth the number of cases processed and the sums received.

    The processing agency shall prepare an audited report at the end of each fiscal year setting forth the number of cases processed, and all sums received and distributed, together with any other information that may be specified by the city or its authorized issuing agency or the state controller. The report is a public record and shall be delivered to the city and its authorized issuing agency.

Chapter 12 - SOCIAL HOST ACCOUNTABILITY 

41200. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Social Host Accountability Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 06-341, § 1, 5-9-2007) 
41201. - Legislative purpose. 
    The purposes of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and to promote the reduction of underage drinking by imposing an administrative fine on persons responsible for unruly gatherings where alcohol is consumed by, served to or in the possession of underage persons. 
(Ord. No. 06-341, § 1, 5-9-2007) 
41202. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council finds as follows: 
(a)  The City of Agoura Hills, pursuant to the powers delegated to it by the California Constitution, has the authority to enact laws that promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents. 
(b)  The occurrence of unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a threat to the public health, safety, or quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare. Underage persons, who have been consuming alcoholic beverages, are at greater risk to be in automobile accidents, to commit suicide, to be assaulted, and females are at greater risk of sexual assaults. 
(c)  Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to, possession by, and/or consumption of alcohol by underage persons. Persons responsible for the occurrence of unruly gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings. 
(d)  Problems associated with gatherings involving underage persons drinking alcohol are difficult to prevent and deter. Public safety personnel need an arsenal of tools to deal with the issue of underage drinking and its attendant problems. If persons are held civilly responsible by having to pay a fine for hosting this type of gathering where there is underage drinking, they will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such conduct at events held on property under their possession or control. The city has the legal authority to issue an administrative citation for an administrative fine.

PART 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

5300. - Intent. 
    The city council hereby finds and determines, in order to meet the requirements of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, including requirements for source reduction of the solid waste stream, diversion of solid waste from landfills and conservation of natural resources, it is necessary to regulate the collection of solid waste from residential and commercial premises and to encourage recycling of solid waste materials. 
    The city council further finds and determines that the storage, accumulation, collection and disposal of solid waste, including without limitation garbage, trash, debris and other discarded materials is a matter of great public concern in that improper control of such matters may create a public nuisance, air pollution, fire hazard, rat and insect infestation and other problems affecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
    Regulation of the collection of garbage, refuse and other discarded materials from all residential and commercial properties within the city will provide the most orderly and efficient solution to such problems and promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
    Regulation of solid waste haulers' activities in the city will also promote public health and safety by, among other things, requiring newer and safer vehicles, regular maintenance, reduction of spillage and litter in the public streets, establishing accountability for the cleaning of refuse bins and containers, and accountability to the public. 
    The city council hereby finds and determines that the public health, safety and welfare will be served by providing for franchises for residential recycling and refuse collection services.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-416, § 2, adopted May 27, 2015, amended Ch. 5 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 5, §§ 5500-5511, pertained to storm water and urban runoff pollution control and derived from Ord. No. 97-272, § 1, adopted April 16, 1997; Ord. No. 00-304, §§ 1-7, adopted Sept. 13, 2000; Ord. No. 01-306, §§ 1-6, adopted Jan. 24, 2001; Ord. No. 02-314U, §§ 1-5, adopted Aug. 28, 2002; and Ord. No. 02-314, §§ 1-5, adopted Sept. 10, 2002. 

5500. - Findings. 
(a)  The Congress of the United States (hereinafter "congress") has determined that pollutants contained in storm water and urban runoff are responsible for the environmental degradation of oceans, lakes, rivers, and other Waters of the United States. 
(b)  Congress, in 1987, amended the Clean Water Act of 1972 to reduce pollutants discharged into the Waters of the United States by extending National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") requirements to regulate storm water and urban runoff discharge into municipal storm drain systems. 
(c)  Storm water and urban runoff flows from individual properties onto streets, then through storm drains to coastal waters along the City of Agoura Hills. 
(d)  The City of Agoura Hills is a co-permittee under the municipal NPDES permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region, which also serves as a NPDES permit under the Federal Clean Water Act and as a co-permittee, the city is required to implement procedures with respect to the entry of non-storm water discharges into the municipal storm water system. 
(e)  In order to control, in a cost-effective manner, the quantity and quality of storm water and urban runoff to the maximum extent practicable, the adoption of reasonable regulations, as set forth herein, is essential. 
(Ord. No. 15-416, § 2(5501), 5-27-2015) 
5501. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the future health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and the water quality of the Malibu Creek watershed and surrounding coastal areas by: 
(1)  Reducing pollutants in storm water discharges to the maximum extent practicable; 
(2)  Regulating illicit connections and illicit discharges and thereby reducing the level of contamination of storm water and urban runoff into the municipal storm water system; and 
(3)  Regulating non-storm water discharges to the municipal storm water system. 
(b)  This chapter also sets forth requirements for the construction and operation of certain commercial development, new development and redevelopment and other projects (as further defined herein) which are intended to ensure compliance with the storm water mitigation measures prescribed in the current version of the municipal NPDES Permit approved by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region, and on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(c)  This chapter authorizes the authorized enforcement officer to define and adopt applicable best management practices and other storm water pollution control measures and to cite infractions and to impose fines pursuant to this chapter. Except as otherwise provided herein, the authorized enforcement officer shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section. 
(d)  The intent of this chapter is to protect and enhance the quality of watercourses, water bodies, and wetlands within the city in a manner consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act and the NPDES permit. 
(e)  This chapter is also intended to provide the city with the legal authority necessary to control discharges to and from those portions of the municipal storm water system over which it has jurisdiction as required by the municipal NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 15-416, § 2(5502), 5-27-2015)

(Ord. No. 15-416, § 2(5507), 5-27-2015) 
5507. - Low impact development requirements for new development and redevelopment. 
(a)  Objective. The provisions of this section establish requirements for construction activities and facility operations of development and redevelopment projects to comply with the current MS4 permit (Order No. R4-2012-0175), to lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth practices, and integrate LID practices and standards for storm water pollution mitigation through means of infiltration, evapotranspiration, biofiltration, and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of new development and/or redevelopment requirements. 
(b)  Scope. This section contains requirements for storm water pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the city to further define and adopt storm water pollution control measures, and to develop LID principles and requirements, including, but not limited to, the objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section. 
(c)  Applicability. This section applies to the following new development and redevelopment projects which are subject to city conditioning and approval for the design and implementation of post-construction controls and other BMPs to mitigate storm water pollution, prior to completion of the project(s), as follows: 
(1)  New development projects. 
a.  All development projects equal to one (1) acre or greater of disturbed area that adds more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious surface area. 
b.  Industrial parks with ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of surface area. 
c.  Commercial malls with ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of surface area. 
d.  Retail gasoline outlets with five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of surface area.

f.  Parking lots with five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious surface area, or with twenty-five (25) or more parking spaces. 
g.  Street and road construction of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface area shall follow the city's green streets policy to the maximum extent practicable. Street and road construction applies to stand-alone streets, roads, highways, and freeway projects, and also applies to streets within larger projects. 
h.  Automotive service facilities (Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of 5013, 5014, 5511, 5541, 7532-7534 and 7536-7539) with five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of surface area. 
i.  Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging directly to a significant ecological area (SEA), where the development will: 
1.  Discharge storm water runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive biological species or habitat; and 
2.  Create two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet or more of impervious surface area 
j.  New single-family hillside homes. 
(2)  Redevelopment projects. 
a.  Land disturbing activity that results in the creation or addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site for categories identified in subsection (c)(1) 
b.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty (50) percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction storm water quality control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated. 
c.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty (50) percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction storm water quality control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development. 
d.  Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities that are conducted to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, original purpose of facility or emergency redevelopment activity required to protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing roads to maintain original line and grade. 
e.  Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are exempt from the redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add, or replace ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious surface area. 
(d)  LID Standards Manual. The director shall prepare, maintain, and update, as deemed necessary and appropriate, a manual ("LID Standards Manual"), which shall include urban and stormwater runoff quantity and quality control development principles and technologies for achieving compliance with the provisions of this section. The LID Standards Manual shall also include technical feasibility and implementation parameters, as well as other rules, requirements, and procedures as the director deems necessary, for implementing the provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Specific requirements. 
(1)  New single-family hillside homes. To the extent that the city may lawfully impose conditions, mitigation measures or other requirements on the construction of new single-family hillside homes, new single-family hillside homes are exempt from the new development/redevelopment project performance criteria of Part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit but shall include mitigation measures to: 
a.  Conserve natural areas; 
b.  Protect slopes and channels; 
c.  Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage; 
d.  Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in slope instability; and 
e.  Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless the diversion would result in slope instability. 
(2)  [Street and road construction.] Street and road construction of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface are exempt from the new development/redevelopment project performance criteria of Part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit but shall follow the city's green streets policy to the maximum extent practicable. 
(3)  New development and redevelopment projects. Unless otherwise exempted in this chapter or in the MS4 permit, the site for every new development and redevelopment project shall comply with Part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit and be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use in accordance with the requirements set forth in the MS4 permit and the LID Standards Manual. The project applicant shall prepare and submit a storm water mitigation plan, which shall implement set LID standards and practices for storm water pollution mitigation consistent with this chapter and the LID Standards Manual, to the director for review and approval. The storm water mitigation plan shall provide documentation to demonstrate compliance with the MS4 permit on the plans and permit application submitted to the city, and shall comply with the following: 
a.  Retain storm water runoff onsite for the storm water quality design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from: 
1.  The eighty-fifth-percentile, twenty-four-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County eighty-fifth percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or 
2.  The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75-inch, twenty-four-hour rain event, whichever is greater. 
b.  Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in the NPDES permit. 
(f)  Technical infeasibility. 
(1)  Some relief, as outlined later in this section, from the MS4 permit (Part VI.D.7.c) requirements may be granted for technical infeasibility. To demonstrate technical infeasibility, the project applicant must demonstrate that the project cannot reliably retain one hundred (100) percent of the SWQDv on site, even with the maximum application of green roofs and rainwater harvest and use, and that compliance with the applicable post-construction requirements would be technically infeasible by submitting a site-specific hydrologic and/or design analysis conducted and endorsed by a registered professional engineer, geologist, architect, and/or landscape architect. Technical infeasibility may result from conditions including the following: 
a.  The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv on site. 
b.  Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five (5) to ten (10) feet of surface grade; 
c.  Locations within one hundred (100) feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water; 
d.  Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern; 
e.  Locations with potential geotechnical hazards; 
f.  Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the on-site volume retention requirement. 
(2)  If partial or complete on-site retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained on site. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in the MS4 permit (Order No. R4-2012-0175). 
a.  Additional alternative compliance options such as off-site infiltration and groundwater replenishment projects may be available to the project site. The applicant for the project should contact the authorized enforcement officer to determine eligibility. 
(3)  The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered on site must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required by the MS4 permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of: 
a.  Two-tenths (0.2) inches per hour, or 
b.  The one-year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater. 
(g)  Exemptions from LID requirements. The provisions of this section do not apply to any of the following: 
(1)  A development involving only emergency construction activity required to immediately protect public health and safety; 
(2)  Infrastructure projects within the public right-of-way, excluding street and road construction of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface; 
(3)  A development or redevelopment involving only activity related to gas, water, cable, or electricity services on private property; 
(4)  A development or redevelopment involving only resurfacing and/or restriping of permitted parking lots, where the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, and original purpose of the facility is maintained; 
(5)  A project not requiring a city building, grading, demolition or other permit for construction activity. 
(h)  City review and approval. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new development or redevelopment project, the city shall evaluate the proposed project using the MS4 permit, and erosion and grading requirements of the city building official or authorized enforcement officer to determine (i) its potential to generate the flow of pollutants into the MS4 after construction; and (ii) how well the storm water mitigation plan for the proposed project meets the goals of this chapter. Each plan will be evaluated on its own merits according to the particular characteristics of the project and the site to be developed. Based upon the review, the city may impose conditions upon the issuance of the building permit, in addition to any required by the state construction general permit for the project, in order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the MS4. 
(i)  Issuance of discretionary permits. No discretionary permit may be issued for any new development or redevelopment project identified in this section until the authorized enforcement officer confirms that the project plans, including the storm water mitigation plan, comply with the applicable LID requirements of this chapter. Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty (50) percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-development storm water quality control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated. Where redevelopment results in an alteration to less than fifty (50) percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-development storm water quality control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development. 
(j)  Issuance of certificates of occupancy. As a condition for issuing a certificate of occupancy for a project subject to this chapter, the director shall require facility operators or owners to build all BMPs that are shown on the approved project plans and to submit an owner signed certification statement stating that the site and all LID BMPs will be maintained in compliance with the storm water mitigation plan and other applicable regulatory requirements. 
(k)  Transfer of properties subject to requirement for maintenance of BMPs. 
(1)  The transfer or lease of a property subject to a requirement for maintenance of BMPs shall include conditions requiring the transferee and its successors and assigns to either: (a) assume responsibility for maintenance of any existing BMP, or (b) to replace an existing BMP with new control measures or BMPs meeting the then-current standards of the city and the municipal NPDES permit. Such requirement shall be included in any sale or lease agreement or deed for such property. The condition of transfer shall include a provision that the successor property owner or lessee conduct maintenance inspections of all BMPs at least once a year and retain proof of inspection. 
(2)  For residential properties where the LID BMPs are located within a common area which will be maintained by a homeowner's association, language regarding the responsibility for maintenance shall be included in the project's conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&R's). Printed educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on what storm water management facilities are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how the necessary maintenance can be performed. The transfer of this information shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property. 
(3)  If LID BMPs are located within an area proposed for dedication to a public agency, they will be the responsibility of the developer until the dedication is accepted.

In the event such contact is made, the community development director shall notify such person, or persons, of the danger involved and require that such condition be immediately removed, repaired or isolated so as to preclude harm to any person or property.

If the community development director is unable to make contact as herein above noted, or if the appropriate persons, after notification by the community development director, do not take action within such time as may be specified by such official, then the community development director may take all actions deemed necessary to remove, repair or isolate such dangerous condition or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor engaged pursuant to the provisions of this Code.

(c)  Attorneys fees. A prevailing party in any action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding to abate a nuisance may recover reasonable attorney's fees in accordance with the following subdivisions: 
(1)  Attorney's fees are not recoverable by any party concerned as a prevailing party unless the city manager or city attorney elects in writing to seek recovery of the City of Agoura Hills' attorney's fees at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding. Notice of such election, when made, shall be provided to the party concerned in writing by certified and first class mail. Failure to make such an election precludes any entitlement to, or award of, attorney's fees in favor of any person or the City of Agoura Hills. 
(2)  An action or proceeding is initiated upon the City of Agoura Hills' service of any written notice to abate a public nuisance to a party concerned pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or upon the filing by the City of Agoura Hills or the People of the State of California, of any compliant, motion or pleading relating to the existence or maintenance of a public nuisance in any civil or equitable court of competent jurisdiction. Attorney's fees are not recoverable in criminal prosecution actions. 
(3)  The City of Agoura Hills is the prevailing party (i) when an administrative determination of the existence of one (1) or more conditions constituting a public nuisance is made final, or (ii) when a judge, commissioner or other judicial officer renders a judgment, decree or order finding the existence of a public nuisance and/or enjoining its continued existence. A party concerned alleged to be responsible for causing, maintaining or permitting a public nuisance is the prevailing party only (i) upon a final administrative determination finding the absence of all alleged public nuisance conditions or responsibility therefore, or, (ii) when a judge, commissioner or other judicial officer renders a judgment, decree or order in a civil or equitable action that states similar findings. 
(4)  In no event shall a party concerned be considered a prevailing party if said person is found to be responsible for at least one (1) public nuisance condition, regardless of prevailing in the same action or proceeding with regard to other alleged nuisance conditions due to their absence, or a person's lack of responsibility therefore. 
(5)  Provided that the City of Agoura Hills has made an election to seek attorney's fees, an award of attorney's fees to a person shall not exceed the amount of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the City of Agoura Hills in said action or proceeding.

The decision of the planning commission on the report and on all protests shall be final and conclusive. The planning commission may continue the hearing from time to time as it deems necessary. 
(d)  Making the special assessment. Immediately upon the determination of costs pursuant to this section 5613 by the planning commission, the planning commission shall make said costs a special assessment against the property on which the nuisance was abated. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

(a)  To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

(c)  To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the state board of equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the state board of equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes; 
(d)  To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. 
6104. - Contract with state. 
    Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the state board of equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the state board of equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter.

    For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in section 6101 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date.

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter. 
    Hotel. "Hotel" shall mean any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, rental unit, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
    Occupancy. "Occupancy" shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
    Operator. "Operator" shall mean the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
    Person. "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

"Rent" shall mean the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
    Tax administrator. "Tax administrator" shall mean the city clerk of the City of Agoura Hills or the person designated by the city clerk to act in the city clerk's place. 
    Transient. "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the thirtieth consecutive day of such occupancy or right of occupancy has elapsed, without regard to the existence or nonexistence of an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant obliging the occupant to pay market rate for the occupancy for a period of at least thirty-one (31) consecutive days. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this section may be considered. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, § 1, 6-8-2005; Ord. No. 10-372, § 1, 1-27-2010) 
6502. - Tax imposed. 
(a)  For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve (12) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator of the hotel at the same time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(b)  In the event that an agreement exists between a hotel and a transient for occupancy, as defined in this article, for a period in excess of thirty (30) days, and in the event that such transient allows occupancy by another person for thirty (30) days or fewer as subtenant, guest, licensee or permittee, the transient who has made the agreement with the hotel as aforesaid shall be subject to and shall pay the tax provided for herein.

(b)  No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim in writing made at the time rent is collected upon a form complying with subsection (e) of Section 7280 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The tax administrator may require submission of copies of such forms with the returns required by section 6506. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, § 3, 6-8-2005) 
6504. - Responsibility of operator. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84) 
6505. - Registration of hotel. 
    Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax administrator and obtain a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(a)  The name of the operator. 
(b)  The address of the hotel. 
(c)  The date upon which the certificate was issued. 
(d)  The following statement: 
    This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the City of Agoura Hills by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84) 
6506. - Reporting and remitting. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter or of such different reporting period as may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by the tax administrator, of the total rents charged and received, the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies, and such other information as may be reasonably required. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish either shorter or longer reporting periods for any individual certificate holder or category of certificate holders if the tax administrator deems it necessary or desirable in order to insure collection of the tax or to increase the efficiency of its administration. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.

6507. - Reporting and remitting requirements upon transfer or cessation of business. 
(a)  An operator who is transferring, selling, or terminating its business shall notify the tax administrator in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date of transfer, sale, or termination. If the decision to sell, transfer, or terminate the business is made fewer than thirty (30) days before the transfer, sale, or termination occurs, the operator shall notify the tax administrator immediately upon making that decision and in no event later than the date of transfer, sale, or termination. The operator shall at the same time notify in writing any purchaser or transferee of its hotel of the purchaser's or transferee's potential responsibility for unpaid collected taxes if any, as set forth in this article and in Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5. 
(b)  Upon cessation of business, whether by sale, transfer, termination, an operator shall, on or before the same day of the next month following the cessation of business, or on the last day of that month if no corresponding day exists, make a return to the tax administrator on approved forms of the total taxable rents charged, the amount of tax collected for the reporting period ending on the cessation date, remittances made if any, and the balance of the tax due. The balance of tax due if any shall be remitted to the tax administrator at the time the final return is filed. After filing the final return and remitting the balance due, the operator shall make its records of account available for a closeout audit by the tax administrator or his or her designee. Returns filed and taxes remitted and actually received by the tax administrator on or before the same day of the next month following cessation of business, or on the last day of that month of no corresponding day exists, shall be timely filed and remitted; otherwise, the taxes are delinquent and subject to the penalties imposed by this article. 
(c)  Any person purchasing an ongoing hotel business may apply to the tax administrator for a tax clearance certificate showing the tax due, if any, from the selling operator as of a date specified in the tax clearance certificate request. For purposes of this section, successive hotel businesses conducted without substantial interruption at the same hotel shall constitute an ongoing hotel business. 
(1)  The issuance and effect of such certificates shall be as set forth in Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5. 
(2)  Before requesting records and conducting the audit permitted by subdivision (b) of Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. The tax administrator shall notify the selling operator of this estimate when requesting records for audit. If the selling operator fails to provide records in response to the request within thirty (30) days after the serving or mailing of the estimate and record request, the tax administrator may issue a tax certificate in the amount of the estimate. 
(3)  By resolution, the city may set an administrative fee for issuance of any such certificate. 
(Ord. No. 05-332, § 4, 6-8-2005) 
6508. - Penalties and interest. 
(a)  Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
(b)  Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed. 
(c)  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
(d)  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one (1) percent per month for each month or portion of a month that the tax shall be delinquent on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the tax first became delinquent until paid. The interest shall be computed on a monthly basis and shall not be subject to proration for any portion of a month. 
(e)  Penalties merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, § 5, 6-8-2005) 
6509. - Failure to collect and report tax determination of tax by tax administrator. 
    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as the tax administrator may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as the tax administrator is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter. In the event such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in section 6510. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, § 5, 6-8-2005) 
6510. - Appeal. 
    Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, § 5, 6-8-2005) 
6511. - Records. 
(a)  It is the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of four (4) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax for which the operator may be or may have been liable. The tax administrator shall have the right to inspect all such records at all reasonable times. 
(b)  All tax returns and information furnished by any operator pursuant to this chapter shall be confidential and shall not be open to public inspection nor the specific contents thereof disclosed by any officer or employee except as necessary in the performance of official duty pursuant to this chapter, or in the course of any proceeding, hearing or litigation involving the existence or amount of the tax liability of such operator, or with the written consent of the operator or his authorized representative. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, §§ 5, 6, 6-8-2005) 
6512. - Refunds. 
(a)  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be refunded as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. No refund shall be issued except upon a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, filed with the tax administrator within one (1) year of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. Each person seeking a refund must file an individual claim; no class claims shall be recognized. 
(b)  Claim by operator. An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(c)  Claim by transient. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subparagraph (a), but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(d)  Evidence. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, §§ 5, 7, 6-8-2005) 
6513. - Tax declared a debt; action to collect. 
(a)  Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this article shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this article shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovering of such amount. 
(b)  Failure of an operator to collect tax required to be paid by any transient shall not excuse the operator's obligation under this article. An operator must pay to the city any tax required to be paid by any transient, whether or not the operator collects such tax from that transient. 
(c)  If any amount required to be paid to the city under this article is not paid when due, the tax administrator may, within ten (10) years after the amount is confirmed according to the procedure set forth in section 6507 of this article, file for record in the office of the Los Angeles County recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties, and interest due; the name and address, as it appears on the tax administrator's records, of the operator liable for the tax, penalties, and interest; and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of filing for record, the amount of the tax, penalties, and interest constitutes a lien upon any real property in the county owned by the operator or acquired by the operator thereafter. This lien has the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten (10) years from the time of filing of the certificate, unless sooner released or otherwise discharged, or unless renewed for subsequent periods in the manner prescribed by law. This article does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien that was attached before the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien. 
(d)  The amounts required to be paid by any operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases: 
(1)  Whenever the operator is insolvent; 
(2)  Whenever the operator makes a voluntary assignment of its assets; 
(3)  Whenever the estate of the operator in the hands of executors, administrators, heirs, or receivers is insufficient to pay all debts; 
(4)  Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent operator required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by process of law. 
(Ord. No. 66, 9-19-84; Ord. No. 05-332, §§ 5, 8, 6-8-2005) 
6514. - Penalty for violations. 
    Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as provided in section 1200 of this Code. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

(a)  Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any rights or privileges therein granted, without prior consent of the council, and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the council, which consent will not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without consent of the council shall be null and void. No such consent shall be required for a transfer (1) to any affiliate of grantee which is entirely owned or controlled by grantee or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with grantee, in each case as of the effective date of grantee's franchise, or (2) in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except when such hypothecation exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the property of franchisee being so hypothecated. 
(b)  The requirements of subsection (a) shall apply to any change in control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a corporation, prior council approval shall be required where ownership or control of more than ten (10) percent of the voting stock of grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, consent of council shall not be required with respect to transfers of voting stock of grantee between or among shareholders of grantee holding issued and outstanding voting stock of grantee as of the effective date of grantee's franchise. 
(c)  Grantee shall notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of grantee or upon termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be considered by the city as notice that a change in control or ownership of the franchise has taken place, and the provisions under this section governing consent of the city to such change in control or ownership shall apply. 
(d)  For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall assist grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking grantor's consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of ensuring that transferee completes an application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the city, which application shall include the information required under subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (m), (n), and (o) of section 6910 of this chapter. An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date of transfer, and the proposed transferee's qualifications shall be reviewed on the same basis as if transferee were an initial applicant. Grantee or its proposed transferee shall reimburse the city all its costs associated with processing and evaluating the proposed transfer. Transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. 
(e)  Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchisee or its assets for advancement of money for construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to grantor shall take control of and operate the cable communications system in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within thirty (30) days of assuming such control that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one (1) year unless extended by grantor in its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition grantor to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If, after considering legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualities of the applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, grantor shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. Consent of grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. 
(Ord. No. 198, § 1, 10-9-91) 
6907. - Geographical coverage. 
    Grantee shall design, construct, and maintain the cable television system to pass every single-family dwelling unit and multiple-family dwelling unit in its service area in accordance with the requirements set forth in grantee's franchise. Hospitals, rest homes, boarding houses, schools, commercial facilities, and institutional and governmental buildings within the area of the franchise shall be provided cable service in accordance with requirements therefor set forth in grantee's franchise. 
    After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any area, grantee shall provide service to any requesting subscriber within that area within thirty (30) days from the date of request; provided that grantee is able to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty-day period on reasonable terms and conditions. 
(Ord. No. 198, § 1, 10-9-91) 
6908. - Nonexclusive franchise. 
    Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable communications system or any component thereof as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that such additional grants shall not operate to modify, revoke, or terminate any rights then held by any grantee.

The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the state video franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. 
(g)  Emergency alert system and emergency overrides. A state video franchise holder must comply with the emergency alert system requirements of the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the holder's network.

(2)  The city shall either approve or deny an application from a holder of a state video franchise for an encroachment permit within sixty (60) days of receiving a completed application. 
(3)  If the city denies an application for an encroachment permit, the city shall, at the time of notifying the applicant of the denial, furnish to the applicant written notice of the reason for the denial. An applicant may appeal the city's denial of an encroachment permit application to the city council in accordance with the following procedures: 
(i)  No notice of appeal will be processed unless filed within ten (10) days after service of written notice of the decision from which the appeal is taken; provided that if written notice of the decision has not been served, the appellant may, within ten (10) days after being apprised of that decision, demand service of written notice and will have ten (10) days following that service in which to file the notice of appeal. 
(ii)  The notice of appeal must specify the specific decision from which the appeal is taken, the specific grounds for the appeal, and the relief or action requested from the city council. 
(iii)  The notice of appeal must be accompanied by such fee as may have been established by resolution of the city council. 
(iv)  Upon the timely filing of a notice of appeal in proper form, the city clerk will schedule the matter for hearing by the city council at a regular meeting, but not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the notice of appeal. The city clerk will cause the notice of hearing to be given to the appellant not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing, unless that notice is waived in writing by the appellant. The city clerk will also cause a copy of the notice of appeal and the hearing to be transmitted to the city official or body whose decision is being appealed. 
(v)  At the time of consideration of the appeal by the city council, the appellant will be limited to a presentation on the specific grounds of appeal and related matters set forth in its notice of appeal. The appellant will have the burden of persuading the city council that the decision appealed from should be reversed or modified. 
(vi)  The city council may continue the hearing on the appeal from time to time as may be deemed necessary. The city council may, by resolution, affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the decision appealed from and may take any action that might have been taken in the first instance by the city official or body from whose decision the appeal has been taken. 
(vii)  The decision of the city council will be deemed final and conclusive upon adoption of the resolution. A copy of the resolution adopted by the city council will be served upon the appellant by placement in the United States mail, postage prepaid, to the appellant's last known address.

By acceptance of a franchise hereunder, grantee hereby agrees to pay any assessment to be levied against the security fund hereinabove provided and collected by grantor immediately upon such assessment. Such assessment shall not constitute a waiver by grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or under applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including actual attorneys' fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise;

(b)  If grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the insurance coverage or security fund as required herein;

(g)  If grantee's application or application contents are later found to contain any material misstatement or omission which is determined to be materially misleading and knowingly made by grantee.

Said notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision.

(d)  In the event council finds that alleged violations exist and that grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor or is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, grantor may impose one (1) or more of the remedies specified herein as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances.

To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
(c)  Grantor shall have the right to order grantee to increase the security fund at such times and in such amounts as are set forth in grantee's franchise agreement.

8400. - Adoption of safety assessment placards-Purpose and scope. 
    This chapter establishes standard safety assessment placards to be used to indicate the condition of a building or structure for continued occupancy after any natural or manmade disaster, hazard, fire or other situation that could affect the safe occupancy of a building or structure in the City. The building official and his or her designated deputies are hereby authorized to post the appropriate safety assessment placard at each entry point to a building or structure upon the completion of a safety assessment. 
    The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all buildings and structures of all occupancies in the City of Agoura Hills. 
(Ord. No. 07-350, § 1, 12-12-2007) 
8401. - Safety assessment. 
    For purposes of this chapter, a safety assessment is a visual, non-destructive examination of a building or structure for the purpose of determining the condition of the building or structure for continued occupancy following any natural or manmade disaster, hazard, fire or other occurrence that could affect the safe occupancy of a building or structure in the city. Such assessment shall be made by the building official or the authorized deputies and representatives of the building official. The assessment may be made at the discretion of the building official or upon request by an owner or occupant of the property in question. 
(Ord. No. 07-350, § 1, 12-12-2007) 
8402. - Placards. 
(a)  The following are physical descriptions and text of the official safety assessment placards to be used to designate the condition for continued occupancy of buildings or structures as provided in this chapter. Copies of actual safety assessment placards are attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and shall be kept on file in the city clerk's office. The city council hereby delegates to the building official the authority to, from time to time, make such minor adjustments to the text on the placards as the building official deems necessary. 
(1)  Inspected. Lawful Occupancy Permitted (Green Placard) is to be posted on any building or structure wherein no apparent structural hazard has been found. This placard is not intended to imply that a building or structure is undamaged, merely that there is no apparent structural hazard. 
(2)  Restricted use (Yellow Placard) is to be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged wherein the damage has resulted in some form of restriction to the continued occupancy. The individual who posts this placard shall note in general terms the type of damage encountered and shall clearly and concisely note the restrictions on continued occupancy. 
(3)  Unsafe. Do Not Enter or Occupy (Red Placard) is to be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged such that continued occupancy poses a threat to life or safety. Buildings or structures posted with this placard shall not be entered under any circumstance except as authorized in writing by the building official, or his or her authorized representative. safety assessment teams shall be authorized to enter these buildings at any time. This placard is not to be used or considered as a demolition order. The individual who posts this placard shall note in general terms the type of damage encountered. 
(b)  This ordinance number, the name of the City, its address, and telephone number shall be permanently affixed to each placard, along with the printed name and signature of the building official or deputy who made the safety assessment and posted the placard. 
(c)  Once a safety assessment placard has been attached to a building or structure, it shall be unlawful for any person other than the building official or his/her authorized representative designee to remove, alter, tamper with, cover, obscure or conceal a placard until done so by an authorized representative of the building official, unless the building official has given his/her written authorization to do so to the property owner or other legal occupant of the property in question. A violation of this section may be prosecuted as an infraction or a misdemeanor, in the discretion of the city prosecutor.

Chapter 5 - TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEES[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 11-389, § 2, adopted Sept. 27, 2011, repealed Ch. 5 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 5 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 5, §§ 8500-8514, pertained to arterial street system development fee and derived from Ord. No. 153, § 1, adopted Sept. 28, 1988; Ord. No. 192, § 1, adopted June 5, 1991; Ord. No. 98-285, § 1, adopted April 8, 1998; Ord. No. 99-289, §§ 1, 2, adopted Jan. 13, 1999. 
Cross reference- Streets, Art. VII; zoning, Art. IX. 

8500. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  New residential and nonresidential development in the City of Agoura Hills (the "city") has attracted and will continue to attract employees and residents to the city, and there is a causal connection between such development projects and the increased need for transportation facilities. 
(b)  Failure to enhance the ability of the city's transportation system to accommodate increased traffic by improving traffic flow will make it more difficult for residents, employers, and employees to access residences and places of employment and could cause unacceptable harm to the quality of life in the city. 
(c)  Sources of city revenue other than transportation impact fees, including tax revenues which will be paid by new residential and nonresidential development, will be needed for many public purposes and therefore will not be sufficient to offset the burdens on transportation facilities created by new development. 
(d)  It is the intent of the city to require every person or organization that develops land to mitigate the impacts of that development on the city's transportation system. The city may therefore require developers to mitigate transportation impacts caused by their development and to pay a transportation impact fee that will be used to mitigate those impacts by constructing transportation facilities pursuant to the most current 2011 capital improvements plan. 
(e)  The amount of transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be limited to the cost of transportation impact mitigation attributable to new development. The amount of transportation impact fees collected shall not include the cost of transportation impact mitigation measures made necessary by existing development. 
(Ord. No. 11-389, § 2, 9-27-2011) 
8501. - Residential transportation impact fees required. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 8503, the required transportation impact fee for a residential building shall be paid in an amount established by resolution of the city council. The required transportation impact fee shall be due and paid on a lump-sum basis on the date the first dwelling in the development or development phase receives its final building inspection, or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  The city engineer, or his or her designee, shall be responsible for calculating the amount of the transportation impact fee required for each development project based on the applicable land use category and corresponding rate specified in the resolution which adopts the transportation impact fee. In calculating such fee, the city engineer shall utilize the fee rate that is assigned to the land use category that is most applicable to the development project. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, "final building inspection" shall mean the physical inspection of the building by the Building and Safety Division of the Community Development Department of the City of Agoura Hills for compliance with all applicable building codes and the issuance by all applicable city, county, regional, state and federal agencies of their respective clearances for occupancy. 
(d)  For the purposes of this section, "certificate of occupancy" shall mean a document issued by the proper authority allowing the occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure, building or development conforms with all applicable provisions of the Agoura Hills Municipal Code, ordinances and conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 11-389, § 2, 9-27-2011) 
8502. - Nonresidential transportation impact fees required. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 8503, the required transportation impact fee for a nonresidential development shall be paid in an amount established by resolution of the city council. The required transportation impact fee shall be due and paid on a lump-sum basis on the date of the final building inspection of the building, or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  The city engineer, or his or her designee, shall be responsible for calculating the amount of the transportation impact fee required for each development project based on the applicable land use category and corresponding rate specified in the resolution which adopts the transportation impact fee. In calculating such fee, the city engineer shall utilize the fee rate that is assigned to the land use category that is most applicable to the development project. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, "certificate of occupancy" shall mean a document issued by the proper authority allowing the occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure, building or development conforms to all the applicable building codes, the Agoura Hills Municipal Code, and conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 11-389, § 2, 9-27-2011) 
8503. - Transportation impact fees-Exemption, reduction, or installment payment options. 
(a)  The following uses and types of developments may be exempted from the payment of transportation impact fees: 
(1)  Any residential development that does not increase the number of permanent housing units on the parcel where the construction takes place, such as remodeling or rebuilding existing units. 
(2)  The remodeling or rebuilding of an existing nonresidential structure, provided the remodeling or rebuilding does not do any of the following: (i) increase the square footage of the structure above that of the previously existing structure; (ii) increase the building footprint above that of the previously existing structure; (iii) change the use to which the property or structure is to be put; or (iv) increase the average daily trips generated from the property above the amount generated by the prior use of the property. 
(3)  City-owned facilities, including, but not limited to, public libraries, and public parks. 
(4)  Facilities serving the health and safety of the public, including, but not limited to, police, fire and safety facilities. 
(b)  A developer may be exempted or allowed a reduction in fees from the transportation impact fee requirements of sections 8501 and 8502 if the developer enters into a development agreement with the city pursuant to which transportation impact fees are assessed to the developer, or equivalent or comparable transportation improvements are implemented by the developer. 
(c)  A developer may be entitled to a reduction in the amount of the transportation impact fee required by sections 8501 and 8502 if the developer constructs transportation improvements pursuant to the most current 2011 capital improvements plan. The transportation impact fee may be reduced by the amount of transportation improvement costs that would be reasonably incurred by the city in building those same transportation improvements. The amount of such reduction shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer prior to construction of the transportation improvement. 
(d)  A developer may be entitled to a reduction in the amount of the transportation impact fee required by sections 8501 and 8502 if the development is located in an assessment district that has been formed to construct facilities pursuant to the most current 2011 capital improvements plan. The transportation impact fee may be reduced by the amount of the total assessment placed upon the development for the costs of transportation improvements. The amount of such reduction shall not exceed the amount of the transportation impact fee required by sections 8501 and 8502. 
(e)  If a fee exemption or a fee reduction is granted pursuant to this section 8503, any subsequent change or intensification of the use or uses of the property or any expansion of the structures on the property, shall invalidate the fee exemption or fee reduction, and the applicant shall be subject to the transportation impact fee requirement applicable to the entire development based on the fee in effect at the time of the change or expansion, less any amount previously paid. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, commercial or industrial development projects required to contribute two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) or more in fees under this chapter are eligible to utilize an alternative payment method and pay the fees required by this chapter in the following amount and manner: 
(1)  In order to be entitled to utilize the alternative payment method provided by this section, the developer or property owner shall enter into a written agreement with the city, in the form required by the city, setting forth the amount of the fees required to be paid and the method of payment. This agreement shall include a promissory note and deed of trust recorded against the subject property, securing the developer's or property owner's obligations under this chapter. In the event of a default by the developer or property owner of its obligations under this section, and the agreement, the city shall have recourse against the deed of trust and shall have the right to exercise any other remedies to which it is entitled under law. 
(2)  The fees required by the transportation impact fee resolution shall be paid within ten (10) days of the executed alternative payment method agreement, and prior to the issuance of a building permit for the commercial or industrial development project, in up to three (3) installments, with the first installment paid prior to the issuance of a building permit and the remaining two (2) installments, subject to the average annual local agency investment fund monthly apportionment rate for the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the agreement, paid annually thereafter. 
(3)  The written alternative payment method agreement required by this section shall be approved by the city council for any commercial or industrial development project that is required to contribute two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) or more in fees under this chapter.

ARTICLE IX - ZONING[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Article IX, Zoning, derives from Ord. No. 120, adopted February 3, 1987. Sections which do not bear a history note may be assumed to be derived unchanged from that ordinance. Subsequent amendments have been included and are noted at the end of the sections which they affect. Consult the Code Comparative Table to determine which subsection or subsections were amended. 
With the city's permission, in order to make the section numbers in this article more nearly like those in the other articles, the editor has renumbered the sections. For the most part, the renumbering consists of compressing a seven-digit number into a four or five-digit number. A Zoning Ordinance Conversion Table lists old and new section numbers. The editor also added part and division titles. 
Ord. No. 185, adopted Apr. 24, 1991, provided for the adoption by reference of Art. IX, Zoning, of this Code, as amended by ordinances adopted subsequent to Ord. No. 170.

E.  The occupancy of the inclusionary units shall be governed by the terms of the inclusionary housing agreement recorded as a deed restriction against the property.

    The purpose of the following special use standards is to provide specific criteria for the development of the indicated uses. 
9281.1. - Application. 
    The provisions of these sections shall apply to the conversion of existing dwelling units to condominiums. The term condominium shall include row houses, townhouses, and stock cooperatives. 
9281.2. - Application content. 
    Recognizing that the conversion of existing structures which have been previously occupied and constructed as rental units presents unique problems to present tenants and future buyers, the application for a conditional use permit for a condominium conversion project shall include the following information in addition to that required by other sections of this Code: 
A.  The proposed organizational documents, including the covenants, conditions and restrictions to be recorded pursuant to Section 1350 et seq. of the Civil Code. The organizational documents shall provide for the following: 
1.  Transfer of title to each unit; 
2.  Assignment of parking for each owner, and provisions for parking of recreational vehicles; 
3.  The management of common areas within the project, and the complex generally; 
4.  The antidiscrimination provisions set forth in section 9281.7C; 
5.  A maintenance program and proposed budget. 
B.  A property report. A property report shall be prepared by an engineer, which shall describe the condition and estimate the remaining useful life of each of the following elements of each structure situated within the project proposed for conversion: roofs, foundations, exterior paint, insulation, paved surfaces, mechanical systems, electrical systems, plumbing systems, sewage systems, sprinkler systems for landscaping, utility delivery systems, central or community heating and air conditioning systems, fire protection systems including any automatic sprinkler systems, alarm systems, standpipe systems, structural elements, and drainage systems. 
The property report shall state what the sound transmission class and sound impact class of the existing floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall assemblies of sample units are. The report shall also explain, in nontechnical terms, what the class ratings mean and state what measures, if any, the applicant should and will take to improve sound attenuation between units. Projects constructed after July 1, 1979, that were in total compliance with the Building Code at the time of construction shall be exempt from the property report requirement. 
The property report shall list each built-in appliance to be contained in each or any unit offered for sale and shall state whether the appliance is or will be new or used when the unit is first offered for sale. The report shall also state the terms and nature of the warranty offered by the applicant on each such appliance. 
Each portion of the property report shall be prepared by an appropriately licensed engineer. 
C.  A structural pest control report. 
D.  A building history report identifying the date of construction of all elements of the project. 
E.  A report identifying all characteristics of the building not in compliance with this article or applicable building or housing codes. 
F.  A rental history report detailing the size, in square footage, of the building or buildings and each unit; the current or last rental rate; the name and address of each present tenant; the monthly rental rate for the preceding three (3) years for each unit; the average monthly vacancy over the preceding three (3) years. In addition, evidence in writing certified under penalty of perjury shall be submitted that shows that tenants have been notified and have acknowledged the applicants' intent to file a request for conversion for a period of at least ninety (90) days prior to the initial filing of an application for a conversion conditional use permit and/or tentative subdivision map, and have received all other notices. 
Failure to provide any information required by (B) through (F), above, shall be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration given under penalty of perjury, setting forth in detail all efforts undertaken to discover the information and all reasons why the information could not be obtained. 
G.  A detailed report describing the relocation and moving assistance information to be given to each tenant, and the steps the applicant will take to ensure the successful relocation of each tenant. The report should state in detail what assistance will be provided for special category tenants, including a discussion of long-term or life-term leases and provisions to allow such tenants to continue renting after conversion until comparable housing is located and their move can be completed. 
H.  A survey of all the tenants in the conversion project indicating how long each tenant had been a resident of the project, how long each tenant had planned to live in the project, whether or not each tenant would be interested in purchasing a unit, to which area would each tenant choose to relocate if the conversion took place and the tenant did not purchase a unit, and the extent of tenant approval in principle of the conversion. This survey shall include the applicant's best estimate of the sales price for each unit, not including inflation and adjustments that would take place during conversion. 
To comply with this provision, the applicant shall provide a tenant rights handout and a questionnaire, in a form approved by the city, to each tenant with an envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the planning and community development department. The questionnaire shall direct the tenant to return the completed form directly to such department.

J.  The conversion project shall be subject to the inclusionary housing requirements stipulated in section 9133 et seq., and shall be required to submit, as part of the application, any materials identified in the aforementioned section. 
(Ord. No. 11-383, § 16, 3-9-2011) 
9281.3. - Ownership association. 
    The applicant shall submit to the planning department a copy of the proposed maintenance program and budget by a homeowners' association or other such enforceable means that will ensure maintenance of common areas, landscaping, private streets, parking areas, and recreational facilities, and a proposed budget detailing sources and application of fund. 
9281.4. - Building code requirements. 
    A building proposed for conversion, and each unit within the building, shall comply at a minimum with all applicable building code standards in effect at the time of the last alteration, repair, relocation, or reconstruction of the building, requiring compliance with the Building Code, or, if none, at the time of first construction.

9281.5. - Exceptions. 
    No building shall be permitted to be converted to condominium ownership unless the building was constructed and subject to a building permit issued under the provisions of the 1952 Uniform Building Code, or a subsequently adopted Uniform Building Code, unless it is found by the city that the building constructed prior to 1952 is decent, safe and sanitary. 
A.  No building constructed after May 10, 1980, shall be permitted to be converted to condominium ownership unless the building was constructed in full compliance with all applicable building codes and the development standards applicable to new condominium construction, in effect at the time of the last alteration, repair, relocation, or reconstruction of the building, or, if none, at the time of first construction. 
9281.6. - Building inspection. 
    After reviewing the property report required pursuant to section 9281.2(B) to (E) and after inspecting the structures within the project when deemed necessary, the building official shall identify and make available to the planning commission all items evidenced by such reports or inspection to be in noncompliance with applicable building and housing codes or to be hazardous to the life, health or safety of any occupant of the units within the project or the general public. In addition, a report shall be prepared depicting conformance with the present Uniform Building Codes. All such items shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the building official. An appropriate fee to cover the cost of the review and inspection by the department of building and safety may be collected. 
A.  Performance bond. If the proposed project does not comply with the conversion requirements relating to utilities, personal safety or Building Code compliance, or if the building official identifies items to be corrected as provided in this section, any conditional use permit approving such conversion shall require the developer to furnish a performance bond or other means of security, approved by the city attorney, in an amount to be determined by the building official to be the reasonable estimated cost to bring the project into compliance with said codes and to make all necessary repairs. The bond shall run in favor of individual purchasers and the homeowners' association, both of whom should be named on said bond, and the bond shall provide for reasonable attorney's fees in the event of default by the principal. 
9281.7. - Consumer protection provisions. 
    In addition to the tenant protection provisions set forth in the Subdivision Map Act, the applicant shall comply with the following provisions, as conditions of any conditional use permit for a condominium conversion project approved pursuant to these sections: 
A.  Sales and lease termination. The tenants of the project on the date of application shall be offered the first right of refusal to purchase units. The offer shall run for sixty (60) days. A tenant of any project proposed for conversion on the date of application for each conversion may terminate any lease after giving thirty (30) days' notice. 
B.  Relocation assistance. The applicant shall offer to each eligible tenant a plan for relocation to comparable housing, as approved by the city. 
The relocation plan shall provide, at a minimum, for the following: 
1.  Assistance to each eligible tenant in locating comparable housing, including but not limited to, providing availability reports and transportation, where necessary. 
2.  Payment of a relocation fee to each tenant who does not choose to stay. The payment shall be a cash payment of at least one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00). A tenant is not entitled to a relocation fee pursuant to this subsection if the tenant has been evicted for just cause. Cash payment minimums will be adjusted annually, in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area. In addition, a cash payment of actual deposit costs not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be made for utility deposits and hook-up costs. 
3.  In the case of eligible tenants who are senior citizen, handicapped, low income, or single heads of households living with one (1) or more minor children, the following additional provisions must be made: 
a.  Payment, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), of the first two (2) months' rent in the new complex, if required upon moving in; and the transfer to the new complex of all key, utility, and pet deposits to which the tenant is entitled upon vacating the unit. Cleaning and security deposits, minus damages, shall be refunded to the tenant upon vacating the unit. 
b.  In lieu of the transfer of deposits to the new complex, the tenant may, at his or her option, elect to be refunded all deposits to which he or she is entitled. 
c.  If the amount of deposits and other fees required upon moving into the new complex exceed the amounts refunded to the tenant and transferred to the new complex, plus damages deducted therefrom, the applicant shall pay the difference. 
d.  If the amount of damage to any unit exceeds the deposit, the excess may be subtracted from the relocation assistance payment. 
e.  Life-term and long-term leases. The applicant shall offer eligible tenants leases for a term of: 
i.  Fifty-nine (59) years when the tenant is elderly or handicapped and also qualifies as being low income. Such leases shall provide that annual rent increases shall not exceed the percentage change in HUD's defined fair market rent. 
ii.  Fifty-nine (59) years when the tenant is elderly or handicapped with a moderate income or greater. Rents may be increased at the prevailing market rate. 
iii.  An annually renewable lease for a term not to exceed five (5) years for low income households when the planning commission finds that comparable units are not available for the relocation of low income persons. Such agreements shall be certified for tenant eligibility each calendar year. Qualification for the federal Section 8 program or its successor shall constitute certification. 
4.  The offer to each eligible tenant of a plan for relocation shall be free of any coercion, intimidation, inducement or promise not herein specified and shall not cause the tenant to vacate in advance of, a timetable or schedule for relocation as approved in its application for approval of conversion. 
C.  Antidiscrimination. The applicant or owner of any condominium unit within a project shall not discriminate in the sale, or in the terms and conditions of sale, of any dwelling unit against any person who is or was a lessee or tenant of any such dwelling unit because such person opposed, in any manner, the conversion of such building into a condominium. In a like manner, the applicant or owner shall not discriminate in the sale, or in the terms and conditions of sale of any dwelling unit against any person or family based upon age or family size, when family size does not exceed HUD's standard for overcrowding of one and one-fourth (1.25) persons per room. This antidiscrimination section shall be included in the conditions, covenants and restrictions for the project. 
D.  Preconversion protection. From the date of application for a conditions use permit to convert, or until relocation takes place or the application is denied or withdrawn, but in no event for more than two (2) years, no tenant shall be unjustly evicted and no tenant's rent shall be increased (1) more frequently than once every six (6) months, nor (2) in an amount greater than the annual increase in utility costs and insurance costs, plus increased operating costs not to exceed two (2) percent per year. This limitation shall not apply if rent increases are expressly provided for in leases or contracts in existence prior to the filing date of the conditional use permit for the conversion. 
E.  Appliance warranties. The applicant shall provide free of charge to the first individual purchaser of each unit a one-year warranty on each built-in appliance contained in the unit, whether new or used. 
9281.8. - Development standards. 
    The following development standards shall apply to all applications for a conditional use permit for condominium conversion: 
A.  Utilities: 
1.  Gas. Each condominium unit shall have a separate gas service where gas is a necessary utility. If this provision places unreasonable economic burden on the applicant, the planning commission may approve an alternative. 
2.  Electricity. Each condominium unit shall have a separate electrical service, with separate meters and disconnects, and ground fault interrupters where ground fault interrupters are required by present building codes. 
3.  Telephone company access. The telephone company serving the location proposed for conversion shall have the right to construct and maintain (place, operate, inspect, repair, replace and remove) communication facilities as it may from time-to-time require (including access) in or upon any portion of the common area, including the interior and exterior of the buildings as necessary to maintain communication service within the project. This provision may not be amended or terminated without the consent of the serving telephone company. 
B.  Parking. The required parking for condominiums shall be provided for all conversion projects. 
9281.9. - Findings required for approval. 
    The commission shall not approve a conditional use permit for a conversion unless it finds: 
A.  That the proposed conversion is consistent with the general plan, particularly with the objectives, policies, and programs of the housing element of the general plan designed to provide affordable housing to all economic segments of the population. 
B.  That the average rental vacancy rate in multiple-family units of similar size in a ten-mile radius during the twelve (12) months preceding the filing of the application is greater than five (5) percent; provided, that a conditional use permit may be approved where the vacancy rate is equal to or less than five (5) percent if the applicant has proposed measures which the commission finds would effectively mitigate the displacement of tenants and any adverse effects upon the housing stock in a ten-mile radius which would be caused by the proposed conversion. 
In evaluating the average rental vacancy rate in the affected areas and in the building proposed for conversion, the commission shall consider the rental history of the building, including the number of evictions and increases in rent over the preceding three (3) years. In addition, the following sources of vacancy rates statistics may be used: (1) department of finance (State of California), (2) postal service, and (3) HUD vacancy rates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission may deny a conditional use permit if it finds that vacancies in the building have been created by unjust evictions and unreasonable rent increased in order to qualify a project for conversion under this subsection. 
C.  That the applicant unconditionally offered to each eligible tenant an adequate plan for relocation to comparable housing. In determining whether the housing to which the applicant proposes relocation is "comparable," the commission must find that the housing is decent, safe, and sanitary, and in compliance with all local and state housing codes; and, that the housing is open to all persons regardless of race, creed, age, national origin, ancestry, religion, marital status, or gender. In addition, the commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether the relocation housing is comparable: 
1.  Whether the housing is provided with facilities equivalent to that provided by the landlord in the dwelling unit in which the tenant then resides in regard to each of the following: 
a.  Apartment size including number of rooms; 
b.  Rent range; 
c.  Major kitchen and bathroom facilities; 
d.  Special facilities for the handicapped, infirmed or senior citizens; 
e.  Willingness to accept families with children. 
2.  Whether the housing is located in an area that is comparable with the area in which the tenant then resides in regard to: 
a.  Accessibility to the tenant's place of employment; 
b.  Accessibility to community and commercial facilities; 
c.  Accessibility to schools; and 
d.  Accessibility to public transportation. 
A unit is not comparable if it is located in a building for which a notice of intent to convert has been given, except where the rental units of the building will not be offered for sale as condominium units within two (2) years. 
9282. - Institutional uses; purposes. 
    The purpose of these sections is to establish the appropriate criteria for institutional-oriented uses that require a conditional use permit in the various residential land use districts. Such uses include churches, large day care centers, homes for aged persons, homes for children, convents and monasteries, private schools, and similar uses. 
9282.1. - Location criteria. 
    The following locations are considered appropriate for institutional uses: 
A.  On major, fully improved public through streets, particularly on corners; 
B.  On larger lots so that the impacts can be mitigated; 
C.  On lots with good access and adequate areas for parking and open space. 
9283. - Accessory dwelling units; purpose. 
    The purpose of the following standards for accessory dwelling units is to provide for the development of additional housing units within existing residential neighborhoods. In addition, these standards establish criteria that guarantee that accessory dwelling units will be compatible with the neighborhood in which they will be located and the community as a whole, and protect the general health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 434, § 14, 1-10-2018) 
9283.1. - Accessory dwelling unit standards. 
    A ministerial permit shall be issued for accessory dwelling units that conform to the following standards:

2.  No passageway shall be required in conjunction with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. 
3.  Building lot coverage standards of the underlying land use district shall not apply to prevent the construction of an accessory dwelling unit. Nonetheless, the lot coverage of an accessory dwelling unit shall be added to the lot coverage of the primary residence in determining whether the lot coverage requirement for the property as a whole would allow for a future addition to the single-family dwelling, or the construction of an accessory building or structure excluding an accessory dwelling unit. 
J.  Attached accessory dwelling unit standards: 
1.  The maximum floor area of an attached accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the living area of the proposed or existing single-family dwelling, nor exceed nine hundred fifty (950) square feet, whichever is less.

v.  Located in an area where the City requires on-street parking permits but does not offer the permits to the occupants of the accessory dwelling unit. 
3.  If required parking for the existing single-family dwelling is removed in conjunction with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit, the removed parking spaces must be replaced with an equal number of on-site parking spaces. The replacement parking spaces may be located in any configuration on the same lot as the accessory dwelling unit, including, but not limited to, required yard areas, covered, uncovered, tandem within a garage or within on-site driveway areas, or provided by the use of a mechanical automotive parking lift. Covered replacement parking spaces shall not: (i) be erected in the required minimum front yard of the district; (ii) be within ten (10) feet of any main building or rear lot line; (iii) be within five (5) feet of any side lot line; (iv) exceed fourteen (14) feet in height; nor (v) exceed the lot coverage requirements of the underlying land use district. 
N.  For the purposes of this section, "living area" means the interior habitable area of a dwelling unit, including basements and attics but not including a garage or an accessory building. 
O.  Accessory dwelling units shall not be held under separate ownership from the single-family dwelling. Either the single-family residence or the accessory dwelling unit, or both, may be rented. In no case shall any rented dwelling unit be rented for a period of less than 31 days. 
P.  Within 30 days following the issuance of a building permit for the accessory dwelling unit, a covenant in a form acceptable to the City shall be recorded against the title in the Los Angeles County Recorder's office, declaring that: (1) the accessory dwelling unit may not be sold, transferred, or assigned separately from the single-family residence; and (2) such restrictions shall run with the land and be binding upon all future owners. A copy of the recorded covenant shall be filed with the office of the City Clerk. 
Q.  Notwithstanding any other development standard required by this section, an accessory dwelling unit that satisfies all of the following requirements shall be approved ministerially with a building permit if: 
1.  It is located on a lot zoned for single-family use that contains a single-family residence; 
2.  It is the only accessory dwelling unit on the lot; 
3.  It is contained within the existing space of an existing residence or accessory building, including, but not limited to, a studio, pool house, or other similar structure. 
4.  It has independent exterior access; and 
5.  It has side and rear setbacks sufficient for fire safety."

F.  To protect commercial properties from fire, explosion, noxious fumes, and other hazards; 
G.  Use and promote open spaces and landscaping to create a visually pleasing environment, as well as to distinguish city and neighborhood boundaries; 
H.  Intensified or regional-relation commercial uses shall be organized and designed to promote maximum opportunity for transit usage; 
I.  Commercial and office developments shall exhibit the highest standards of site planning, architecture and landscape design; 
J.  Enhance the pedestrian experience through well-delineated and design-enhanced pathways from the parking lots to the commercial businesses, and pedestrian connections from the commercial developments to adjacent neighborhoods and districts, and by providing pedestrian amenities that include outdoor seating areas and gathering spaces. 
(Ord. No. 11-388, § 11, 12-14-2011) 
9302. - Commercial districts. 
    The following commercial districts are hereby established: 
A.  CS Commercial shopping center district; 
B.  CRS Commercial retail/service district; 
C.  CS-MU Commercial shopping center-mixed use district; 
D.  CR Commercial recreation district; 
E.  BP-OR Business park-office retail district;

(Ord. No. 11-388, § 11, 12-14-2011; Ord. No. 14-409, § 6, 8-13-2014) 
9303. - Commercial district design standards. 
    The following design standards shall be applicable to any development in all commercial districts. 
9303.1. - Site plan design. 
    All uses and structures not requiring any other discretionary approvals shall not be permitted unless a site plan review is obtained pursuant to the provisions of chapter 6. The following site design criteria shall be utilized in conjunction with the general development standards, as set forth in chapter 6: 
A.  Existing site conditions. Existing site conditions such as mature vegetation, slopes, drainage courses, rock outcropping and views should be all considered as possibilities for inclusion in the project. Use of valuable existing site elements will assist in formulating a focused design theme. 
B.  Building orientation. Placement of the buildings shall be done in a manner compatible with surrounding existing and planned uses and buildings. The setback from streets and adjacent properties is directly proportionate to the scale of the proposed building and those around it. Larger buildings will require more setback area for a balance of scale and for the protection of solar access to the proposed building and adjacent sites. Lastly, placement of the building should provide the most aesthetic public views. 
C.  Access/circulation. The access and circulation of a development should be designed to provide a safe and efficient system, both on and off the site. Points of access shall be designed in conformance with the city access regulations. The circulation system shall be designed to reduce conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic, minimize impacts on adjacent properties, combine circulation and access areas where possible, and provide adequate maneuvering areas. Points of access shall not conflict with other planned or existing access points. Clearly delineated pedestrian connections between business areas and parking areas, and to adjoining neighborhoods and districts shall be provided, which provide safety and amenities to pedestrians. 
D.  Parking areas. The visual prominence of parking areas shall be minimized in the overall design of a project through site design and landscaping. Parking areas should be screened from streets through combinations of mounding, landscaping, low profile walls and grade separations. The design of parking areas shall also minimize auto noise, lights and glare, and ambient air temperature. This can be accomplished through the use of sound walls, site location, use of well-designed lights, and landscaping throughout the parking lot. Parking lots shall incorporate well-designed and articulated pedestrian pathways from the parking areas to the businesses to create a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment. Bicycle parking racks or other public bike storage shall be provided in convenient locations of the development. 
E.  Landscape/open space. Landscaping and open spaces should be designed as an integral part of the overall site plan design. Landscaping and open spaces should enhance the building design, enhance public views and spaces, provide buffers and transitions, provide for a balance of solar uses, and provide screening. Additionally, the landscape design should accent the overall design theme through the use of structures such as arbors or trellises, hardscape, and special paving. 
F.  Walls/screening. The use of any walls should be consistent with the overall design theme. Walls are discouraged unless needed for a specific screening or safety purpose. Where they are needed, color, material and variation of the vertical/horizontal plane are needed to blend with the site and building and design. 
G.  Lighting. On-site lights should provide a safe, functional and aesthetic design. Enough lighting should be provided to ensure a safe environment while at the same time not cause areas of intense light or glare. Fixtures and poles shall be designed and placed in a manner consistent and compatible with the overall site and building design. 
H.  Utilities and ancillary equipment. On-site utilities and equipment shall be located in inconspicuous areas, away from public view, wherever feasible. Where they are located in public view, they shall be screened with a combination of material that best suits the overall design theme. 
I.  Compatibility with adjacent uses. Commercial uses adjoining residential neighborhoods shall be designed to be compatible with the neighborhoods through locating automobile and truck access and unloading areas so that they do not directly front residential uses, or by providing adequate screening of landscaping and/or decorative walls in areas adjacent to the residential uses. 
(Ord. No. 11-388, § 12, 12-14-2011) 
9304. - Building design. 
    In addition to the provision of chapter 6, all buildings constructed in the commercial districts shall conform to the following criteria: 
A.  Design theme. A recognizable design theme shall be established for each building. That theme shall be one which creates a harmonious building style, form, size, color, material and roof line, as it relates to surrounding planned or existing developments. Subtle variations are encouraged which provide visual interest but do not create abrupt changes causing discord in the overall design of the immediate area. It is not intended that one style of architecture should be dominant but that individual structures shall create and enhance a high quality and harmonious community appearance. 
B.  Scale. The mass and scale of the building needs to be proportionate to the site, open spaces, street locations and surrounding developments. No matter what the scale of a building, setbacks and overall heights should provide an element of openness and human scale. Multistory building should be set back toward the center of the site or be designed in a stepped style. 
C.  Materials and colors. Colors, textures and materials shall be coordinated to achieve total compatibility of design. They should blend well with the environment and not cause abrupt changes. 
D.  Signing. Every building shall be designed with a precise concept for adequate signing. Provisions for sign placement, sign scale in relationship with building and readability shall be considered in developing the signing concept. While providing the most effective signing, it shall also be highly compatible with the building and site design relative to color, material and placement. 
E.  Equipment screening. Any equipment, whether on the roof, side of building, or ground, shall be screened. The method of screening shall be architecturally integrated in terms of material, color, shape, and size. The screening design shall blend with the building design. All such equipment on a building shall be screened behind and/or below a permanent part of the main roof. If this is not possible due to elevation, then said equipment shall be placed on the ground. 
F.  Off-street parking and loading requirements. Off-street parking and loading shall be provided as required by chapter 6. 
G.  Utilities. All utilities shall be as provided as required by chapter 6. 
H.  Signs. All signs shall be in compliance with chapter 6. 
9305. - Performance standards. 
    The conduct and operation of all uses in the commercial districts shall comply with the following minimum standards: 
A.  Noise. All operations and businesses shall be conducted to comply with the following standards:

H.  Fire or explosive hazard. All operations or activities shall conform with the minimum requirements of the Uniform Fire Code, and with the provisions of Title 19 of the California Administrative Code. 
I.  Liquid and solid wastes. There shall be no discharge at any point into any public or private sewage disposal system or stream, or into the ground, of any liquid or solid materials except in conformance with the regulations of the water district and building and safety division. 
J.  Outdoor storage, trash areas and service areas. All areas for storage of maintenance equipment or vehicles, refuse storage and collection areas and service areas, shall be enclosed or effectively screened from public view by use of a wall, landscaping, berming or a combination thereof. 
K.  Air quality. No operation or activity shall cause the emission of any smoke, fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases or other forms of air pollution which can cause damage to health, animals, vegetation, or other forms of property, or which can cause excessive soiling on any other lot. No emission shall be permitted which exceeds the requirements of the South Coast air quality management district or the requirements of any air quality plan adopted by the city. 
L.  Heat or cold. No operation or activity shall emit heat which would cause a temperature increase or decrease on any adjacent property in excess of ten (10) degrees Fahrenheit, whether the change is in the air, on the ground, or in any structure.

    The purpose of the CS-MU district shall be to provide for planned shopping centers where the land and compatible retail stores and associated facilities, including multi-family residential units, are designed and developed together as an integrated whole using modern site planning techniques. The allowance for residential units is to encourage improvements to existing shopping centers, and to provide opportunities for an individual to participate in multiple activities on the site, thereby promoting vehicle trip reduction. The primary tenant in the shopping center will usually be a supermarket, or other large retail tenant, and the center will serve primarily the convenience needs, such as food, drugs, hardware, and personal services, of nearby residential areas. The centers shall exhibit a high level of architectural and site design quality, providing a positive experience for visitors and residents of the center and community; fostering economic vitality and businesses activity; and serving as a center of neighborhood identity and activity. Such centers are required to fit into the surrounding residential pattern of development and create neither architectural nor traffic conflicts. Development, remodel and renovation of such centers shall integrate and promote pedestrian activity with pathway connections between center business areas and parking areas, and to adjoining neighborhoods and districts, as well as incorporate pedestrian amenities like seating areas and outdoor gathering spaces to accommodate pedestrians, outdoor dining and other activities. The pathways shall be clearly articulated with enhanced paving and other design features, landscaping, and wayfinding signage. Multi-family residential units may be included in a center, providing that resident-serving amenities are incorporated into the center; the residential and nonresidential uses are compatible; and the residential and nonresidential portions of mixed-use buildings are seamlessly integrated by architectural design, pedestrian walkways, and landscape. For existing shopping centers, residential use may be allowed only if it is part of a substantial and comprehensive redevelopment, remodel or renovation of the shopping center that improves the architectural and site design. In all cases, the residential use shall be ancillary to the commercial uses of the center.

    The purpose of the following standards is to establish minimum criteria for all outdoor recreational uses located in the city to ensure that the completed project will be in harmony with existing or potential uses in the surrounding area and consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the general plan. 
A.  All exterior lighting associated with outdoor recreational uses shall be down lit, shielded and directed away from surrounding properties and public rights-of-way. No light source shall exceed the height of sixteen (16) feet from finished grade. Such lighting shall not blink, flash, oscillate or be of high intensity in brightness. The use of multiple colored lights and overhead rooftop lights is prohibited. Every use shall be operated such that there is no direct light and glare visible beyond the boundaries of the properties. A lighting plan which includes a photometric study shall be required as part of the conditional use permit and must be considered by the planning commission at the same time as the conditional use permit. 
B.  All outdoor recreational uses shall be operated such that no loud speakers, bells, gongs, buzzers, or other noise attention or attracting devices can be heard beyond the boundaries of the property. 
C.  All noise generating equipment exposed to the exterior shall be muffled with sound absorbing materials to minimize noise impacts on adjacent properties. When the outdoor use abuts commercial or industrial properties, all outdoor equipment and activities shall not create any noise that would exceed an exterior noise level of sixty (60) DBA during the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and sixty-five (65) DBA during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. When the outdoor use abuts residential properties, all outdoor equipment and activities shall not create any noise that would exceed an exterior noise level of fifty (50) DBA during the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and fifty-five (55) DBA during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Incidental outdoor recreational uses shall be confined to an area or areas not exceeding a combined area of twenty (20) percent of the total outdoor area of the site. Examples of incidental outdoor recreational uses include but are not limited to batting cages, miniature cars, bumper cars and boats (so long as they are not internal combustion engine powered); and amusement rides. Incidental outdoor recreational uses shall also include related infrastructure, such as walkways, bridges, landscaping, hardscaping and waterscaping. For purposes of this subsection, the total outdoor area: (i) shall not include areas occupied by buildings with permanent walls and roofs; (ii) shall not include setback areas, parking areas, or driveway areas; and (iii) shall include all other outdoor areas whether or not used for recreational activities. 
J.  Incidental outdoor recreational uses shall be located away from the perimeter of the site. The miniature golf use shall be located along the entire street perimeter of the site in order to screen and buffer any incidental outdoor recreational uses, and related buildings and structures. 
K.  In order for an activity to be considered indoor it must be conducted entirely within a building with permanent walls and roof. 
L.  Primary batting cage facilities may include certain incidental uses such as pitching or practice cages, a practice and instructional recreational field, an office, an eating and nonalcoholic drinking establishment. Primary batting cage facilities shall be screened from view from the freeway by landscaping, decorative fences or walls, and/or placement of structures on the site.

9497.4. - Agoura Village Cost Recovery Fee. 
A.  Purpose and overview. The purpose of the cost recovery fee is to allow the city of Agoura Hills to recover the costs for preparing and implementing the Agoura Village Specific Plan, as well as other various related planning and environmental costs. The Agoura Village Specific Plan addresses the need to create a mix of uses that offer a town center and a pedestrian-friendly environment at a key location in the city, and results in enhanced public facilities and design features within the Agoura Village area. Since all property owners within the project area will benefit from these enhancements, the processing costs will be spread equitably among all property owners. 
B.  Applicability. The applicant for any building permit and/or discretionary land use permit for new construction on property located in whole or in part within the Agoura Village Specific Plan zone shall pay the Agoura Village Cost Recovery Fee at the same time and in the same manner as building permit and other development fees. 
C.  Agoura Village Reimbursable Expenditures. As shown in Table 1, the costs to be recovered are estimated at four hundred ninety seven thousand and seven hundred thirty-one dollars ($497,731.00), and include the costs of preparing and implementing the strategic action plan, costs for design assistance and financial plan preparation, and costs for roundabout design and traffic engineering. The costs to be recovered are documented and such documentation is on file in the department of community development.

D.  Agoura Village Description. The land uses utilized in the EIR are summarized in Table 2. As shown, there is an estimated eight hundred forty-six thousand and two hundred eight (846,208) square feet included in the Agoura Village project development. The area encompasses about ninety-eight (98) acres, of which about forty (40) acres is developable. This represents the total square feet under build out conditions. About thirty-two (32) percent of the land use is allocated to residential use, with about sixty-eight (68) percent to retail use.

E.  Allocation methodology. Fees have been estimated by spreading the costs on an equitable basis using square footage. Fee allocation based on square footage provides a more equitable distribution of costs than fee allocation based on developable acreage. The estimated costs of four hundred ninety-seven thousand and seven hundred thirty-one dollars ($497,731.00) have been allocated over the different square footages estimated for Agoura Village. The cost recovery fee based on square footage is estimated at $0.5882 per square foot.

PART 5. - FC FREEWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT 

9541. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the freeway corridor overlay district shall be to recognize the importance of the land use, architectural design, and appearance of development within the freeway corridor to the city's image, to establish special design guidelines for all development within said areas, and to establish findings that will ensure that future developments are compatible with the city's historic character. 
    The areas within the freeway corridor overlay district are "gateways"; they are seen first by visitors and residents as they pass through the city, and as they exit the freeway to enter the city. These areas are of crucial importance in establishing the city's identity and character in the minds of visitors and residents. 
(Ord. No. 98-278, § 1, 1-14-98) 
9541.1. - Corridor standards. 
    All development in the FC overlay district shall provide for: 
A.  The use of naturalistic and native landscaping, particularly native oaks, throughout the development; 
B.  Preservation of key distant vistas, such as the Santa Monica Mountains and the Simi Hills; 
C.  Preservation of local landmarks in terms of visibility, including Ladyface Mountain and Strawberry Hill; 
D.  Preservation of designated open space corridors and trails; 
E.  Installation and maintenance of landscaping, including street trees, center median treatment and parkway treatment; 
F.  Use of compatible colors and materials to preserve and enhance the scenic quality of the freeway corridor; 
G.  Total screening of all unsightly uses with berms, decorative walls and/or landscaping. 
9542. - Permitted uses. 
    Except for the following, all uses permitted in the underlying district shall be permitted in this district. 
9542.1. - Prohibited uses. 
    In addition to the prohibited uses in the underlying district, the following are prohibited in the FC overlay district: 
A.  Cabarets, adult book stores, adult entertainment, adult theater and similar adult uses, outdoor displays except new car franchise dealerships, mini storage facilities and yards, truck and equipment rentals, and the like. 
B.  Off-sale alcoholic beverage establishments. This section shall not apply to the wholesale sale of alcoholic beverages or to the sale of alcoholic beverages which are wrapped or otherwise enclosed in a sealed container and sold as part of a gift package or other goods, only where there is no public display of alcoholic beverages where the sale of such items is incidental to the primary business on the premises, and where the sales of such items do not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the gross sales of the business at said location. This section shall also not apply to supermarket/food stores with a floor area greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet. 
(Ord. No. 130, § 1, 7-29-87; Ord. No. 150, § 1, 5-11-88; Ord. No. 09-362, § 4, 7-8-09) 
9543. - Distance limitations. 
    The FC overlay district shall be applied only to six hundred sixty (660) feet north and south of the right-of-way edge of the Ventura (101) Freeway. 
9544. - Development standards. 
    Whichever is greater, the development standards of the underlying district or the following shall apply: 
9544.1. - Relation to the freeway. 
    All development adjacent to the freeway in the FC overlay district shall provide for: 
A.  A setback of all structures from the freeway right-of-way of one (1) foot for each two (2) feet of building height, with a minimum of twenty (20) feet, for one (1) story, and two (2) feet of setback per one (1) foot of building height for any building taller than twenty (20) feet. 
B.  The installation and maintenance of landscaping and automatic irrigation system in the freeway right-of-way, subject to the approval of the city and California Department of Transportation. If such installation is not possible, then the equivalent landscaping shall be provided on the subject property. 
C.  The provision of a six-foot high decorative wall or equivalent berming and planting for the full frontage of the freeway. 
9545. - Conditional uses. 
    The following development shall be subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to Agoura Hills Municipal Code Sections 9545.1 and 9673, et seq.: 
A.  The development either: 
(i)  Includes a freestanding structure with a total building area of sixty thousand (60,000) square feet or more; or 
(ii)  Includes structures with a cumulative total building area of one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet or more; 
AND 
B.  The development is located, in part or in full, in the CS, CR or CRS zones of the FC overlay district. 
    For the purposes of this section, in order for a structure to be considered "freestanding" it should have sufficient distance from an adjacent structure to provide separate visual identity. 
(Ord. No. 98-278, § 2, 1-14-98) 
9545.1. - Findings. 
    In addition to the findings required by Agoura Hills Municipal Code Section 9673.2.E, the planning commission shall make the following findings before granting a conditional use permit: 
1.  The project is compatible with the city's semi-rural character and does not overwhelm the city's low-intensity development style. 
2.  The project's features and space enhance the site so that the buildings are integral parts of the community fabric. To the maximum extent feasible, taking into consideration more than just economic feasibility, the project is situated on the site to maximize the views of the city's points of natural scenic beauty, such as Medea Creek, Ladyface Mountain or Strawberry Hill. 
3.  Parking areas provide safe and convenient access. Parking areas are situated on the site and landscaped to avoid vast expanses of uninterrupted parking spaces. A parking study shall be prepared to determine parking adequacy. 
4.  The site design works with the characteristics of the existing terrain and maximizes preservation of open space to the maximum extent feasible, taking into consideration more than just economic feasibility. The existing terrain and natural contours have been incorporated into the site plan design to maximum extent feasible, taking into consideration more than just economic feasibility. Where features of special interest such as hillsides, streams, or oak trees exist on the project site, they have been integrated into the design. The planning commission has the discretion to impose conditions as it may deem to be necessary to minimize and mitigate grading, the use of retaining walls, and the use of large flat pads. 
5.  The project design avoids or mitigates significant impacts to sensitive or endangered plants and animals and sensitive plant communities such as oak woodlands or riparian habitat. 
6.  The development design conveys the high quality image envisioned in the general plan. Views of the site from the freeway, city gateways, and abutting residential areas compliment and enhance the city's low intensity and semi-rural character. Line of sight studies shall be prepared to determine the visual impacts of the project. 
7.  Building facades are articulated on all sides: There are no long, unbroken facades. The building facades are of natural, non-reflective or low-reflective materials such as wood, stone, brick, or textured concrete. The building's predominant colors are subtle, neutral, or earth tone. Variations in roof lines are used to add interest to and reduce the massive scale of large buildings. Roof features compliment the character of adjoining neighborhoods. 
8.  Landscaping compliments the natural setting of the region. 
9.  Traffic, light, noise, and other environmental impacts shall be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible, taking into consideration more than just economic feasibility. A project shall not be approved if, after implementation of any required traffic mitigation measures, the project's traffic will significantly reduce the existing level of service on any local street in a residential neighborhood. A traffic study shall be prepared to determine impacts and identify mitigation measures. 
10.  If any point on any lot line of any parcel on which the development is proposed to be located is within five hundred (500) feet of any point on any lot line of any residentially zoned property (including property in any open space district in which residential uses are permitted or conditionally permitted), the project is compatible with residential uses. This finding is imposed in recognition of the impact of such developments on residential uses, including impacts on local street traffic, noise, light, security, view corridors, and other environmental impacts. The planning commission has the discretion to impose such conditions as it may deem to be necessary to ensure compatibility with residential uses, including but not limited to conditions relating to: 
(i)  The size, scale and configuration of the development; 
(ii)  Glare on residential properties from outdoor lighting; 
(iii)  Noise from loading docks, parking areas, and other outdoor areas of the development; 
(iv)  Security in the neighborhood; 
(v)  Traffic and circulation in the neighborhood; 
(vi)  Landscaping and other design features to buffer the aesthetic impacts on residential properties; and 
(vii)  Other environmental impacts.

The provisions of chapter 7 shall regulate nonconforming uses and structures. 
DIVISION 2. - STREET IMPROVEMENTS 

9602. - Provision of street dedication and improvements. 
    The existence of inadequate street widths and improvements in the right-of-way adjoining buildings, dwellings and other structures within the city, and the lack of adequate sidewalks, trails, curbs, gutters, tie-in pavement, drainage facilities, street lights, trees and other landscaping, and traffic signage and striping is found and declared to be dangerous to the public health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city. 
9602.1. - Duty to improve. 
    Except as otherwise provided, every owner, lessee or other person constructing or substantially modifying or causing to be constructed or substantially modified, any building, structure or off-street parking facility in the city shall also provide for the construction of necessary curbs, gutters, drainage facilities, sidewalks, trails, pavement, street lights, trees and other landscaping, and traffic signage and striping. The improvements shall be made in accordance with city standards, specifications and design for all public and private street frontage adjoining the property upon which the construction is to be done. For the purposes of this section, substantial modification shall mean any expansion of the square footage of the building or structure, or parking facility. 
9602.2. - Duty to dedicate and improve additional property. 
    Where it is found by the city that the proposed improvements or use of property will cause an increase in vehicular or pedestrian traffic which will constitute an additional burden upon existing streets and create the need for additional right-of-way, street extensions or other required improvements, the property owner shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way and provide the full improvements specified in section 9602.1 for the full width of the adjoining streets. 
    Further, the reviewing may require, as part of development, the recording of an agreement providing that the subject property will participate in any assessment district subsequently formed by the city to make improvements to the city's transportation system that will benefit such property.

DIVISION 2. - HILLSIDE AND SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AREAS 

9652. - Hillside management and significant ecological areas-Purpose. 
    Natural hillside terrain dominate the landscape of a major portion of the city. Significant ecological areas (SEA) provide a unique resource. Together they provide an atmosphere and character that residents have expressed a desire to protect. Therefore, special regulations are hereby established that will protect these two (2) resources from incompatible development and preserve the natural terrain, quality environment, and aesthetic character while encouraging creative, innovative and safe residential development. 
9652.5. - Policy. 
    Either a conditional use permit or an architectural review approval shall be obtained before the issuance of any building or grading permit, approval of minor land division or subdivision, importation of fill material for the purpose of altering natural terrain, or commencement of any construction or enlargement of any building or structure on any parcel that is in, or partly in, a hillside area or SEA. In addition to preserving the natural character of the hillsides and valleys within the City of Agoura Hills and ensuring the preservation of the scenic viewshed, hillside development regulations are designed to protect residents from geologic hazards, such as unstable soils and erosion, and the possible loss of life and destruction of property. 
    The intention and policy of the city is to: 
1.  Encourage minimal grading which relates to the natural contours of the land as opposed to padding or stairstep grading; 
2.  Require the retention of trees and other vegetation which stabilize hillsides, retain moisture, prevent erosion, and enhance the natural scenic beauty, and, when necessary, require additional landscaping to promote the above; 
3.  Require immediate planting whenever appropriate to maintain cut and fill slopes; 
4.  Encourage a variety of building types and design to reduce grading and disturbance of the natural character of the area; and 
5.  Require the retention of natural landmarks and prominent natural features which enhance the character of a specific area. 
A.  Permitted uses. Subject to the provisions of site plan review, the following shall be permitted uses in hillside and significant ecological areas: 
1.  Accessory buildings and structures less than five hundred (500) square feet in gross floor area related to existing dwellings or commercial development; 
2.  Other additions or modifications to existing structures provided said area does not exceed the lesser of seven hundred (700) square feet in gross floor area, or thirty (30) percent of the existing gross floor area and does not increase the number of families that can reside therein. 
9652.10. - Same-Additional regulations. 
    Except as specified in section 9652.5, prior to the issuance of any building or grading permits, approval of a minor land division or subdivision, or the commencement of any construction or enlargement of any building or structure on a lot or parcel of land which is in or partly in an area designated in the general plan and related maps as a significant ecological area or within a hillside area as defined herein, either a conditional use permit or architectural review approval shall be obtained as provided by this section. Development standards, lot size, height and setbacks may be modified by the planning commission in order to achieve the purposes of this chapter. 
A.  A conditional use permit shall be required in the following cases: 
1.  In hillside areas where the parcel of land contains an area of five (5) acres or greater; 
2.  In hillside areas where the parcel of land contains an area of less than five (5) acres whenever the density or open space requirements of this section would prohibit the use of such parcel otherwise permitted by this chapter; 
3.  In hillside areas whenever a major slope failure occurs on a developed parcel of land regardless of the size of such parcel; and 
4.  In significant ecological areas regardless of the size of the parcel of land. 
B.  Architectural review approval pursuant to sections of the Agoura Hills Municipal Code shall be required in hillside areas not subject to the requirement of a conditional use permit pursuant to subsection A, above. 
9652.12. - Definition. 
    The following definitions shall be applicable in hillside and significant ecological areas: 
A.  "Concave lot" shall mean a parcel of land with a bowl-shaped depression or formation in which the midpoint elevation of the property is lower than the average elevation of the property lines that are located adjacent to a street. 
B.  "Hillside area" shall mean a parcel of land, not subject to recorded development restrictions, having an average slope before grading, of greater than ten (10) percent. The average slope of a parcel of land is the relationship between the change in elevation of the land and the horizontal distance over which that change in elevation occurs and shall be computed by the application of the following formula to a contour map of the natural slope of such land: 
S = IL × 100 
  A 
When S = Average percent slope When I = Contour line elevation interval in feet When L = Sum of the length of all contour lines across the parcel When A = Net area* of parcel in square feet  
*The area of any existing private or public streets shall be excluded in calculating the net area of the property proposed for development. 
In determining the average slope of property, property may be divided into smaller areas based upon percentage of slope and any areas with a percentage of slope greater than thirty-five (35) percent may be excluded before the average slope formula is applied. These excluded areas shall be designated as open space and not considered as a part of the development. If this approach is utilized, the dwelling density table may be applied to each of the designated smaller areas and the sum of the smaller areas shall be the designated density for the total property. A conditional use permit shall be required for this process to allow deletion, when appropriate of slope areas greater than thirty-five (35) percent from the average slope calculation. In reviewing the conditional use permit, the overall size of the property, viability, visual value, aesthetic value, location and any other relevant factors of the proposed open space area in relation to the adjacent open space areas shall be considered. 
C.  "Major slope failure" means the movement of an existing slope that results in a hazard to an existing habitable structure as determined by the building official. 
D.  "Natural slope" means the natural or existing contours of the land, including the natural or existing vegetation. 
E.  "Recorded development restrictions" means a grant by an instrument whereby the owner relinquishes to the public, either in perpetuity or for a term of years, the right to construct improvements upon the land except as may be expressly reserved in the instrument and which contains covenants with the city, running with the land, either in perpetuity or for a term of (1) not to construct or permit the construction of any improvements, except as such right is expressly reserved in the instrument and except for public service facilities installed for the benefit of the land subject to such covenant or public service facilities installed pursuant to an authorization by the city council or the public utilities commission; and (2) against the extraction of natural resources or other activities which may destroy the unique physical and scenic characteristics of the land including but not limited to the cutting of trees and other natural growth, except as may be required for fire prevention, elimination of diseased growth and similar protective measures. Any subsequent reservation shall not permit any action which will materially impair the open space character of the land.

Pre-graded pads that existed prior to January 1, 1999 shall be exempted from the above maximum allowable floor area ratio limitations. The director of planning and community development has the discretion to exclude concave lots with an average slope greater than ten (10) percent from the above maximum floor area ratio limitations. 
C.  Circulation. 
1.  Streets within any project proposed in a hillside area shall be designed and constructed to accomplish the following purposes: 
(a)  Minimize grading so as to compliment the natural features of the hillsides and reflect a rural rather than an urban character. 
(b)  Permit safe and efficient travel for motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians, and to provide access for emergency vehicles. 
2.  In order to accomplish the purposes of this subsection, all streets in a hillside area development shall be designed, where possible, to: 
(a)  Parallel the natural contours and natural grades of the land. Streets running perpendicular to the grade of the slope shall be avoided, when feasible, to reduce grading and aid in drainage. When streets must cut across grade contours, the principle of grading shall be half cut/half fill at locations not visible to a large area. Bridges shall be provided when streets must cross drainage ways and ravines of exceptional environmental setting. 
(b)  Use split level streets when access to abutting parcels of land is from other streets to avoid excess cut and fill and minimize scarring effects of hillside development. 
(c)  Provide a minimum sight distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet for all horizontal and vertical curves. The minimum centerline curve radius on residential streets shall be one hundred (100) feet. Reversed curves shall be connected with tangents as long as practicable. All major streets shall be designed to incorporate curves greater than the minimum to provide for increased traffic flow. 
(d)  Have a maximum centerline grade for streets of fifteen (15) percent except at intersections and areas of transition where the gradient shall be zero to two (2) percent. Maximum grade for major streets shall be less than twelve (12) percent. Changes in grade of more than five-tenths of one (1) percent shall be connected by vertical curves conforming to standard sight distances. 
(e)  Provide adequate private off-street parking to minimize the need for parking on narrow hillside streets. Parallel parking on the hillside streets may be eliminated in order to reduce road width in critical areas in which even parking spaces shall be provided in off-street bays at more suitable locations. 
(f)  Provide sidewalks and walkways in accordance with a pedestrian circulation plan that is not dependent upon and identical to the plan for vehicular circulation. 
(g)  Provide bicycle and equestrian trails where appropriate. 
(h)  Provide hillside public streets with street lighting designed to lessen the impact on views. 
(i)  Discourage the protrusion of streets on ridgelines. 
D.  View preservation. View preservation shall take into consideration existing residences, views from scenic roadways, and the freeways. Such provisions as increased setbacks to minimize mass, utilizing natural earth and berms to reduce prominence in viewshed, and the retention of natural land form features shall be used. In addition, viewshed in a hillside area shall be protected by: 
1.  Facing dwelling units onto open, green or view areas; 
2.  Locating dwelling units in such a manner as to avoid obstructing the view from other dwelling units; 
3.  Locating structures with a minimum building setback of thirty (30) feet to the top of the slope, for properties zoned commercial or business park. Pre-graded pads which existed prior to January 1, 1999 shall be exempted from this provision. 
E.  Fire protection. The following requirements shall apply in a hillside area: 
1.  Clearance of brush or vegetative growth from the vicinity of structures and roadways shall be in accordance with the Fire Code and approved by the city; 
2.  Roofs shall be of fire retardant material in accordance with the requirements of the Building Code. Block walls or other fire resistant walls shall be constructed between a dwelling and any adjacent areas of known fire hazard such as open space areas; 
3.  All easements for firebreaks shall be dedicated in writing for this purpose and recorded with the Los Angeles County recorder; 
4.  Special design restrictions shall apply in brush fire areas where narrow canyons act as chimneys, funneling hot winds up the canyons to the ridge. Stilt and cantilevered structures proposed to be constructed on canyon slopes shall be discouraged. Any single-family residential dwelling built on a ridge at the top of such a canyon shall be set back thirty (30) feet from the slope of the canyon rim. 
F.  Erosion control. 
1.  All manufactured slopes shall be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm runoff and erosion within thirty (30) days after completion of any grading. Such planting shall be designed to blend with the surrounding terrain and the character of development; 
2.  The face of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and maintained by the developer so as to control erosion until such time as the parcel of land is occupied. Such control measures may consist of effective planting or soil reinforcement. The protection for the slopes shall be installed as soon as practicable after the completion of any grading but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter; 
3.  Other erosion devices, when necessary, such as check drains, debris basins, cribbing, or other devices or methods to control erosion and provide safety, shall be installed or implemented at the direction of the building official. 
G.  Drainage control. 
1.  All drainage and terracing in a hillside area shall meet or exceed the requirements of existing standards and codes; 
2.  Drainage devices shall be placed on graded slopes as inconspicuously as possible. In addition: 
(a)  Down drains shall be placed in swales; 
(b)  Sides of any drain which are visible from a public way shall be concealed as much as possible. Vegetation landscaping also shall be used, when feasible, to conceal drains and terraces; 
(c)  Concrete in any drain or terrace shall be tinted to blend with the landscape; 
(d)  Drain slope gradients may become steeper as the drain moves down the slope. However, all drain gradients shall be approved by the city; 
(e)  All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry water to the nearest practicable drainage way approved by the city; 
(f)  Erosion shall be prevented by installation of nonerosive down drains or other drain devices; 
(g)  Each building pad shall have a drainage gradient of at least two (2) percent toward the street or toward an approved engineered drainage facility; 
(h)  Interceptor drains shall be installed along the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area slopes toward the cut, and has a drainage path greater than forty (40) feet measured horizontally. Interceptor drains shall be paved with a minimum of three (3) inches of reinforced concrete or gunite, be at least one (1) foot in depth and at least thirty (30) inches in width. All slopes of drain terraces and interceptor drains, shall be approved by the building official; 
3.  Streets and sidewalk drains shall be designed to contain and control the one-hundred-year frequency storm including debris production in accordance with the Los Angeles County flood control district design manual and to be usable during the maximum design storm. All developed properties shall drain toward the street or a storm drain; 
4.  Terracing for cut and fill slopes shall be in conformance with the provisions of the city's grading ordinances and the following: 
(a)  Terraces at least eight (8) feet wide shall be constructed on all cut and fill slopes that are twenty-five (25) feet or less in height, in order to control surface drainage and debris. Where only one (1) terrace is required, however, it shall be at midheight of the slope. 
(b)  If higher slopes are ever permitted by whatever method, the following shall be permitted: cut or fill slopes of greater than twenty-five (25) feet and less than one hundred (100) feet in vertical height shall be constructed with a minimum of one (1) terrace of not less than twelve (12) feet in width at midheight of the slope. The spacing and width of terraces on cut or fill slopes greater than one hundred (100) feet in height shall be designed by a civil engineer. 
(c)  All swales or ditches located on a terrace shall be a minimum of one (1) foot in depth and a minimum of five (5) feet in width and shall have a gradient of between four (4) percent and twelve (12) percent. Every swale and ditch shall be paved with concrete not less than three (3) inches thick reinforced with six-inch by six-inch, ten-gauge welded wire fabric or equivalent reinforcement. 
(d)  A single runoff swale or ditch shall not collect runoff from a contributing area in excess of thirteen thousand five hundred (13,500) square feet without discharge into a structured downdrain system. 
(e)  Subsurface drainage of cut and fill slopes shall be required if in the opinion of a geologist and/or soil engineer such drainage is necessary. 
(f)  Subdrains shall be designed and constructed when fill is to be placed in natural drainage courses or in other areas where seepage is evident. 
H.  Ridgelines. The development of primary and secondary ridgelines as specified in the city's general plan shall be discouraged. This prohibition shall include, all buildings, solid fencing or walls, paved roads, exotic landscaping, water tanks, and the like which would noticeably detract from the natural skyline. 
I.  Building Design. 
1.  Architectural enrichments and variations in roof massing are encouraged. Roofs shall minimize their visual impact by keeping a low profile and the roof pitch shall follow the slope of the hillside instead of being perpendicular to the hillside or opposing the hillside slope. Upper stories should not be cantilevered out in the opposite direction of the hillside slope. 
2.  Avoid large expanses of a single material on walls, roofs, or paving areas. Create interesting, small scale patterns by breaking up building mass, varying building materials, and through design and placement of windows and doors. 
3.  Provide architectural treatment to all sides of a structure. Elements of architectural treatment used on the front facade shall be repeated on all sides of a structure with additional emphasis on those elevations visible from adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. 
4.  Building materials and color schemes shall blend with the natural landscape. Colors shall be earth tones and the specific hues shall be compatible with the surrounding natural environment. 
J.  Landscaping. 
1.  Native or naturalized plants, or other plant species that blend naturally with the landscape shall be used. 
2.  Natural landform planting shall be used to soften the impact of development and provide erosion control. These landscape techniques shall serve to reintroduce landscape patterns that occur in nature including concentrating trees and shrubs in concave areas while convex portions are planted mainly with ground cover. 
3.  Trees and shrubs are to be arranged in informal masses and shall be placed selectively to reduce the scale of long, steep slopes. 
4.  Berming shall be incorporated into the grading plans to help soften the appearance of buildings from public view.

9653 - Transfer of development regulations; purpose. 
    To provide a procedure whereby development credits may be transferred from open space parcels which, because of visibility, access, geology, slope or other factors, are desirable to retain as open space, to other parcels not located in a hillside area or SEA and, furthermore, to provide conditions for ownership and use of open space. 
9653.1. - Definitions. 
A.  Donor parcel. Parcel from which development credits are transferred. 
B.  Receiver parcel. Parcel to which development credits are transferred. 
C.  Development credit. A development credit is a potential entitlement to construct one (1) dwelling unit on property in the OS district, which can only be exercised when the development credit has been transferred pursuant to the provisions of this section from a donor to a receiver parcel and all other requirements of law are fulfilled. 
9653.2. - Applicability. 
    The transfer of development credits may be authorized when the following conditions are met: 
A.  Donor parcels are within the OS district; 
B.  Receiver parcels are in the RS, RM, RMH or RH districts; 
C.  The city council, after recommendation by the planning commission, finds the receiver parcel has sufficient area designated in the general plan to accommodate development otherwise permitted under city regulations plus the development credits to be transferred, and that such total development meets all of the applicable requirements of the city's general plan and regulations. 
9653.3. - Procedure. 
    The transfer of development credits shall be authorized as part of a development agreement. A development agreement application shall include both the donor and receiver parcels. 
9653.4. - Provisions governing donor parcel. 
A.  When development credits are transferred, all such credits for a parcel shall be transferred and they are thereafter extinguished with regard to the donor parcel. 
B.  The number of development credits which may be transferred shall not exceed the number of dwelling units provided for in section 9652.13. 
C.  The fee title to the donor parcel may, upon approval of the city, be retained by the owner of the donor parcel, be transferred to the receiver parcel, be transferred to a quasi-public agency or private institution or body, or be transferred to a public body. Approval by the city must be based on findings that the option is consistent with the general plan and provides for the longterm maintenance of the property as open space. 
D.  The donor parcel, after development credits have been extinguished, shall be kept in a natural condition. However, the city may, pursuant to a conditional use permit, authorize the following uses if it deems they are compatible with maintaining the natural condition of the property and are consistent with the general plan: 
1.  Watershed 
2.  Pasture 
3.  Trails 
4.  Other uses of a similar nature 
5.  Such accessory uses as are necessary to support those uses specified in the above subparagraphs. 
E.  Parcels 1 and 4 above, from which development credits have been transferred shall be made subject to open space easements dedicated to the city or other agreements with the city, which ensure that such parcels remain as open space in perpetuity. 
9653.5. - Provisions governing receiver parcel. 
A.  The maximum number of allowable dwelling units that may be transferred to a receiver parcel shall not be in excess of twenty (20) percent of the density otherwise prescribed for that parcel. 
B.  These provisions shall not affect the receiver parcel and shall comply with all low-moderate income housing requirements of this article. 
C.  The transfer shall not unduly increase the mass, population density or intensity of use on the receiver parcel to the detriment of neighboring properties. 
9653.6. - Findings. 
    Before approving the transfer of development rights, the city must find that: 
A.  The transfer will result in the dedication, protection, and preservation of open space; 
B.  Appropriate guarantees exist and will be provided to ensure that the transfer conforms to the intent and purposes of the general plan; 
C.  The transfer will not result in a detrimental effect on the area surrounding the receiver parcel. 
9653.7. - Example of transfer of development rights from donor parcel to receiver parcel. 
    Donor parcel, located within the OS district, is entitled "X" number of dwelling units. Receiver parcel, located within either the RS, RM, RMH or RH districts is entitled "Y" number of units. Subject to prior city approval the donor parcel can transfer its "X" number of units to the receiver parcel. Receiver parcel may be approved for its "Y" number of units, plus the "X" number of units not to exceed twenty (20) percent more than the density otherwise prescribed for the receiver. 
9653.8. - Rules and procedures. 
    The council may adopt those rules and procedures it considers necessary to implement these provisions to facilitate the transfer of allowable development. Such rules and procedures shall be adopted by resolution.

(Ord. No. 93-226U, § 3, 3-10-93) 
9654.2. - General standards. 
    Accessible off-street parking areas shall be provided and maintained as set forth in this section. Parking access areas shall provide parking and maneuvering room for motor vehicles and for pedestrian safety based on the anticipated occupancy of the related building, structure or area of land or water. Where there is a combination of principal uses in any one (1) facility, the sum of the parking requirements of these uses shall be provided unless otherwise provided. If the calculation of parking requirements results in the requirement for a fraction of a parking space, such parking space need not be provided unless the fraction exceeds fifty (50) percent. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the installation and maintenance of more parking spaces than the minimum required. 
A.  Seats or seating capacity. Where the standards for parking set forth in this section are based upon seating capacity, the capacity shall be determined by reference to the actual seating capacity of the subject area based upon the number of seats or one (1) seat per eighteen (18) inches of bench or pew length and one (1) seat per twenty-four (24) inches of booth length for dining, but in no case shall seating be less than as required by the Uniform Building Code. For other areas where seats are not fixed, the seating capacity shall be determined in accordance with the Uniform Building Code. 
B.  Planter or landscaped areas. Where the standards set forth in this section or elsewhere in this Code require the installation of planters or landscaped areas within or adjacent to parking areas, such planters or landscaped areas shall be planted, irrigated and maintained with live landscaping such as lawn, ground cover, trees or shrubs, and surrounded by a six-inch-high curb. The landscaped areas shall not be less than the width specified excluding any perimeter curbing. Parking in the oak tree drip lines shall be discouraged and regulated by the provisions of section 9657 et seq. 
C.  Building permit. Plans submitted for a building permit to construct a building which has public parking areas shall include the design of the required parking area drawn to scale. Such plans shall include all parking spaces and maneuvering areas, curb cuts, landscaping and other improvements. The building permit shall not be issued until such parking plans have been approved by the director of planning and community development or his or her designee and no final completion inspection shall be approved until the parking spaces and required landscaping are installed. 
D.  Change of occupancy. Whenever the parking demand is increased due to a change of occupancy which does not involve any new construction requiring a building permit, the director of planning and community development or his or her designee shall review the parking requirements of the proposed use if new business license is required for the change of use. In such case no new business license shall be issued until the department of planning and community development has approved the parking plan. Two (2) copies of such plan drawn to scale shall be submitted to the director of planning and community development or his or her designee for approval. The plan shall show the entire subject property and shall show the means of ingress and egress, location of the building, parking spaces, landscaping, barrier curbs, irrigation system, lights and any other proposed facilities. The plan shall be approved if it conforms to the intent and provisions of this part. 
E.  Parking reductions. A proponent of a business or industrial project may provide alternative facilities or programs which serve to reduce parking demand or return for a reduction in vehicle parking requirements, subject to the provisions below. Vehicle parking requirements shall be reduced in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  Preferred carpool/vanpool parking spaces. The parking requirements for developments which guarantee preferred parking spaces (e.g., covered, shaded, or near building entrance) to employees who participate regularly in a carpool or vanpool shall be reduced by one (1) vehicle space for every one (1) space which is marked and reserved for carpools/vanpools at a preferred location provided that the maximum reduction shall not exceed two (2) percent of the required parking. 
2.  Request for special review of parking. Parking reductions exceeding the maximums specified in subparagraph (1) above, or modifications of parking improvement requirements, may be granted by the planning commission, whenever such reduction or modification is considered in connection with a review of site plans by the commission, or is heard in connection with a rezoning, use permit, or variance. Such reduction or modifications shall only be permitted in unusual circumstances. The project proponent shall submit with the request whatever evidence and documentation is necessary to demonstrate that unusual conditions warrant a parking reduction, such as the multiple use of a parking area by uses having peak parking demands which occur at different times; floor plans which indicate that the floor area devoted to customer or employee use is less typical for the building proposed; or that other programs will be implemented by the developer or tenant(s) which will result in a demand for parking at the site which is less than would otherwise occur, such as the provision of monetary incentives to employees who regularly utilize public transit or participate in a carpool or vanpool. 
The recordation of agreements or covenants, prior to issuance of a building permit, which ensures that appropriate programs are implemented for the life of the use shall be required as a condition of approval of the parking reduction. 
F.  Existing facilities. Any building or use for which parking facilities become substandard by the adoption of this part shall be considered a nonconforming use. Such nonconforming use may continue, but no enlargement or expansion shall be made in such use or building, unless the required number of parking spaces or parking areas imposed by this part are provided. Any change of occupancy or use in an existing building or lot which requires more parking space shall provide the additional parking areas required by this section. 
G.  Parking of nonregistered vehicles. Automotive vehicles or trailers of any kind or type without current registration shall not be parked or stored in the front yard or side street yard of any lot. 
H.  Change of parking requirements. The amendment of the parking requirements set forth in this section shall not render a use previously approved in accordance with the provisions of this section nonconforming. 
I.  Tandem parking. Except where specifically permitted by this section, parking spaces shall not be in tandem. All parking spaces shall be free of obstructions, and parking shall be accomplished in a continuous forward movement. Tandem parking shall mean one (1) parking space located behind another parking space which has no direct access to the driveway or street. 
J.  Provisions for residential uses. 
1.  Parking locations. Off-street parking spaces for single-family detached dwellings shall be located on the same lot or parcel on which the dwelling is located. Off-street parking spaces for all other dwellings shall be located on the same development site and on the same lot or parcel or not more than two hundred (200) feet from the lot or parcel on which the dwelling is located. 
2.  Senior citizen parking. The planning commission may reduce the total number of parking spaces required for senior citizen housing by up to twenty-five (25) percent, based upon a finding that the proposed development is located within five hundred (500) feet of a shopping center or is served adequately by a transportation system. The number of spaces which are required to be covered may be reduced by up to fifty (50) percent, based upon evidence submitted by the developer that the reduction is directly related toward providing dwelling units to meet the needs of low and moderate income senior citizen households as defined and provided for in the housing element of the General Plan. In no instance shall the number of covered parking spaces be fewer than one (1) per four (4) dwelling units. 
3.  Commercial vehicles in residential zones. No vehicle which is registered for commercial purposes pursuant to applicable provisions of the Vehicle Code, which exceeds five thousand five hundred (5,500) pounds in unladen gross weight, shall be parked or such vehicles left standing on any residentially zoned property in excess of thirty (30) consecutive minutes, unless the actual loading or unloading of such vehicle is in progress on such property, or is fully screened from view from any public street. Violation of this section is an infraction and shall be punishable as provided in section 1200(b) of the Agoura Hills Municipal Code. 
4.  Assigned spaces. One (1) of the required parking spaces for each multifamily dwelling unit shall be an assigned parking space, not more than two hundred (200) feet away from the unit to be served. 
K.  Provisions for commercial uses. 
1.  Parking locations. In commercial zones off-street parking shall be located on the same lot as, or on a lot contiguous to, the building, structure, or use to be served. 
2.  Spaces not for repair, servicing or storage. Required parking spaces shall not be used, or be permitted to be used, for the repair, servicing, or storage of vehicles or for the storage of materials. 
3.  Racks not counted as parking spaces. For auto repair shops or other similar uses, the racks and pump blocks shall not be considered in calculating the required parking spaces. 
4.  Uses not specified. Commercial parking requirements for uses not specified in this part shall be based upon a standard of one (1) space per two hundred fifty (250) square feet of gross floor area, unless the director of planning and community development or planning commission approve a different parking requirement, based on the most comparable uses specified in this part. 
5.  Shared parking. For the purposes of this section, "shopping center" shall mean a group of architecturally unified commercial and retail establishments built on a site which is planned, developed, and managed as an operating unit. 
For shopping centers containing at least 25,000 and up to 50,000 square feet of total building area, where office spaces exceed ten (10) percent of the total gross floor area, that portion in excess of ten (10) percent of the gross floor area shall be calculated at one (1) parking space per three hundred (300) square feet. 
Where cinema spaces exceed ten (10) percent of the total gross floor area, that portion in excess of ten (10) percent of the gross floor area shall be calculated at one (1) parking space per one hundred (100) square feet. 
Where restaurant, café, or other food and beverage service uses exceed ten (10) percent of the total gross floor area, that portion in excess of ten (10) percent of the total gross floor area shall be calculated at one (1) parking space per one hundred (100) square feet. 
For shopping centers containing 50,000 square feet or more of total building area, a shared parking reduction shall be allowed for the shopping centers based on the following:

A.  For any new retail developments, any exterior remodel of existing retail developments that includes changes to the parking lot, or any other parking lot remodel at existing retail developments, the fifty (50) percent tree canopy coverage requirement of subsection 9654.5.C.1 may be reduced by up to twenty (20) percent provided that the parking area, including driveways, are enhanced with pedestrian amenities with an equivalent square foot coverage area to offset the reduction of tree canopy coverage. The request for reduction in the fifty (50) percent tree canopy coverage requirement in subsection 9654.5.C.1 shall be reviewed by the planning commission. 
(a)  The pedestrian amenities shall include: 
i.  Shade structures such as carports, trellises, and arbors; 
ii.  Other amenities such as decorative paving and walkways in the parking lot, raised landscape planter seats, benches, fountains, art pieces, and other pedestrian amenities of similar intent approved by the city. 
(b)  Calculation of the coverage: 
i.  Shade structures defined in subsection 9654.C.2.A.(a).i.: The total square footage of shade structures shall apply toward equivalent tree canopy coverage. 
ii.  Other amenities defined in subsection 9654.5.C.2.A.(a).ii: One-half (1/2) of the square footage of coverage of other amenities shall apply toward equivalent tree canopy coverage.

(a)  Because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of subsections 9654.5.C.1 and 9654.5.C.2 deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and other retail developments. 
(b)  The granting of the in-lieu fee payment request will not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and other retail developments. 
(c)  The strict interpretation and enforcement of subsections 9654.5.C.1 and 9656.5.C.2 of the zoning ordinance would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the objectives of this article; and 
(d)  The granting of the in-lieu fee payment request will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to the subject property or adjacent properties.

3.  That the location and design of the proposed sign, its size, shape, illumination, and color are compatible with the visual characteristics of the surrounding area so as not to cause significant depreciation of the value or quality of adjacent properties. Depreciation shall be based on an independent property appraisal; 
4.  That the proposed sign is consistent with the sign standards found in subsection E. and F. below; 
5.  That the proposed sign is consistent with the adopted sign design guidelines available at the planning and community development public counter. 
E.  Sign standards.

5.  Illumination of signs. Unless otherwise prohibited by this part, signs may be illuminated subject to the approval of the director to ensure that such illumination does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties or create any public safety hazards. The approval of any illuminated sign shall not be final until thirty (30) days after installation during which period the director may order the dimming of any illumination found to be excessively brilliant, and no sign approval shall be valid until such order has been carried out to the satisfaction of the director. Illumination shall be considered excessive when it prevents perception of objects or buildings beyond or in the vicinity of the sign. In no case shall an illuminated sign or lighting device be so placed or directed as to permit the beams and/or illumination there from to be directed or beamed upon a public street, walkway, or adjacent properties so as to cause glare or reflection that may constitute a traffic or safety hazard or interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. 
6.  Screening. To minimize the visual mass and projection of the sign, all electrical transformer boxes and raceways shall be concealed from public view. If a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall, the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway shall be finished to match the background wall, or integrated into the overall design of the sign.

iv.  Materials and lighting. The use of plastic material as a background is not permitted. The sign background material shall be opaque, which means that any interior light source shall not penetrate the material and illuminate the background but shall be limited to illuminating the sign letters. 
v.  Landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided at the base of the supporting structure equal to twice the area of one (1) face of the sign. The director may reduce or waive this requirement if it is determined that the additional landscaping would not contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic character of the project. 
3.  Awning and canopy signs. Awning and canopy signs may be allowed only as an integral part of the awning or canopy to which they are attached or applied, as follows.

9655.6. - Sign program. 
A.  Purpose. A sign program is intended to (1) integrate the design of the signs proposed for a development project with the design of the structures, into a unified architectural statement; and (2) provide a means for defining common sign regulations for multi-tenant projects and other users of multiple signs, in order to encourage maximum incentive and latitude in the design and display of multiple signs, and to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this chapter. For the purposes of this provision, a development project is a project involving the construction or remodeling of improvements on privately-owned property. 
B.  Applicability. The approval of a sign program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exist, or whenever an applicant applying for a land use entitlement requests the approval of a sign program: 
1.  New multi-tenant developments of three (3) or more separate tenants that share either the same parcel or structure and use common access and parking facilities. 
2.  New multi-family developments whenever five (5) or more signs are proposed. 
3.  Whenever five (5) or more signs are proposed for a new or existing development; 
4.  When an existing shopping center requests an increase in the size, height, location and number of a monument or directory sign pursuant to subsection 9655.11 D. 
5.  The director determines that a sign program is needed to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Review and approval authority. The planning commission may approve a sign program through the granting of a sign permit for a sign program. 
D.  Application requirements. A sign permit application for a sign program shall include all information and materials listed in section 9655.5 and the filing fee set by the city's fee resolution. 
E.  Standards. A sign program shall comply with the criteria established in subsection 9655.5 D. and the following standards: 
1.  The program shall comply with the purpose of this chapter and the overall intent of this section; 
2.  The program shall accommodate future revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants; and 
3.  The program shall comply with the standards of this chapter, except that a variance or modification is allowed with regard to sign area, number, location, or height to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this division. 
F.  Revisions to sign programs. Revisions to a sign program determined to be minor in nature may be approved by the director with a standard sign permit if the intent of the original approval is not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of a new comprehensive sign program approved by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 05-330, § 1, 5-11-2005; Ord. No. 06-340, § 1, 12-13-2006) 
9655.7. - General provisions. 
A.  Sign area. The maximum allowable sign area shall be determined by drawing a line around the outer perimeter of the writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such sign from the background against which it is placed. If the sign consists of more than one (1) section or module, all of the area, including the area between the sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of sign area. Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area. Only one (1) face of a double-faced sign with parallel opposing faces, and bearing identical copy shall be used in computing the area of a sign. 
B.  Sign height. The maximum allowable sign height shall be measured by the distance from the average adjacent ground level within five (5) feet of the base of the sign to the top of the sign, including the superstructure and any design element. 
C.  Sign lighting. No sign shall be illuminated after 11:30 p.m. or close of business, whichever occurs last. 
D.  Owner's consent required. The consent of the property owner or person in control or possession of the property is required before any sign may be erected on any private property in the city. 
E.  Obstruction of public passage. No signs shall be installed so as to obstruct any window, door, fire escape or other emergency exit of any building. 
F.  Maintenance of signs. All signs shall be maintained in a neat and attractive, well-repaired condition. The display surface of all signs shall be kept clean, neatly painted and free from rust, cracking, peeling, corrosion or other states of disrepair. 
G.  Prohibited locations. No signs shall be located in such a manner as to face in the direction of or be visible to property in a residential district when such sign would be less than two hundred (200) feet from such residential property unless such sign faces and is parallel to a public right-of-way. 
H.  Noncommercial signs. Noncommercial signs are allowed wherever commercial signage is permitted and are subject to the same standards and total maximum allowances per site or building of each sign type specified in this chapter. An approval is required for a permanent noncommercial sign only when a permanent commercial sign has not been previously approved. For purposes of this division, all noncommercial speech messages shall be deemed to be "on-site", regardless of location. 
I.  Substitution of noncommercial message. Subject to the consent of the property owner or person in control or possession of the property, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for all or part of the commercial or noncommercial message on any sign allowed pursuant to this chapter. Design criteria that may apply to commercial signs, such as color, lettering style or compatibility with other signs on the same parcel or other signs subject to a sign program, do not apply to noncommercial signs. No special or additional approval is required to substitute a noncommercial message for any other message on an allowable sign, provided the sign structure is already approved or exempt from the approval requirement. When a noncommercial message is substituted for any other message, the sign is still subject to the same locational and structural regulations, such as size, height, illumination, maintenance, duration of display, building and electrical code requirements, as would apply if the sign were used to display a commercial message or some other noncommercial message. In the event of any perceived or actual conflict between the general provisions of this subsection and other specific provisions in this chapter, the provisions of this subsection shall prevail. 
J.  Substitution of commercial messages. The substitution of one (1) commercial message for another commercial message is not automatically allowed nor is the free substitution of a commercial message in a place where only a noncommercial message is allowed. In addition, no off-site commercial messages may be substituted for on-site commercial messages. 
(Ord. No. 05-330, § 1, 5-11-2005; Ord. No. 06-340, § 1, 12-13-2006) 
9655.8. - Sign entitlement by land use.

Such sign entitlements may be reduced as a condition of approval for the sign permit for a particular sign or signs if necessary to satisfy the sign criteria set forth in subsection 9655.5 D of this part. The purpose of sign regulations in the residential, commercial, business and office land use zones is to limit the number of signs to eliminate clutter and to promote compatibility, proportion, simplicity and sign effectiveness. 
A.  Residential land use districts. 
1.  Apartments and condominiums. One (1) monument identification sign may be erected on each public street frontage upon which the complex has public access. In addition, interior directional signs which are visible from any public right-of-way, may be approved by the director to identify special elements of such complexes such as clubhouses and other common area facilities provided that such signs do not exceed six (6) square feet in area and four (4) feet in height.

Office buildings shall be limited to one (1) business sign solely identifying the name of the building. For retail tenants located in a complex or center, the maximum sign length shall not exceed sixty-five (65) percent of the length of the tenant space in order to provide clear definition between signs and avoid a crowded appearance. The sign shall be generally centered over the store front or tenant space.

The total aggregate area of a sign for each business or any office building located more than one hundred (100) feet from any public or private right-of-way shall not exceed one (1) square foot of sign area for each foot of primary building frontage. For retail tenants located in a multi-tenant building, the sign area shall be calculated using one (1) square foot of sign area for each foot of frontage of the tenant space. In no event, however, shall the aggregate sign area exceed seventy (70) square feet. 
Office buildings shall be limited to one (1) business sign solely identifying the name of the building. For retail tenants located in a complex or center, the maximum sign length shall not exceed sixty-five (65) percent of the length of the tenant space in order to provide clear definition between signs and avoid a crowded appearance.

e.  Single tenant building or office building. For a single business totally occupying a commercial building, which is not part of a larger complex, project, center or park or for an office building, a freestanding monument sign is permitted. 
In addition to the basic sign entitlement, wall, canopy, awning and directional signs are allowed as follows: 
f.  Signs on awnings. Painted, nonilluminated signs may be permitted on the borders of marquees, canopies, awnings, arcades, or similar structures or attachments. Such signs shall be included in the basic sign area entitlements.

Pursuant to division 6 (section 9676 through 9676.7), the planning commission may approve minor modifications to the regulations relating to the size, height, number, and location of new or existing signs after a public hearing in those cases where an applicant is faced with exceptional circumstances related to the type or location of its business, or is trying to achieve a special design effect. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that: 
1.  The sign is or will not be detrimental to surrounding uses or properties or the community in general; and 
2.  The approval of such modification is consistent with the purposes of the general plan and this part, the sign criteria set forth in subsection 9655.5.D and the adopted sign design guidelines. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the size or height entitlement of a sign shall not be increased by more than thirty (30) percent.

In the case of an unsafe sign removed by the city, the costs of such removal and storage shall be borne by the permit holder, property owner, or person in possession and control of the property, as applicable and may be collected by the city in the same manner as it collects any other debt or obligation. No unsafe sign, which has been removed and stored by the city, shall be released until the costs of removal and storage have been paid. If an unsafe sign remains unclaimed for a period of thirty (30) days after notice of removal is sent to the permit holder, property owners, or person in possession and control of the property, it shall be deemed to be unclaimed personal property and disposed of in accordance with the law. 
F.  Removal of illegal signs on public property. The director shall remove or cause to be removed any temporary sign unlawfully placed or located on public property. The director shall notify the owner of such sign, if such owner is known, that its sign is being held at city hall and that it will be destroyed if not claimed by the owner within ten (10) days after the date of such notice. In the event that the owner does not claim such sign within said ten-day period, the director may destroy or otherwise dispose of such sign.

(Ord. No. 05-330, § 1, 5-11-2005) 
9655.12. - Nonconforming signs. 
    This section recognizes that the eventual elimination of existing signs (on site and off site) that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as important as the prohibition of new signs that would violate these regulations. 
A.  Continuation of nonconforming sign. A legally established sign that does not conform to the provisions of this chapter may continue to be used, except that the sign shall not be: 
1.  Structurally altered to extend its useful life;

C.  Correction of nonconformities required. Approval of any structures on a site or a change in the land use on a site shall require that all nonconforming signs on the site be brought into conformity with this chapter. 
D.  Within sixty (60) days after the discontinuance of a business in any commercial or industrial zone or before a new business occupies the premises, whichever comes first, all nonconforming signs and support structures shall be removed and the wording or advertising relating to the discontinued business shall be removed from all conforming signs. This section shall not be applicable to the assignment, lease or sublease of an existing business, which continues to conduct the same business on the same premises.

The city clerk shall expeditiously schedule a hearing before the city council and notify the appellant, in writing, of the day, time and location of the hearing, which shall be held not later than thirty (30) days after the notice of appeal is received by the city; provided, however, the hearing may be held after such thirty-day period upon the request or concurrence of the appellant. The time for compliance of any original order shall be stayed during the pendency of the hearing before the city council. 
B.  The city council shall provide the appellant with a written decision within ten (10) working days of the conclusion of the hearing. In the event any such sign approval, denial or revocation, or remediation or removal order is upheld by the city council, the approval, denial, revocation or order shall be effective on the date of the action by the city council, and that action shall be final and conclusive.

DIVISION 7. - OAK TREE PRESERVATION GUIDELINES 

9657. - Oak tree preservation regulations; purpose. 
    The city lies in the County of Los Angeles in the Conejo Valley, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced by the presence of large numbers of majestic oak trees. At one time, the area was almost completely covered by an oak forest; however, development of the city has resulted in the removal of a great number of these trees. Further, uncontrolled and indiscriminate destruction of oak trees would detrimentally affect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Agoura Hills. 
    The purpose of these sections is to protect and preserve oak trees in recognition of their historical, aesthetic and environmental value to the citizens of Agoura Hills, present and future, and to provide regulatory measures designed to accomplish this purpose. 
    The following sections set forth the policy of the city to require the preservation of all healthy oak trees unless compelling reasons justify the removal, cutting, pruning and/or encroachment into the protected zone of an oak tree. Such sections are subject to all other applicable ordinances, and the oak tree preservation guidelines adopted by the city council [and set out in Appendix A to this article]. 
9657.1. - Oak tree preservation. 
    No person, partnership, firm, corporation, government agency, or other legal entity shall cut, prune, remove, relocate, endanger or damage any tree protected by this section on any public or private land located within the incorporated areas of the City of Agoura Hills except in accordance with the conditions of a valid oak tree permit issued by the department of planning and community development or the planning commission pursuant to the provisions of section 9657 through 9657.5. 
9657.2. - Oak tree policy. 
    It shall be the policy of the City of Agoura Hills to require the preservation of all healthy oak trees unless compelling reasons justify the removal of such trees. This policy shall apply to the removal, pruning, cutting and/or the encroachment into the protected zone of oak trees. The department of planning and community development shall have the primary and overall responsibility to administer, evaluate and monitor this policy. 
9657.3. - Nonliability of city. 
    Nothing in these sections shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the City of Agoura Hills or upon any of its officers or employees, or agents, nor to relieve the owner and occupant of any private property from the duty to keep oak trees upon such property or under his control, in a safe condition. 
9657.4. - Exemptions. 
    The provisions of section 9657.1 shall not apply to the following: 
A.  Emergencies. In cases of emergencies, including but not limited to, thunderstorms, windstorms, floods or other natural disasters, or potential safety hazards, the requirements of section 9657.1 may be waived as follows: If upon a visual inspection, an oak tree is determined to be in a hazardous or dangerous condition, any member of law enforcement or a law enforcement agency or the Los Angeles County fire department may order or allow the removal of a protected tree. Prior notice to the department of planning and community development shall be provided, if possible. Subsequent to the emergency action, written notification shall be provided to the department of planning and community development describing the action taken and the nature of the emergency. 
B.  Routine maintenance as defined in the oak tree preservation guidelines. 
C.  Oak trees planted, grown and/or held for sale by licensed nurseries or the removal or transplanting of same pursuant to, and as a part of, the operation of a licensed nursery business. This exemption is limited to trees with main trunks under ten (10) inches in diameter. 
D.  When removal is determined necessary by fire department personnel actively engaged in fighting a fire. 
9657.5. - Oak tree permit. 
    Except as otherwise provided in section 9657.4, no person shall cut, prune, remove, endanger or encroach into the protected zone or relocate any oak tree on any public or private property within the city unless a valid oak tree permit has been issued from the director of planning and community development or the planning commission pursuant to the provisions of these sections and the oak tree preservation guidelines, by filing the proper form and paying the appropriate fee. The accuracy of all required information submitted shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
A.  Administrative approvals. The department of planning and community development has jurisdiction to approve a request for the removal of one (1) oak tree on a single parcel. Except for dead trees, subsequent requests for the removal of trees beyond the number of one (1) on a single parcel of record will be referred to the planning commission for review and approval. 
B.  Planning commission approval. When two (2) or more trees are being requested for removal on an original application, the case will be referred to the planning commission. 
C.  Oak tree permit approval process. The director of planning and community development or the planning commission may approve an oak tree permit when one (1) of the following findings can be made, after city inspection of the tree and property. 
1.  The condition or location of the protected trees requires cutting or pruning to maintain or remedy its health, balance or structure. 
2.  The condition of the tree(s) with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing structures, high pedestrian traffic areas such as parking lots, pedestrian walkways or interference with utility services cannot be controlled or remedied through reasonable preservation and/or preventive procedures and practices. 
3.  It is necessary to remove, relocate, prune, cut or encroach into the protected zone of an oak tree when, after a determination by the planning commission or director, it is found that the continued existence totally prevents the development of the subject property. An oak tree permit shall not be granted pursuant to this subparagraph 3 unless all the following additional findings are made: 
a.  That the proposed construction or proposed use will be accomplished without endangering the health of the remaining trees on the subject property; 
b.  That the removal or relocation of the oak tree(s) proposed will not result in soil erosion through the diversion or increased flow of surface waters which cannot be satisfactorily mitigated; 
c.  That the removal or relocation of the oak tree(s) proposed is necessary because the continued existence at present location(s) prevents the planned improvement or proposed use of the subject property to such an extent that alternative development plans cannot achieve the same permitted density or that the cost of such alternative would be prohibitive; or that the placement of such tree(s) precludes the reasonable and efficient use of such property for a use otherwise authorized; or that the oak tree(s) proposed for removal or relocation interferes with utility services or streets and highways, either within or outside of the subject property, and no reasonable alternative to such interference exists other than removal of the tree(s). 
If the applicant has met the above criteria, an oak tree permit may be issued subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  Not more than ten (10) percent of the total estimated tree canopy or root structure of all trees on the subject property has been requested to be removed. 
(b)  In certain exceptional cases, the removal of up to twenty (20) percent of the total tree's canopy or root system may be removed. However, such approval is predicated upon the recommendation of the city's oak tree preservation consultant stating that the viability of the oak tree will not be adversely affected. 
(c)  In no case shall less than four (4) native oaks be provided for any oak tree removed or relocated. 
D.  Conditions on removal. Conditions may be imposed on the permit at the discretion of the decisionmaker, including but not limited to, any of the following: 
1.  A condition requiring the replacement or placement of additional trees on the subject property to offset the impacts associated with the loss of a tree or its limbs or encroachment into the protected zone of an oak tree; 
2.  The relocating of trees on-site or off-site, or the planting of a new tree off-site to offset the loss of a tree; 
3.  A condition requiring an objectively observable maintenance and care program to be initiated to insure the continued health and care of oak tree(s) on the property; 
4.  Payment of a fee or donation of a potted tree to the city or other public agency to be used elsewhere in the city should a suitable replacement location for a tree not be possible on-site or off-site. 
E.  Oak tree report. The director shall cause, at the applicant's expense, the preparation of an oak tree report by a city-approved oak tree consultant. 
F.  Oak tree preservation guidelines. In granting an oak tree permit, the director of planning and community development or the planning commission shall require the permit to comply with provisions of the adopted "Oak Tree Preservation Guidelines" and may impose such conditions necessary to carry out the intent of this article and said guidelines. However, in no case shall less than four (4) native oaks be provided for any oak tree removed or relocated. 
G.  Notice of permit decision. Upon completion of the processing of an oak tree permit, the director of planning and community development or the planning commission may approve, conditionally approve or deny the application for an oak tree permit and notice of such decision shall be mailed to the applicant, city council, and planning commission. 
H.  Appeals. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the notice of decision, the applicant, city council, or planning commission may appeal the decision of the director of planning and community development to the planning commission or the decision of the planning commission to the city council. 
I.  Enforcement. 
1.  Additional remedies. Any person who cuts, damages, moves, or removes any oak tree within the city or encroaches into the drip line of an oak tree in violation of this chapter shall be subject to the following remedies in addition to any penalties provided by the Municipal Code: 
(a)  A suspension of any building permits until all mitigation measures specified by the city are satisfactorily completed. 
(b)  Completion of all mitigation measures as established by the city. 
2.  Restitution. It has been determined that the oak trees within the city are valuable assets to the citizens of this community and to the citizens of the County of Los Angeles and as a result of the loss or damage to any of these trees, the public should be recompensed. 
Any person violating the provisions this chapter shall be responsible for proper restitution and may be required to replace the oak tree(s) so removed or damaged, by the donation of or by replanting two (2) or more oak trees of reasonable equivalent size and value to the tree damaged or removed. The number, size and location of said equivalent replacement oak trees shall be determined by the director of planning and community development.

9658.3. - Landscape standards. 
    Proposed plant materials shall relate to architectural design elements of the structures on the site and shall be compatible with the character of adjacent landscaping, provided the quality of the adjacent landscaping meets the standards set forth in this section. The following landscape standards for permanent landscaping are minimum requirements. 
A.  Minimum site coverage. Landscape percentages shall be computed on the basis of the net project site area which includes the area of all structures, drives, walks, and parking on the site, but not areas dedicated for public right-of-way. The required percentages of landscaping relative to site area are set forth in the provisions relating to each land use district. 
B.  Minimum planter width. Landscaped areas shall be a minimum of four (4) feet wide (including curbs). 
C.  Perimeter planting. The area within required setbacks of commercial or business projects, not used for other permitted purposes, shall be landscaped. 
D.  Parking areas. The landscape requirements for parking lots are set forth in the provisions relating to off-street parking. 
E.  Screening. Landscaping should be used to screen storage areas, trash enclosures, parking areas, public utilities, and other similar land uses or elements which do not contribute to the aesthetic enhancement of the surrounding areas. Landscape screening shall be of a height and density so that it provides the desired effect within five (5) years growing time. 
F.  Street trees. Street trees may be required as a condition of any permit granted or issued under this article. No street tree will be approved for planting where its growth will cause interference, obstruction, damage, or injury (either directly or indirectly) to the use of a sidewalk or street right-of-way. Street trees shall be planted according to the following standards: 
1.  Trees shall not be planted within thirty (30) feet of the curb return of a street intersection. 
2.  Trees shall not be planted closer than four (4) feet from any public walkway or public sidewalk, except where tree wells or parkways are provided in the sidewalk area. 
3.  Trees shall not be located closer than ten (10) feet from any driveway, utility pole, fire plug or to the rear of any street or directional sign; fifteen (15) feet from light standards, and twenty-five (25) feet from the front of any traffic or directional sign. 
4.  Trees shall be spaced an average of forty (40) feet apart, but not less than one (1) per lot and two (2) per corner lots. 
5.  Trees that typically grow taller than twenty (20) feet in height shall not be encouraged under utility wires. 
9658.4. - Use of plant materials. 
    The scope of a project will ultimately determine landscape plant selection. In order for landscaping to relate to architectural design, the following criteria shall apply: 
A.  Evergreen trees are encouraged against buildings to soften the appearance of bland expanses of walls, and to visually screen neighboring projects and subdivided exterior spaces. 
B.  Deciduous trees are effectively used for solar control in summer and winter. Some such trees are flowering and are desirable as accents. 
C.  Large shrubs are effectively used to screen undesirable views and act as an intermediate height element to bring buildings into human scale. 
D.  Medium/low shrubs are ornamental and provide foliage, texture and color to landscape themes. 
E.  Vines and espalier are effective screens in visually softening walls and fences. Many vines provide excellent flower color to brighten narrow planters against buildings and walls. 
F.  Applicable native plant materials and drought tolerant species are encouraged for water conservation. 
9658.5. - Ground cover. 
    Irrigated and nonirrigated ground covers shall be as follows: 
A.  Irrigated ground cover . Low growing spreading shrubs that are drought tolerant are the preferred choice of ground cover planting. 
B.  Nonirrigated ground cover. In certain situations, temporary plantings may be required where irrigation is not economically feasible nor desirable. Nonirrigated hydromulch seeds are acceptable for natural or undisturbed slopes. Hydromulch seeds should be applied following the first measurable rainfall in the fall of the year or a temporary irrigation method shall be provided to ensure germination and minimum growth. If the natural rainfall fails to provide adequate moisture for germination, supplemental irrigation may be required. 
(Ord. No. 15-420, § 4, 11-10-2015) 
9658.6. - Water efficient landscaping. 
    The city adopts by reference the California State Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance, and any amendments thereto, as the law of the city. One (1) copy of the California State Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance is filed in the office of the planning department, and the ordinance is adopted by reference as if incorporated and set out in this chapter. The requirements of this chapter shall apply in addition to the applicable requirements of the California Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance. 
    Landscape and irrigation plans subject to the California State Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance shall conform to the requirements of the California State Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance to achieve water efficient landscaping. In the event of a conflict between the California State Model Efficient Landscape Ordinance and another provision of this division, the provision that contains the more stringent water efficiency requirement(s), as determined by the planning director, shall control. 
    For those sites where the installation of reclaimed water systems is feasible and meets all regulatory requirements, recycled water irrigation systems (dual distribution systems) shall be installed to allow for the current and future use of reclaimed water and shall be designed and operated in accordance with local and state codes. 
    All public and private properties shall prevent water waste resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation by minimizing runoff, low head drainage, overspray or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows or drifts onto adjacent property, nonirrigated areas, walks, roadways or structures.

3.  Only applicants who have been granted the right to enter the public right-of-way pursuant to state or federal law, or who have entered into a franchise agreement with the city permitting them to use the public right-of-way, shall be eligible for a permit to install or modify a wireless telecommunications facility or a wireless telecommunications collocation facility in the public right-of-way. 
B.  Design and development standards. All wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless collocation telecommunications facilities that are located within the public right-of-way shall be designed and maintained as to minimize visual, noise and other impacts on the surrounding community and shall be planned, designed, located, and erected in accordance with the following: 
1.  General guidelines. 
a.  The applicant shall employ screening and camouflage design techniques in the design and placement of wireless telecommunications facilities and wireless telecommunication collocation facilities in order to ensure that the facility is as visually inconspicuous as possible, to prevent the facility from dominating the surrounding area and to hide the facility from predominant views from surrounding properties all in a manner that achieves compatibility with the community. 
b.  Screening shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with surrounding structures using appropriate techniques to camouflage, disguise, and/or blend into the environment, including landscaping, color, and other techniques to minimize the facility's visual impact as well as be compatible with the architectural character of the surrounding buildings or structures in terms of color, size, proportion, style, and quality. 
2.  Traffic safety. All facilities shall be designed and located in such a manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety. 
3.  Blending methods. All facilities shall have subdued colors and nonreflective materials that blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures. 
4.  Antenna mounts. The applicant shall use the least visible antennas possible to accomplish the coverage objectives. Antenna elements shall be flush mounted, to the extent feasible. All antenna mounts shall be designed so as not to preclude possible future collocation by the same or other operators or carriers. Unless otherwise provided in this section, antennas shall be situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their function. 
5.  Poles. 
a.  Only pole-mounted antennas shall be permitted in the right-of-way. All other telecommunications towers are prohibited, and no new poles are permitted that are not replacing an existing pole. 
b.  No facility shall be located on a pole that is less than twenty-five (25) feet in height. 
c.  Utility poles. The maximum height of any antenna shall not exceed twenty-four (24) inches above the height of an existing utility pole, nor shall any portion of the antenna or equipment mounted on a pole be less than eighteen (18) feet above any drivable road surface. All installations on utility poles shall fully comply with the California Public Utilities Commission general orders, including, but not limited to, General Order 95, as revised. 
d.  Light poles. The maximum height of any antenna shall not exceed six (6) feet above the existing height of a light pole. Any portion of the antenna or equipment mounted on a pole shall be no less than eighteen (18) feet above any drivable road surface. 
e.  Replacement poles. If an applicant proposes to replace a pole in order to accommodate the facility, the pole shall match the appearance of the original pole to the extent feasible. If the replacement pole exceeds the height of the existing pole, the antenna(s) shall not extend above the top of the replacement pole for more than "X" feet, where "X" is calculated by subtracting the difference in height between the original and replacement poles from six (6) feet. 
f.  Pole mounted equipment shall not exceed six (6) cubic feet in dimension. 
g.  All poles shall be designed to be the minimum functional height and width required to support the proposed antenna installation and meet Federal Communications Commission requirements. Poles and antennas and similar structures shall be no greater in diameter or other cross-sectional dimensions than is necessary for the proper functioning of the facility. The applicant shall provide documentation satisfactory to the director establishing compliance with this paragraph. 
h.  If an exception is granted for placement of new poles in the right-of-way, new poles shall be designed to resemble existing poles in the right-of-way near that location, including size, height, color, materials and style, with the exception of any existing pole designs that are scheduled to be removed and not replaced. Such new poles that are not replacement poles shall be located at least ninety (90) feet from any existing pole, to the extent feasible, to prevent pole clustering in the public right-of-way. 
i.  All cables, including, but not limited to, electrical and utility cables, shall be run within the interior of the pole and shall be camouflaged or hidden to the fullest extent feasible without jeopardizing the physical integrity of the pole. 
6.  Each facility shall be designed to occupy the least amount of space in the right-of-way that is technically feasible. 
7.  Each facility shall be properly engineered to withstand high wind loads. An evaluation of high wind load capacity shall include the impact of modification of an existing facility. 
8.  Each component part of a facility shall be located so as not to cause any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, inconvenience to the public's use of the right-of-way, or safety hazards to pedestrians and motorists and in compliance with section 9661.14.

10.  In no case shall any ground-mounted facility, above-ground accessory equipment, or walls, fences, landscaping or other screening methods be less than eighteen (18) inches from the front of curb. 
11.  All cables, including, but not limited to, electrical and utility cables, between the pole and any accessory equipment shall be placed underground. 
12.  Each facility shall be built in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
13.  Accessory equipment. With the exception of the electric meter, which shall be pole-mounted to the extent feasible, all accessory equipment shall be located underground. 
a.  Unless city staff determines that there is no room in the public right-of-way for undergrounding or that undergrounding is not feasible, an exception shall be required in order to place accessory equipment above ground. 
b.  When above ground is the only feasible location for a particular type of accessory equipment and cannot be pole-mounted, such accessory equipment shall be enclosed within a structure, and shall not exceed a height of five (5) feet and a total footprint of fifteen (15) square feet, and shall be fully screened and/or camouflaged, including the use of landscaping, architectural treatment, or acceptable alternate screening. Required electrical meter cabinets shall be adequately screened and/or camouflaged. 
14.  Landscaping. Where appropriate, each facility shall be installed so as to maintain and enhance existing landscaping on the site, including trees, foliage and shrubs, whether or not utilized for screening. Additional landscaping shall be planted, irrigated and maintained by applicant where such vegetation is deemed necessary by the city to provide screening or to block the line of sight between facilities and adjacent uses. 
15.  Signage. No facility shall bear any signs or advertising devices other than certification, warning or other signage required by law or permitted by the city. 
16.  Lighting. No facility may be illuminated unless specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other government agency.

Written notice of the removal shall be served upon the person who owns the facility within five (5) business days of removal and all property removed shall be preserved for the owner's pick-up as feasible. If the owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the property within sixty (60) days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned property.

In addition to the procedures for recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect such costs from the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with this Code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no obligation to store such facility. Neither the permittee, owner nor operator shall have any claim if the city destroys any such facility not timely removed by the permittee, owner or operator after notice, or removed by the city due to exigent circumstances.

Variances/modifications should be done by separate action, but can be processed concurrently with the conditional use permit. 
E.  Findings. The planning commission shall make the following findings before granting a conditional use permit:

Such request shall be considered by the planning commission after a public hearing. 
9673.3. - Modification of conditional use. 
    Section 9673.2 of this chapter shall apply to an application for modification, expansion, or other change in a conditional use; provided, that minor revisions or modifications may be approved by the director if he determines that the changes would not affect the findings prescribed in section 9673.2, and the application for revision or modification is filed within one (1) year from the date the original conditional use permit becomes final, does not change the use designated in the original conditional use permit, does not increase, reduce, or alter the size or shape of the premises to which the original conditional use permit pertained, and does not extend the time in which the actual establishment of the conditional use permit or the commencement of construction under the conditional use permit shall take place.

    Application for a conditional use permit may be made at the same time as application for a change in zone boundaries including the same property, in which case the planning commission shall hold the public hearing on the zoning classification and the use permit at the same meeting and may combine the two (2) hearings. For the purposes of this section, the commission decision on the jointly filed applications shall be a recommendation to the city council. The city council shall be the final decisionmaker on the jointly filed applications and shall consider such conditional use permit in accordance with these provisions. 
9673.7. - Adult businesses; additional findings prerequisite to permit. 
    In addition to the findings required pursuant to section 9673.2E.4 and 6, the commission shall approve an application for a conditional use permit for an adult business where the information submitted by the applicant and/or presented at the public hearing substantiates the following findings:

When an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval donates land to the city that satisfies the requirements of Government Code § 65915(h), and complies with all procedural requirements of that subsection, including recordation of a deed restriction, then the maximum allowable residential density for the site shall be multiplied by fifteen (15) percent. However, for each one (1) percent increase above the minimum percentage of land required to be donated pursuant to Government Code § 65915(h), the density bonus shall be increased by one (1) percent up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent. This increase shall be in addition to any increase required by subsection A., up to a maximum combined density increase of thirty-five (35) percent if an applicant seeks both the increase required by this subsection and by subsection A. 
    All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The density bonus shall not be included when determining the number of target units. When calculating the required number of target units, any resulting fraction of units shall be rounded to the next whole number.

1.  The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, or for rents for the targeted units. 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
B.  Number of incentives or concessions. In addition to the density bonus granted per subsection 9674.3 B., the applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or concessions: 
1.

b.  Sources and use of funds statement identifying the projected financing gap of the project with the affordable housing units that are the basis for granting the density bonus and incentive(s) or concession(s). The developer shall establish how much of the gap would be covered by the density bonus, leaving a remainder figure to be covered by an additional incentive. 
c.  An appraisal report indicating the value of the density bonus and of the incentive(s) or concession(s) and of the value of any other incentive. 
    Determination of the completeness and accuracy of the financial information submitted in support of a request for an incentive and evaluation of this information shall be made by the city.

The agreement shall be binding upon all future owners and successors in interest for this property, which is the subject of the housing development application. 
C.  Findings. All of the following findings shall be made, as applicable, in order to approve a density bonus, and incentive(s) or concession(s). 
1.  That the density bonus will contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of providing the affordable housing units. 
2.  That the incentive or concession is required in order to make the affordable housing units economically feasible or to set rents at qualifying levels for senior citizens and for moderate income, lower income or very low income households. 
3.  That the increased density and incentive(s) or concessions(s) will not cause significant adverse effects on the public health and safety or the physical environment.

B.  Where doubt exists as to the location of a district boundary in the interior of a block, the boundary shall be the nearest interior lot line existing at the effective date of this article or at the date when the property may have been subsequently rezoned. 
C.  In subdivided property, the district boundary lines on said map shall be determined by use of the scale on the map unless dimensions are shown thereon by figures. 
D.  Where the street layout on the ground or the lot lines differ from such layout or lines on the zoning map, the matter shall be referred to the planning commission to determine the exact boundary, and the map shall be amended to conform to the layout on the ground. 
9807.3. - Language. 
    Where used in this article the word "shall" is always mandatory and not discretionary or directory. The word "may" is permissive. The present tense includes the past and future tenses, and the future tense includes the present. The masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter. The singular number includes the plural, and the plural the singular.

9808.2. - Issuance of building permit. 
    The building official shall not issue a building permit until the zoning administrator has approved a use certificate for the structure which is the subject of the building permit. 
9808.3. - Issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
    The building official shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for a structure or alteration until he has found that the structure or alteration conforms with the use certificate, until all required screening and landscaping and off-street parking and loading facilities are complete, and all conditions attached to a use permit, variance, or site plan review have been met; provided, that the building official may issue a certificate of occupancy prior to the fulfillment of all requirements of this article if a faithful performance bond in an amount determined by the building official to be sufficient to complete the work necessary to meet the requirements is filed with the city. Cash in the amount of the faithful performance bond may be deposited with the city in lieu of the bond. 
9808.4. - Temporary certificate. 
    A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the building official prior to the time that all of the requirements for a certificate of occupancy have been met; provided, that no permit other than a temporary permit shall be issued for gas or electric utilities until the building official determines that all of the requirements for a certificate of occupancy have been met.

If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the city will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. 
C.  Other discretionary permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, the applicant shall file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval.

(Ord. No. 11-393, § 4, 1-11-2012)

3.  The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city. 
4.  The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's land use and zoning program. 
5.  The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
B.  In determining whether the requested reasonable accommodation is necessary to provide one (1) or more disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, pursuant to subsection 9809.5.A.2., the city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one (1) or more individuals with a disability. 
2.  Whether the individual(s) with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation. 
3.  Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants. 
4.  Whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in the city. 
C.  In determining whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's land use and zoning program, pursuant to subsection 9809.5.A.4., the city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood. 
2.  Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking. 
3.  Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an applicable specific plan or other similar regulatory document. 
4.  Whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation. 
D.  Rules while decision is pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect.

9809.8. - Expiration and discontinuance. 
A.  Expiration. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this division shall expire within twenty-four (24) months from the effective date of approval, or at an alternative time specified as a condition of the approval, unless: 
1.  A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced; or 
2.  A certificate of occupancy has been issued; or 
3.  The right granted by the accommodation has been exercised; or 
4.  A time extension has been granted by the director or planning commission, whichever has authority over the granting of the reasonable accommodation. 
B.  Discontinuance. If the disabled person for whom the reasonable accommodation was originally granted vacates the residence, or if the director finds that the accommodation is no longer necessary for the use and enjoyment of the residence pursuant to subsection 9809.5.A., the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the director determines that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the municipal code, or (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The director may request that the applicant, or his or her successor-in-interest, provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within thirty (30) days of the date of a request by the city shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of a previously approved reasonable accommodation. 
(Ord. No. 11-393, § 4, 1-11-2012) 
9809.9. - Amendments. 
    A request for changes in the conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval, shall be treated as a new application. The director may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve substantial alterations or additions to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval.

Appendix A - OAK TREE PRESERVATION GUIDELINES[23] 

Footnotes: 
--- (23) --- 
Editor's note- At the request of the city, Appendix A, Oak Tree Preservation Guidelines, has been set out at length herein. It should be noted however, that Attachment I, oak tree care and maintenance has been omitted from publication until the updated revision thereof is available. Words enclosed in brackets [ ] have been added by the editor for clarity. 

I. - Purpose. 
    The city lies in the County of Los Angeles in the Conejo Valley, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced by the presence of large numbers of majestic oak trees. At one time, the area was almost completely covered by an oak forest, however, development of the city has resulted in the removal of a great number of these trees. Further, uncontrolled and indiscriminate destruction of oak trees would detrimentally affect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Agoura Hills. 
    The purpose of these sections is to protect and preserve oak trees in recognition of their historical, aesthetic and environmental value to the citizens of Agoura Hills, present and future, and to provide regulatory measures designed to accomplish this purpose. 
    No person, partnership, firm, corporation, government agency, or other legal entity shall cut, prune, remove, relocate, endanger or damage any tree protected by this section [appendix] on any public or private land located within the incorporated areas of the City of Agoura Hills except in accordance with the conditions of a valid oak tree permit issued by the department of planning and community development or the planning commission pursuant to the provisions of sections 9657 through 9657.5 of the city zoning ordinance. 
    It shall be the policy of the City of Agoura Hills to require the preservation of all oak trees unless compelling reasons justify the removal of such trees. This policy shall apply to the removal, pruning, cutting and/or the encroachment into the protected zone of oak trees. The department of planning and community development shall have the primary and overall responsibility to administer, evaluate and monitor this policy. 
Cross reference- Similar provisions set out in §§ 9657-9657.2. 
II. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this resolution [appendix], unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this resolution [appendix] are defined in this section. 
A.  Certification letter.

B.  Compensatory pruning. That certain amount of pruning necessary to be performed to reinstate the proper rootleaf equilibrium. 
C.  Cutting. The detaching or separating, either partial or whole, from a protected tree, any part of the tree including, but not limited to, leaves, limb, branch or root. Cutting shall include pruning. 
D.  Dead tree. A tree that does not contain any live tissue; i.e., green leaves or live limbs. Since valley oaks (Quercus Lobata) are deciduous trees and are dormant in the winter, their status must be confirmed by the city's oak tree consultant before being declared dead. 
E.  Deadwood. Limbs or branches that contain no green leaves or live limbs. 
F.  Deadwooding. The process of trimming an oak tree of its deadwood. 
G.  Dripline. An imaginary line drawn upon the ground at the furthest extension of the canopy around the circumference of the tree. 
H.  Encroachment. Any intrusion into the protected zone of an oak tree; i.e., pruning, grading, excavating, trenching, etc. (Refer to definition of "Protected Zone" in section II.R.) 
I.  Fine grading permit. An entitlement from the city authorizing certain grading work that must be conducted within the protected zone of an oak tree, and allows proper drainage to occur as required by the Agoura Hills Municipal Code. 
J.  Ground plane improvements. Improvements that do not significantly disturb the soil within the protected zone of an oak tree. 
K.  Oak tree. Any oak tree of the Genus Quercus including, but not limited to, Valley Oak (Quercus Lobata), California Live Oak (Quercus Agrafolia) and Scrub Oak (Quercus Dumosa) regardless of size. The definition of oak tree shall include "protected tree".

Q.  Pre-application conference. A meeting between the developer and appropriate city representatives for the purpose of discussing the requirements for submitting an application for an oak tree permit. 
R.  Pre-construction conference. A meeting with the developer, contractors, superintendent, engineers, oak tree consultants, and city representative [to] delineate special procedures, limits of work, lines of authority and special conditions or procedures not specifically covered by any ordinance. 
S.  Protected tree. Shall mean the same as oak tree (see definition of "oak tree" in section II.K.). 
T.  Protected zone. Using the dripline as a point of reference, the protected zone shall commence at a point five (5) feet outside of the dripline and extend inwards to the trunk of the tree. In no case shall the protected zone be less than fifteen (15) feet from the trunk of an oak tree. 
[Note- See the illustration following these definitions.]

III. - Oak tree permit-Processing procedures. 
    Any person desiring to remove, cut branches (except for removing deadwood), and/or pursue any activity which has the potential to damage a protected oak tree must first obtain an oak tree permit from the department of planning and community development. Actions which have the potential to damage a tree include, but are not limited to, trenching, excavating or paving within the protected zone of a tree or at least fifteen (15) feet from the trunk, whichever distance is greater. The processing of applications for oak tree permits will employ the procedures outlined below. These steps have been developed to ensure efficient and consistent handling of permit requests. Some of the actions which have the potential to damage a tree include, but are not limited to, grading and/or grubbing, trenching, excavation, pruning, and paving. 
[1.]  Step One: Pre-application conference. The purpose of this meeting is to familiarize the applicant with the city's permit process, to identify the information and materials necessary to file an application for an oak tree permit, and to discuss applicable policies and procedures relative to the project. A pre-application conference may be arranged by calling the department of planning and community development. 
[2.]  Step Two: Formal application. Once the applicant has completed all application forms and prepared all of the information identified during the pre-application conference, the applicant may formally submit the project application. 
Fees: 
1.  New construction. The following fees will be charged in conjunction with the application. 
1.1. Staff Review-As established by council resolution. 
1.2. Planning Commission Review-As established by council resolution. 
2.  Existing construction. The following fees apply equally to commercial and residential properties. 
2.1. Dead or hazardous oak trees (removals)-A flat fee, as established by council resolution, per tree will be charged. However, the fee shall be waived or refunded, if upon staff inspection, the tree is declared dead or hazardous. If, after staff inspection, it is determined that the services of the city's oak tree consultant are required to make a final determination, the fee shall be retained by the city to cover costs of said services. 
[3.]  Step Three: Application review. On receipt of an application for an oak tree permit, the department of planning and community development shall review the application for accuracy and completeness and make an inspection of the project site. 
In those situations requiring expert review, the application will be reviewed by the city's oak tree consultant. Those situations requiring consultant review include, but are not limited to, projects involving significant numbers of protected trees, projects involving development activities in the immediate vicinity of protected trees, and/or projects where physical protective measures may be required for the continued health of the remaining trees. 
Upon completion of application review and on-site inspections, the city's oak tree consultant shall submit a written report to the department of planning and community [development] outlining the findings and recommendations. Normally, this will occur within ten (10) working days of receipt of the application materials from the city. 
[4.]  Step Four: Findings for approval. After receiving all of the required information, the request may be approved when one of the following findings can be made. 
1.  The condition of the protected tree(s) requires cutting to preserve its health or maintain its balance. 
2.  The condition of the protected tree(s) general health with respect to the perceived danger of falling over or dropping limbs and its proximity to: existing structures, high pedestrian areas such as roadways, pedestrian walkways, parking lots or interference with public utility lines cannot be controlled or remedied through reasonable preservation and/or preventive measures. 
3.  The approval of this request will not be contrary to or in conflict with the general purpose and intent of the oak tree ordinance. 
4.  In evaluating requests for removal or encroachments based on the reasonable and conforming use section, the city shall take into consideration: comparison of proposed building(s) gross floor area and other on-site design features with other conforming developments in the same vicinity and zone, and any other factors that are unique to the property such as topographic constraints and other physical limitations. The applicant shall be responsible for submitting adequate information to demonstrate that reasonable and conforming use cannot be made of the subject property without removal(s) or encroachment(s) into the protected zone of an oak tree. 
[5.]  Step Five: Appeals. Pursuant to section 9657.5.H of the oak tree preservation regulations under the city's zoning ordinance, the decision of the director of planning and community development may be appealed to the planning commission upon filing of the proper form and payment of appropriate fees. The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council and any decision by the city council shall become final and effective upon its adoption. 
IV. - Oak tree permit-Application requirements. 
    The materials required to complete an application are described below. The department of planning and community development may waive the filing of one (1) or more of the items listed when deemed unnecessary to process the application. However, additional information may be required when determined necessary for permit processing. 
    The accuracy of all information, maps and lists submitted shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
A.  Permit required. There shall be no removal of or encroachment into the protected zone of an oak tree larger than two (2) inches in diameter when measured at a point three and five-tenths (3.5) feet above the tree's natural grade without first obtaining an oak tree permit. 
B.  Application form. Application shall be made on the standard application form supplied by the department of planning and community development and is included in this packet [appendix] as Attachment "A". The signature of the property owner will be required in all cases. 
C.  Justification statement. An application requirement, which may not be waived, is a written statement by the applicant or its oak tree preservation consultant stating the justification for planned actions involving oak trees. 
Statements should establish how the oak trees in the vicinity of the project or construction site will be protected; that any construction or use will be done with approved preservation methods; and that one of the following findings can be made: 
1.  That due to the condition of the protected tree(s), certain actions are required to maintain its health, balance or structure. 
2.  That the retention or failure to allow some encroachment of the trees as described in the application prohibits the reasonable and conforming use of the property. (Refer to section 9657.5 for specific guidelines.) 
3.  That the condition of the tree(s) subject to this ordinance with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed buildings and/or structures, parking lots or interference with utility services cannot be controlled or remedied through redesign of the site elements, reasonable preservation procedures and practices. 
D.  Site plan map. The requirement for a site plan map may be waived in some situations involving cutting or removal of dead or hazardous oak trees. 
In those cases determined to require a site plan map, the following information should be included. (A sample Site Plan Map is included in Attachment "B".) 
NOTE: Existing site plan may be used provided the information is both current and accurate. 
1.  Size: Maps should not exceed 30" × 42" in size. 
2.  Scale: The scale should not be smaller than 1" = 20'. 
NOTE: Map size and scale may be decreased with prior approval. 
3.  Title block: In one corner of the map, indicate the name of the property owners, applicant, appropriate consultants, (such as surveyor and oak tree specialists) address(es) and phone number(s) of those involved in preparing the plans and application. 
4.  Physical characteristics: The body of the map should accurately portray the following existing and proposed features: 
4.1.  Property lines; 
4.2.  Streets, access easements and/or public or private driveways and any other paved areas; 
4.3.  Buildings or structures; 
4.4.  Setbacks of all buildings and structures from property lines; 
4.5.  Parking and other paved areas; 
4.6.  Land uses on parcel (existing and proposed as applicable); 
4.7.  Proposed grading and construction; including utilities and subdrains, if available. 
5.  Oak tree locations: Unless advised differently, the map shall indicate the exact location of an oak tree proposed to be encroached upon, removed and/or relocated, and those oaks within 250 feet of the project or construction area. Surveying the exact location(s) of the tree(s) both horizontally and vertically is very important and must be accomplished by obtaining the services of a professional engineer or a licensed land surveyor whose signature shall be affixed to the site plan and oak tree location map as appropriate. 
6.  Dripline(s) of the tree(s): The exact location of the dripline of an oak tree is crucial in order to evaluate any impacts resulting from construction. Consequently, aerial photographs and rough approximations will not be acceptable. The dripline must be plotted in the following manner: 
a.  Obtain and record eight (8) compass readings; N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. 
b.  Perform a measurement of the dripline in the field at each compass reading. 
c.  Sketch in any variations as observed in the field. 
In certain cases, it may be possible to physically stake the surveyed corners of building(s) or related improvements in the field in order to assess the potential impacts upon the trees. The determination for these requirements will be made during the pre-application conference. 
In anticipation of a field inspection, each tree shall be assigned a number on the plan and physically tagged in the field as described in section IV.E. of this resolution [appendix]. 
E.  Tagging. In the process of preparing oak tree reports each tree is required to be numbered. In order to standardize the system so that everyone may easily locate the tree number the following procedure is hereby established: 
1.  A permanent tag, a minimum of one and one-quarter (11/4) inches to two (2) inches is to be used for this purpose. The tag must be made from a noncorrosive, all-weather material and be permanently attached to the tree. 
2.  The tag shall be affixed to the north side of the tree at a height of three and one-half (31/2) feet above the natural elevation. 
3.  Except for trees whose number has become obliterated, trees that were previously tagged need not be retagged. 
4.  Trees whose numbers have become obliterated shall be retagged using the new method described in subsections 1. and 2. above. 
F.  Oak tree report. 
1.  General. 
a. No Report Necessary: The determination on the requirement for an oak tree report will be made during the pre-application conference and will be predicated on the scope of the project and the nature of its impact on the surrounding trees. In general, the requirements for an oak tree report may be waived only in situations involving the removal of dead or hazardous trees, subject to verification by the city's oak tree consultant. 
b. New Report Necessary: In situations requiring the submission of an oak tree report, the document shall be certified by the applicant's oak tree consultant to be true and correct and must be acceptable to the director of planning and community development. Questions concerning the extent of the report's content or the acceptability of the report's preparer should be cleared with the planning staff in advance. 
c. Use of Existing Report: In cases where there is an existing oak tree report on a project that was not approved and/or constructed, the developer may be required to provide a supplementary report rather than a new report. In addition to any design changes, the report will retain the original numbering system and include the current health of each oak tree on the project. 
2.  Criteria. The oak tree report shall describe and evaluate the health and condition of the subject oak trees with respect to such factors as the existence of disease and danger of the tree falling. Additionally, each tree shall be rated on a scale of A to F. (The rating system is described in subsection F.3.) 
A tree evaluation form shall be completed for each affected tree showing the location, spread, trunk diameter (as measured three (3) feet, six (6) inches above the average ground level at the base of the tree) and species name of each oak tree. (Sample tree evaluation forms are included in Attachments "C" and "D".) Additionally, the report shall discuss all grading, required cutting, paving or trenching in and around the trees on the project and shall evaluate, to the extent possible, the impact of such activity on the tree as well as any mitigating measures proposed, and the anticipated effectiveness thereof. 
In addition, the oak tree report shall contain the following information: 
2.1. Physical Evaluation. The physical evaluation of each tree includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
(a)  Location of the tree-Accomplished by a professional engineer or a licensed land surveyor; for individual lots, consultants may accurately plot the actual tree location utilizing property line hubs; 
(b)  Diameter of trunk at three (3) feet, six (6) inches above grade; 
(c)  Diameter of canopy and accurate plotting of the protected zone and mean natural grade at base; 
(d)  Height of tree; 
(e)  Appearance rating on a "A-F" scale based on standard tree of same species ("A" would be a nearly symmetrical, healthy tree, "F" would be a dead tree); 
(f)  Existing tree environment including type of terrain; 
(g)  Physical structure-Excessive horizontal branching unbalanced crown, broken branches, etc.; and any mitigation measures proposed to correct any problems; 
(h)  The minimum clearance from the present grade to the bottom of the canopy on each of the compass points. 
2.2. Horticultural Evaluation. Horticultural evaluation information required; including but not limited to: 
(a)  Physical evidence of disease, exfoliation, leaf scorch, exudations; etc. It is required that each identified disease symptom be accompanied with a statement as to the probable effect of the disease upon the life or structure of the tree. 
(b)  Identification of pests, twig girdler-borers, termites, pit scale, plant parasites; etc. 
(c)  Evaluation of tree's vigor-Example: new tip growth, good leaf color, poor leaf color, abnormal bark, deadwood, thinning of crown; and recommended mitigation measures necessary to correct any problems. 
(A sample oak tree report is included in Attachments "E" and "F".) 
3.  Oak tree rating system. In rating oak trees, the following system will be used to describe their condition. 
3.1.  "A" = Outstanding: A healthy and vigorous tree characteristic of its species and reasonably free of any visible signs of disease or pest infestation. 
3.2.  "B" = Above average: A healthy and vigorous tree with minor visible signs of disease and/or pest infestation. 
3.3.  "C" = Average: Although healthy in overall appearance there is an abnormal amount of stress or disease and/or pest infestation. 
3.4.  "D" = Below average/poor: This tree is characterized by exhibiting a greater degree of disease and/or pest infestation than normal and appears to be in a state of rapid decline. The degree of decline may vary greatly in signs of dieback, disease and pest infestation and appears to be in an advanced state of decline. 
3.5.  "F" = Dead: This tree exhibits no signs of life whatsoever. 
V. - Standards for performance of required work. 
A.  General information: 
1.  Scope of work. All work shall be performed as specified in the approved oak tree report, oak tree permit and the requirements contained in this resolution and the accompanying standards and details. Additional work such as spraying, watering, fertilization, cabling, bracing, etc., may be required as determined by the city's oak tree consultant. It must be remembered that these trees are living organisms and that the necessity for such additional work may be required due to a change in their condition since the original oak tree report was prepared. 
2.  Oak tree preservation consultants. Generally, the services of an oak tree consultant are made necessary by conditions of various permits issued by the City of Agoura Hills. The importance of the consultant to the developer/property owner is clear from the various requirements listed in this resolution. From the city's perspective it is both necessary and critical that the developer/property owner identify the consultant(s) of record and allow them to act independently to perform their duties in a manner whereby they will be able to certify work as required by this resolution. Consequently, except in cases where major cuts have been approved, the developer/land owner must not fail to provide their consultant(s) with a forty-eight-hour advance written notice before commencing any authorized work within the protected zone of oak trees. Moreover, it is mandatory that the developer/land owner notify the department of planning and community development in writing within five (5) days of any changes of their oak tree preservation consultant(s) of record. 
3.  Inspections. All work shall be conducted in accordance with applicable ordinances and procedures detailed in this resolution. It is the developer's responsibility to call for and secure all inspections required to approve all such work. 
4.  Work within the protected zone. Because of the high sensitivity of oak trees, great care must be taken when work is being conducted within the protected zone. For this reason, the city has established specific procedures to ensure that the trees receive maximum protection. The procedures are as follows: 
4.1.  Forty-eight-hour notice. Except for deadwooding, the applicant shall provide a forty-eight-hour written notice to the department of planning and community development and his oak tree consultant before beginning any work within the protected zone. 
4.2.  On-site supervision. Except for deadwooding, all work conducted within the protected zone of the oak tree shall be performed in the presence of the applicant's oak tree consultant, and verified by the city's oak tree consultant. 
4.3.  Hand tools. Unless otherwise approved, all work conducted within the protected zone shall be accomplished using hand tools only. 
4.4.  Certification letter. Certification letters are required for all work conducted upon oak trees. In this regard, the developer's oak tree consultant shall submit a certification letter to the department of planning and community development within five (5) working days of completion of such work certifying that all of the work was conducted in accordance with the appropriate permits and the requirements of this resolution. 
5.  New plants within the protected zone. Although any planting within the protected zone is discouraged, only drought tolerant plantings will be permitted. Moreover, if such plants are allowed, no spray-type irrigation systems will be permitted. 
Each request to plant within the protected zone of an oak tree will be judged on its own merits. Paramount in the consideration of a request will be the compatibility of the plantings to the intent to preserve the oak. Plants should be selected from those normally found beneath an oak tree in its natural setting. Use caution to avoid plants which are susceptible to either Phytophthora cinnamomi (Avacado root rot) or Armillaria mella (oak root fungus). 
B.  Tree maintenance and pruning operations: 
1.  Ornamental or aesthetic pruning. It is the policy of the City of Agoura Hills not to allow the removal of live tissue for the purpose of altering the appearance of an oak tree. Therefore, ornamental pruning, thinning out, heading up, or any other similar pruning which involves the removal of live tissue is not permitted. 
2.  Deadwooding. Generally speaking, deadwooding an oak tree is self-explanatory in that no live tissue is allowed to be removed. 
3.  Structurally unsafe limbs and branches. Live limbs or branches that do not exceed three (3) inches in diameter and are considered to be unsafe because of decay, rot, cavities, cracks or splitting can be removed without obtaining an oak tree permit. However, the decision to remove such limbs must be made by the developer's oak tree consultant. Any remedial actions on limbs larger than three (3) inches in diameter will be subject to city approval. Such request shall include a brief report from the developer's oak tree consultant detailing the conditions that exist and any remedial work recommended to correct the situation. 
4.  Unbalanced trees. Trees that are suspected of being unbalanced because of broken limbs or which may become unbalanced as a result of the deadwooding process will require an oak tree report and an oak tree permit before any work can be performed. The report shall contain an analysis of the problem and a recommendation for whatever remedial work may be necessary to correct the situation. 
5.  Pruning live tissue (encroachments). Generally, the removal of live growth must be approved by the department of planning and community development through an oak tree permit application. A property owner may remove live tissue without obtaining an oak tree permit, only when 1: the branches do not exceed two (2) inches in diameter and 2: the branches interfere with an existing structure. No oak tree may be topped, even if cuts are limited to branches less than two (2) inches in diameter. In cases where new structures are proposed for construction, no branch, regardless of size, can be removed without obtaining an oak tree permit. No live tissue (roots or branches) exceeding two (2) inches in diameter can be removed without first obtaining an oak tree permit except where clearance is required for public utilities or public rights-of-way after notice to the city. 
For the purposes of this section, "topping" shall mean the cutting of the branches of a tree in a manner which will substantially reduce the overall size of the tree canopy so as to destroy its natural shape. 
All pruning work shall follow proper arboricultural practices as approved by the city's oak tree consultant. Where root damage has occurred, the developer's consultant may recommend compensatory pruning of the canopy to reinstate the proper root/leaf equilibrium. All diseased, dead or improperly pruned limbs shall be removed from each tree. All root cuts two (2) inches and larger in diameter must be sealed with an approved pruning compound. 
6.  Fire damaged trees. Although fire is considered a serious threat to oak trees, many trees can survive several damaging fires and live one hundred (100) to two hundred (200) years or more. During this time they can continue to provide wildlife enhancement, watershed protection, recreation and aesthetic value to the community. 
Some trees may begin to exhibit visible signs of rejuvenation within a few weeks of a fire. In its publication "Five Southern California Oaks: Identification and Post-fire Management: The USCDA General Technical Report (PSW-71)" states that, "It is desirable to postpone the cutting of heavily charred coast live oak trees for at least two (2) to three (3) years on the chance that most trees will recuperate. Since there are many factors that will determine the survival of fire damaged trees, a careful assessment of each individual tree must be undertaken before deciding on a specific course of action." 
Policy: Therefore, it shall be the policy of the City of Agoura Hills to require a complete oak tree report on any and all oak trees that have been fire-damaged before any work can be permitted. This policy also applies to deadwooding. 
In preparing this report, oak tree consultants may assess the extent of the damage using visual, chemical or electrical techniques as necessary. Recommendations to remove a tree or to perform remedial work may follow the general guidelines contained in the following publications. 
a.  U.S. Department of Agriculture, General Technical Report, PSW-71. 
b.  Response of Oaks to Fire; prepared by Tim R. Plumb and presented at the Symposium on Ecology, Management and Utilization of California Oaks, June 26-28, 1979. 
If the removal of any live tissue is so indicated, an exception may be made to prune the tree in such a manner so as to permit the regeneration process to proceed unhindered by dead or unhealthy limbs. When cases such as these occur, the developer's oak tree preservation consultant will recommend a program in the oak tree report to address the problem. 
7.  Diseased trees; pests and insects. Generally speaking, our native oak trees are a hardy species. However, there are a variety of diseases and pests that can severely affect trees that are in a state of general decline. Since the entire subject of diseases, pests and insects in a highly technical matter, no diseased tissue may be removed, unless it is unsafe, without submitting an oak tree report and obtaining an oak tree permit. 
8.  Roots. All roots one (1) inch or larger shall be treated as in subsection 5 (pruning). Where structural footings are required and roots will be impacted, the footings shall be bridged and the roots protected. Cover all such roots with a layer of plastic cloth and two (2) to four (4) inches of styrofoam matting prior to pouring the footing. (Standard details are shown in Exhibit E-1, 2 and 3). 
Finally, all trees that have suffered root damage shall be fed nutrients to encourage new growth. The developer's oak tree consultant shall make recommendations to the city before proceeding with a nutrient feeding program. 
9.  Cavities. All cavities must be cleaned out of loose debris. Some cavities must be cleaned out to remove all decayed wood while protecting live tissue from injury, provide food proper drainage and allow for new growth, as determined by the city's oak tree consultant. Concrete or other similar materials shall not be used to seal or fill cavities. Screening shall be applied over remaining cavities to prevent debris buildup. 
10.  Tree removals. Unless otherwise expressly approved in writing, authorized removal of oak trees shall be accomplished using the following guidelines: 
10.1.  All portions of the tree shall be completely removed from the site and debris relocated to a recognized county refuse disposal site. Additionally, the stump must be completely removed and the hole or indentation filled with soil. 
10.2.  All tree wells that were created to preserve the tree shall be completely filled with soil to the satisfaction of the city engineer and building official. 
10.3.  Replacement trees shall be planted in accordance with the procedures established in section V.5 of this resolution [appendix]. 
10.4.  Unless waived by the department of planning and community development, a refundable security deposit in an amount equal to the cost of the replacement trees shall be deposited in trust with the City of Agoura Hills to guarantee the implementation of section 10.3. The deposit will be refunded upon satisfactory completion of these conditions. 
10.5.  A signed acceptance of the conditions of the oak tree permit for removal shall be executed by the applicant or his representative and the refundable security deposit shall be made prior to the issuance of the oak tree permit. 
C.  Phases of construction: The information contained in this section is divided into the four (4) phases normally associated with new construction. Apart from the normal activities conducted during each phase, there are certain conditions associated with work around oak trees that are required to be completed during these phases. This section addresses these conditions and, unless waived by the department of planning and community development, are expected to be completed for all residential, commercial and industrial projects. 
1.  Pre-construction phase. This period is defined as the time between the approval of a development permit and the issuance of a stage grading or final grading permit. No work of any kind may occur on an approved project unless a state grading permit, grading permit or oak tree permit has been obtained from the City of Agoura Hills. A grading plan for parcels with oak trees on the property will not be approved until the oak tree consultant has reviewed and approved the grading plan. Generally speaking, the following activities will occur before the commencement of grading operations. 
1.1.  Pre-construction conference. During the conduct of this meeting representatives from the departments of planning and community development and engineering will address various issues relating to oak trees on the project site. These issues include, but shall not be limited to, the following matters: 
(a)  The fencing plan. The developer or his representative shall bring a copy of the fencing plan to the pre-construction meeting. Using the approved grading plan or the site plan map, the fencing plan should be designed along the following guidelines: 
(1) A minimum five-foot high new chain link fence in concrete footing will be required to be installed at the outermost edge of the protected zone of each oak tree or groups of trees. Exceptions to this policy may occur in cases where oak trees are located on slopes that will not be grubbed or graded, or are located on future phases where there is no activity planned or no currently approved grading plan. The fences must be installed in accordance with the approved fencing plan prior to the commencement of any grading operations. The developer's superintendent will be responsible to call the department of planning and community development for an inspection and approval of the fencing prior to the beginning of grubbing or grading operations. 
(2) Additionally, signs must be installed on the fence in four (4) locations (equi-distant) around each tree. The size of each sign must be a minimum of two (2) feet by two (2) feet square and must contain the following language: 
WARNING 
THIS FENCE SHALL NOT BE REMOVED OR RELOCATED WITHOUT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE CITY OF AGOURA HILLS DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. 
On a grove of oak trees, signs shall be placed at approximately fifty-foot intervals around the grove. 
(3) Once approval has been obtained, the fences shall remain in place throughout the entire construction period and may not be removed without obtaining written authorization from the department of planning and community development. 
(b)  See required tagging per section IV.E. of this resolution [appendix.] 
2.  Grading operations phase. This period is defined as the time between the commencement of grading operations and the commencement of construction of the building improvements. It is understood that the construction phase may begin while grading operations are continuing and that grading may begin on a subsequent phase while construction is still in progress on a previous phase. 
For purposes of this section, each phase is considered separate and the conditions associated with each phase will be required to be completed at the start or during the operations of each phase. The inspector from the department of planning and community development will make that determination in the field. 
In addition to the normal grading operations conducted during this phase, the developer will be required to complete or satisfy the following tasks: 
2.1. On-site documentation. The following information must be located and permanently retained on the construction site at the start of grading operations. The superintendent will be required to call the department of planning and community development to request an inspection and to verify that the information is located on site. 
(a)  Oak tree report-All present and proposed modifications. 
(b)  Oak tree location map. 
(c)  Oak tree fencing plan. 
(d)  Oak tree permit and all present and future modifications. 
(e)  Approved grading plans approved by the city engineer and oak tree consultant. 
Stamped set approved by the department of planning and community development. 
(f)  Permit and tract conditions: A copy of the approved permit and tract conditions, and all current and future modifications approved by the department of planning and community development. 
(g)  Oak tree inspection card. 
(h)  Oak tree ordinance. 
(i)  Oak tree preservation guidelines. 
(j)  Approved planting and irrigation drawings. 
2.2. Oak tree removals, deadwooding, pruning, pest control, feeding, fertilization. Unless otherwise approved, the applicant is required to complete oak tree removals, pest control, feeding, and fertilization, as approved by the oak tree permit for the entire project or the phase that is currently being graded. Deadwooding or pruning is to be accomplished during the construction phase of the project, unless otherwise approved. 
2.3. Retaining walls within the protected zone. In cases where an oak tree permit has been approved for the construction of retaining walls within the protected zone of the oak tree, the developer will be required to complete these improvements before completion of grading operations and before commencement of the construction phase. (Refer to Attachments G-1, 2 and 3 for standard details.) 
2.4. Oak tree preservation devices. If required by the oak tree report and the oak tree permit, preservation devices such as air ventilation systems, oak tree wells, drains, special paving and cabling systems will be required to be installed before the completion of the grading phase and the commencement of the construction phase. These devices must be installed under the direct supervision of the developer's oak tree consultant who will be responsible to write a letter certifying all such work and submit it to the department of planning and community development. 
2.5. Utility trenching-pathway plan. In order to avoid unnecessary damage to the root system, prior to the completion of the grading operations and before the commencement of the construction phase, the developer will be required to submit a utility trenching-pathway plan to the departments of planning and community development and the city engineer for review and approval. The plan will depict all of the following systems: storm drains, sub-drains, sewers, easements area drains, gas lines, electrical service, cable TV, water mains, irrigation mainlines, and any other underground installations. 
Additionally, the plan must show all lateral lines serving the residences. To be completely effective, the plan must include the surveyed locations of all oak trees on the project as well as an accurate plotting of the protected zone to within one (1) foot. 
The plan should be developed considering the following general guidelines: 
(a)  All systems in this subsection (2.5), shall avoid going into the protected zone of any oak tree. 
(b)  Where it is not possible to avoid some encroachment, the design shall minimize the extent of such encroachment and a report of these encroachments and mitigation measures will be made in a supplemental oak tree report. 
2.6.  Parking lots and pedestrian walkway improvement location. Since the city's policy is to preserve all healthy oak trees unless justifying the removal, cutting or relocation of an oak tree, architects should design their projects with this requirement in mind. Therefore, for public safety reasons, parking lots and pedestrian walkways must be designed so that no unhealthy oak trees are proposed to remain in high vehicular and pedestrian areas. Trees whose ratings are confirmed to be a "D" or less should be avoided in pre-design or proposed for removal unless it is felt that major surgery coupled with a nutrient feeding program will restore the tree to a safe and vigorous condition. 
To the extent possible, parking spaces should not be located directly under the canopy of oak trees. When this is not possible, pervious paving material shall be employed to the satisfaction of the Director of Planning and Community Development. The developer's licensed engineer will be required to certify that such work was accomplished under his personal supervision and in accordance with the approved plans. 
2.7.  Cut and fill slopes. In general, every effort should be made to avoid cut and/or fill slopes within the protected zone of any oak tree. Where fill slopes are proposed, the oak tree report must include a soils report indicating whether or not it will be necessary to cut and recompact the area prior to moving the fill material into position. 
3.  Construction phase. This period is defined as the time during which building improvements are under construction. 
3.1.  Ground plane improvements. The following improvements may be permitted to be installed within the protected zone of an oak tree subject to the approval of an oak tree permit issued by the department of planning and community development and the limitations and guidelines contained in this section: Patio covers, wood decks, garden walls, fences, gazebos and other similar improvements. The guidelines and limitations are as follows: 
(a)  An oak tree permit shall be submitted and approved by the department of planning and community development. 
(b)  Trenching under the dripline of an oak tree may be conducted with hand tools only. 
(c)  All of the work shall be conducted in the presence of an oak tree preservation consultant, subject to verification by the city's oak tree consultant. 
(d)  Minor roots under one (1) inch in diameter may be cut but must be treated with an approved compound before the improvements are installed. 
(e)  Roots over three (3) inches may only be cut with city approval and must be treated with an approved compound before the improvements are installed. 
(f)  All root pruning shall consist of clean cuts at a forty-five-degree angle with the cut surface facing downward. 
3.2.  Fine grading permit (oak tree lots only). On most tracts, the drainage patterns for the lots will have been designed into the original grading plan. However, this is not the case with custom lots and custom lot tracts. Therefore, in an effort to avoid establishing drainage patterns that intrude into the protected zone of oak trees, the following procedures have been established: 
(a)  Custom lots and custom lot tracts. A fine grading permit will need to be obtained from the city engineer before any fine grading work may begin. The landscape architect or engineer shall design a pattern that will completely avoid the protected zone utilizing surface and/or subsurface drainage devices. Additionally, the oak tree consultant will be required to submit a supplemental oak tree report to the department of planning and community development for review and approval prior to fine grading the lot. 
Following approval of the plan and the completion of the work, the oak tree consultant will submit a letter of certification to the department of planning and community development. 
(b)  Other lots and projects. On all other projects, grading plans will be designed at the outset to avoid the protected zone of the oak trees. The procedure for these lots will be as described in custom lots, above. 
4.  Post construction phase. This period is defined as the time following the completion of all building improvements. In residential zones, the construction phase and the post construction phase will overlap as houses are completed and new houses are still being constructed. For purposes of this section, certain conditions will be required to be completed before a zoning clearance (leading to a certificate of occupancy) can be issued by the department of planning and community development. 
4.1.  Certification of oak tree work. On all lots containing oak trees, the inspector from the Department of Planning and Community Development will require that all of the oak tree work required by the conditions of the development permit, the Oak Tree Report and the Oak Tree Permit, as applicable, have been completed and certified by the developer's oak tree preservation consultant prior to issuing a zoning clearance for release of occupancy. 
4.2.  Oak tree information packet. In cooperation with the sales agent, the developer will be required to provide and certify that an oak tree information packet, as approved by the director, has been provided to the buyer of the property and the homeowners' association. The information to be included in this packet is as follows: 
(a)  Oak trees-Care and maintenance; 
(b)  Oak tree ordinance; 
(c)  Oak tree preservation guidelines; 
(d)  Development permit: Copy of the city-approved conditions of the permit; 
(e)  Certification of receipt of the oak tree information packet will be accomplished as follows: 
Developer/sales agent shall prepare a letter introducing the packet. The letter and the packet shall then be sent by certified mail to the property owner. The developer shall forward a copy of the letter and a signed copy of the return receipt card to the department of planning and community development where it will be recorded and stored. 
C.1.  Oak tree planting and replacement program. In recognition of the fact that oak trees are a precious and diminishing resource, it shall be the policy of the City of Agoura Hills to replace or relocate oak trees in cases where removals have been approved in accordance with the following schedule: 
1.  Dead or hazardous oak trees. 
1.1.  Commercial and industrial properties. One (1) thirty-six-inch box oak tree shall be planted for each tree approved for removal. 
1.2.  Residential properties. One (1) thirty-six-inch box oak tree shall be planted for each tree approved for removal for new construction. However, in cases where houses currently exist on the property, the requirement for replacement shall be one (1) fifteen-gallon oak tree for each oak tree approved for removal. 
2.  Healthy oak trees. 
2.1.  Commercial properties. Whether for new or existing construction three (3) oak trees shall be planted to replace each tree that was approved for removal as follows: 
(a)  Two (2) twenty-four-inch box specimens, and 
(b)  One (1) thirty-six-or sixty-inch box specimen as follows: 
In the case of landmark trees, (trees whose diameter exceeds forty-eight (48) inches, the applicant will be required to obtain a nursery-grown oak tree of equivalent caliper to the tree removed or provide two (2) container grown, sixty-inch box oak trees for each healthy landmark tree approved for removal. The purpose of this limitation is to avoid the introduction of oak root fungus and Avaca root rot into this region. 
2.2.  Residential properties. The replacement policy for new construction in residential properties is the same as described above in 2.1. However, in cases where houses currently exist, the requirement for replacement shall be one (1) thirty-six-inch box oak tree for every healthy oak tree approved for removal. In cases of landmark trees (forty-eight inches or more in diameter) a sixty-inch box oak tree shall be required to be planted. 
3.  Relocations. In certain limited cases the city may consider the relocation of oak trees from one area in the project to another. The guidelines and limitations of this program are as follows: 
3.1.  Oak trees which are approved for relocation will be considered by the city as removals. 
3.2.  The tree(s) being recommended for relocation must be approved by the city's oak tree consultant whose decision will be based upon factors relating to health, type, size, time of year and proposed location. 
3.3.  The diameter of any relocated tree may not exceed six (6) inches in diameter. Exceptions to this policy may be made if a larger diameter nursery grown oak tree is available and can be reserved for a period of one (1) year in the event the relocated tree does not survive for one (1) year. 
3.4.  A refundable cash security deposit, in an amount equal to the cost of purchasing an equivalent nursery grown oak tree, shall be made with the department of planning and community development. The deposit will be refunded after twelve (12) months if, in the opinion of the city's oak tree consultant, the relocated tree has survived and is considered to be in good health. If the tree is considered to be marginal, the deposit will be retained for an additional twelve (12) months, when another inspection will be conducted. If the health of the tree is unchanged or has declined, the developer will remove the relocated tree and replace it with an equivalent nursery grown oak tree. The security deposit shall be retained for at least an additional twelve (12) months. 
3.5.  Trees of replaceable size may be considered for removal so that the new nursery tree can be planted on site in a more appropriate location relative to the new construction. 
4.  Replacement tree-Types, sizes. 
4.1.  Types. In all cases, replacement trees will be as follows: Quercus Agrifolia (Live Oak), Quercus Lobata (Valley Oak). Other oak tree varieties must be approved in advance by the city's oak tree consultant. 
Note: In some cases, where it is not possible to obtain nursery grown trees in the sizes required, an equivalent number of large and small container oak trees shall be planted in an amount equal to the cost of the larger but unavailable trees. 
4.2.  Sizes. While it is recognized that tree sizes may vary somewhat, the following table taken from the Keeline-Wilcox 1985 wholesale catalog will serve as the basis for what the city expects in terms of sizes. Consultants will be expected to make every attempt to obtain oak trees whose specifications most nearly approach the following: 
    _______ 
Size Container Height (Feet) Spread (Feet) Caliper (Inches) 15 Gal. 24" Box 8 to 10 5 to 6 2 to 21/2 30" Box 10 to 12 6 to 8 21/2 to 3 36" Box 12 to 14 8 to 10 3 to 31/2 42" Box 14 to 16 10 to 12 31/2 to 4 48" Box 16 to 18 12 to 13 4 to 41/2 54" Box 18+ 13 to 14 41/2 to 5 60" Box 20+ 14 to 15 5 to 6 72" Box 22+ 15+ 6+ _______  
5.  Location of replacement trees. In determining the location of replacement trees, the director of planning and community development shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
5.1.  The vegetative character of the surrounding area near the project site; and 
5.2.  The number of oak trees subject to this ordinance [appendix] which are proposed to be removed in relation to the number of such trees currently existing on the project site; and 
5.3.  The anticipated effectiveness of the replacement oak trees as determined by the oak tree report submitted by the applicant; and 
5.4.  The development plans submitted by the applicant for the proposed construction or the proposed use of the project site. 
In cases where conditions preclude the project site for planting the replacement trees, the director of planning and community development may consider other options as follows: 
5.5.  Planting oak trees on public property such as designated open space areas, public parks, etc. 
(Ord. No. 232, § 1, 7-14-93) 
VI. - Enforcement. 
A.  General. The department of planning and community development through its code enforcement officers shall vigorously enforce the provisions of the oak tree ordinance and the oak tree preservation guidelines contained within this resolution [appendix]. Additionally, inspectors from building and safety and engineering, in the course of their regular duties, will monitor activities on-site on a daily basis. Any irregularities or suspected violations will be immediately reported to the code enforcement section for followup action. 
B.  Stop work orders. Whenever any construction or work is being performed contrary to the provisions of the oak tree ordinance, oak tree preservation guidelines, oak tree permit or conditions of the appropriate development permit, a city inspector may issue a written notice to the responsible party to stop work on the project on which the violation has occurred or upon which the danger exists. The notice shall state the nature of the violation or danger and no work shall be allowed until the violation has been rectified and approved by the code enforcement officer or the city's oak tree consultant. 
C.  Citations. 
1.  Additional remedies. Any person who cuts, damages, moves, or removes any oak tree within the city or encroaches into the drip line of an oak tree in violation of section 9657.5 of the city's zoning ordinance shall be subject to the following remedies in addition to any penalties provided by the Municipal Code: 
(a)  A suspension of any building permits until all mitigation measures specified by the city are satisfactorily completed. 
(b)  Completion of all mitigation measures as established by the city. 
2.  Restitution. It has been determined that the oak trees within the city are valuable assets to the citizens of this community and to the citizens of the County of Los Angeles and as a result of the loss or damage to any of these trees, the public should be recompensed. 
Any person violating the provisions of this chapter [appendix] shall be responsible for proper restitution and may be required to replace the oak tree(s) so removed or damaged, by the donation of or by replanting two (2) or more oak trees of reasonable equivalent size and value to the tree damaged or removed. The number, size and location of said equivalent replacement oak trees shall be determined by the director of planning and community development. 
The value shall be established as provided in the tree evaluation formula, as prepared by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers.

10703. - Application. 
(a)  Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act or this title requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a subdivision, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by Chapter 4.5 of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code and this chapter, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
(Ord. No. 125, 6-2-87; Ord. No. 168, § 2, 2-14-90) 
10704. - Filing and processing. 
    A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form, have the same contents, and provide the same information and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this title for a tentative map, except as hereinafter provided: 
(a)  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face, the words "Vesting Tentative Map." 
(b)  The application for a vesting tentative map shall describe the manner in which the subdivision is proposed to be developed, including but not limited to the height, size and location of all buildings and other improvements.

(Ord. No. 125, 6-2-87) 
10707. - Expiration. 
    The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period and shall be subject to the same extensions established by this title for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map.

10708. - Vested rights created by approval of vesting tentative map. 
(a)  Subject to the time limits established by paragraph (c) of this section, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. If Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, however, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved, subject to the time limits established by paragraph (c) of this section. 
(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied, even though such action may be contrary to the ordinances, policies, and standards described in paragraphs (a), if any of the following are determined: 
(1)  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision, or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both. 
(2)  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
(c)  The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in section 10707 of this chapter. If the final map is timely approved, such rights shall exist for the following periods of time: 
(1)  An initial time period of one (1) year after the recording of the final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. 
(2)  The initial time period set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) above, shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is filed. 
(3)  The subdivider may apply to the planning commission for a one-year extension at any time before the expiration of the initial time period set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of this section. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the city council within fifteen (15) days thereafter. 
(4)  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subparagraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3), above, the rights referred to herein shall continue to exist until the expiration of such permit, or any extension thereof. 
(Ord. No. 125, 6-2-87) 
10709. - Amendment to vesting tentative map. 
    Any time prior to the expiration of a vesting tentative map, the subdivider, or his or her assignee, may apply for an amendment to such map. A public hearing shall be held by the planning commission on any amendment involving a substantial modification to the subject subdivision or development related thereto. The planning commission may approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the proposed amendment. The decision by the planning commission on the requested amendment shall be appealable to the city council in the manner provided by Section 10416 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 125, 6-2-87)

    Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner, or his or her designee, may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in section 10708(a), and the city may grant such approvals or issue such permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law and are supported by substantial findings. 
(Ord. No. 125, 6-2-87) 
10711. - Subsequent permits, licenses, and other entitlements for use. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to prevent the city from conditionally approving or denying any permit, license, or other entitlement for use which is applied for by the subdivider after the approval of a vesting tentative map, provided such conditional approval or denial is made in accordance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in section 10708(a) of this chapter.

CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE 
This table allows a user of this Code to locate the section, or in some instances, subsections of the Code affected by a particular ordinance. The user of the Code should note that a three-part number in parentheses refers to a section of the Los Angeles County Code, adopted by reference and amended. See the entry for Ord. No. 37 for an example. Building code amendments are similarly noted; see the entry for Ord. No. 31 for an example of that. None of the ordinances that affect zoning are currently listed; upon inclusion of that ordinance in the Code, entries will be added to this table.
