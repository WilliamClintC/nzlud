(d)    If the fine in any administrative citation is not paid within the time prescribed in this section, a late penalty may be charged in an amount to be established by separate resolution of the City Council.

(e)    Any fine for an administrative citation paid in accordance with this section shall be refunded if, after an administrative hearing, it is determined that the person charged with the administrative citation was not responsible for the violation; or that there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation; or if the City Manager cancels the citation. Payment of a fine under this chapter shall not excuse or discharge any continuation or repeated occurrence of any violation that is the subject of the administrative citation; payment shall not bar further enforcement action by the City if the violation reoccurs or continues to exist.

(f)    The abatement of a continuing violation shall be verified by an enforcement officer. The responsible person shall schedule an inspection by an enforcement officer to verify the abatement. The scheduling of an inspection shall toll the accruing fines until a determination is made.

(c)    The request for hearing form shall contain the following information:

(2)    A brief statement in ordinary and concise language of the specific item that is contested, together with any supporting facts; and

(3)    A brief statement in ordinary and concise language of the relief sought and the reason why the administrative citation should be rescinded, modified, or otherwise set aside.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)

(c)    The City Manager may waive the requirement of an advance deposit and issue the advance deposit hardship waiver only if the responsible person has submitted a sworn affidavit, together with any supporting documents or materials that demonstrate proof of enrollment in a State of California public assistance program, such as Medi-Cal, to the satisfaction of the City Manager.

(d)    The City Manager shall issue a written determination to issue or not issue the advance deposit hardship waiver. The written determination shall be final and shall be served by regular mail upon the person who applied for the advance deposit hardship waiver.

(e)    If the advance deposit hardship waiver is not issued, an advance deposit of the fine specified in the administrative citation shall be remitted to the City within ten (10) days of the date of the City Manager’s determination, or thirty (30) days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is later. If the deposit is not paid within this time, the responsible person shall be deemed to have failed to timely appeal the administrative citation.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.09 Administrative Hearing Procedure.

(a)    A hearing to contest an administrative citation before a hearing officer shall be granted only if: (1) a request for hearing form has been completed and returned to the City Clerk in compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and (2) the fine has been deposited or an advance deposit hardship waiver obtained.

(b)    The hearing officer may only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the violation occurred and whether the responsible person caused and/or maintained the violation.

(c)    At least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, the responsible person shall be provided with copies of any and all citations, reports, and other documents to be submitted by the enforcement officer to the hearing officer; failure to satisfy this requirement shall cause that evidence to be inadmissible.

(d)    At least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, the enforcement officer shall be provided with copies of any and all documents to be submitted by the responsible person to the hearing officer; failure to satisfy this requirement shall cause that evidence to be inadmissible.

(e)    The formal rules of evidence shall not apply to the administrative hearing. All relevant evidence may be considered, and the hearing officer has the discretion to exclude evidence that the hearing officer finds to be irrelevant or redundant.

(f)    The administrative citation and any additional documents submitted by the enforcement officer shall constitute prime facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents.

(g)    The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall be given the opportunity to: (1) testify and present witnesses; (2) introduce relevant evidence; (3) cross-examine and/or rebut any witness testifying in support of the administrative citation; and (4) be represented by anyone designed by the responsible party.

(h)    The City shall be given the opportunity to: (1) present witnesses; (2) introduce relevant evidence; (3) cross-examine and/or rebut any witness testifying in opposition to the administrative citation.

(i)    The City shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the code exists.

(j)    Unless requested in advance by the person contesting the administrative citation, neither the enforcement officer nor any other representative of the City is required to attend the hearing; provided, that any such appearance may be made at the discretion of the enforcement officer or the City Manager.

(k)    The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional information from the enforcement officer or the responsible person contesting the administrative citation before issuing a written decision.

(l)    The failure of any responsible person contesting an administrative citation to appear at the administrative citation hearing shall constitute a forfeiture of the advance deposit and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the order of the citation shall become the final determination.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.10 Hearing Officer’s Decision.

(a)    After considering all of the relevant, admissible testimony and evidence, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision to uphold or dismiss all or part of the administrative citation, listing the reasons for the decision.

(b)    If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation shall be upheld, the City shall retain the deposited fine amount in satisfaction. If the fine deposit has not been made because the responsible person obtained an advance deposit hardship waiver, the hearing officer shall set forth a reasonable payment schedule. The hearing officer may also impose conditions and deadlines to correct the violation, or require payment of any outstanding fines, penalties, and interest.

(c)    If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be dismissed in whole or in part, the City shall refund the applicable amount of the deposited fine within fifteen (15) days from the date of issuance of the hearing officer’s decision.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.12 Abatement by the City.

(a)    In the event the owner shall neglect or refuse to comply with a final determination, where all rights to appeal are either exhausted or waived, the City may abate the nuisance or correct the violation.

(b)    The abatement or correction shall be pursued by City personnel or private contractor. The City’s authority to abate shall include but not be limited to injunctive relief, the power to condemn, destroy, or demolish any property constituting the nuisance if the nuisance cannot feasibly be abated without destruction of the property. The City shall keep an itemized account of the expenses, including incidental expenses, incurred by the City in the abatement. Upon completion of the abatement, the City shall prepare a report specifying the work done, the itemized and total cost of the work, a description of the real property upon which the abatement was located, and the names and addresses of the owner and responsible person. The itemized report shall be billed to the owner and responsible person, and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after service. The City may make the expense of the summary abatement of the nuisance a debt collectible in the same manner as any other property-related civil debt owing to the City and thus may be made a special assessment or lien upon the property as provided in this chapter.

(c)    In the event that the owner or responsible person fails to consent to the City entering the subject property for the purpose of inspecting and/or abating a nuisance or correcting a violation under this chapter, the City shall apply and be granted the warrant from a judge of a court of record if cause exists pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1822.50.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.13 Summary Abatement.

Whenever any condition on or use of property causes or constitutes or reasonably appears to cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health, welfare, or safety of the public, or when immediate action is required to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property or essential public services, any enforcement officer shall have the authority to institute the following procedures:

(a)    The enforcement officer shall attempt to make contact through a personal interview, or by telephone, with the owner or the responsible person, if any, occupying or otherwise in real or apparent charge and control thereof. In the event contact is made, the enforcement officer shall notify such person or persons of the danger involved and require that the condition be immediately removed, repaired, or isolated so as to preclude harm to any person or property.

(b)    If the enforcement officer is unable to make contact as described above, or if the appropriate persons, after notification by the enforcement officer, do not take action as specified by the enforcement officer, then the enforcement officer may, within seventy-two (72) hours or less if reasonably necessary, take all steps deemed necessary to remove or isolate the dangerous condition, or conditions, so long as the enforcement officer is acting with the City Manager’s authorization.

(c)    Summary abatement actions shall not be subject to the same citation requirements of this chapter, and an enforcement officer shall not be prohibited from summary abatement actions after initiation of proceedings pursuant to this chapter if immediate action at any time becomes necessary to preserve or protect the public health, welfare, or safety. Summary abatement is to be limited to those actions which are reasonably necessary to immediately remove the threat.

(d)    The expense of summarily abating a nuisance shall be a charge against the persons creating, causing, or committing or maintaining it. The City may make the expense of the summary abatement of the nuisance a debt collectible in the same manner as any other property-related civil debt owing to the City and thus may be made a special assessment or lien upon the property.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.14 Recovery of Costs and Attorneys’ Fees.

To the extent allowed by law, the City may elect to recover its costs to abate nuisance conditions or other code violations, including without limitation the costs of any administrative hearings, staff time necessary to prepare for and attend an administrative hearing, any reinspections required to determine or confirm compliance has been achieved, production of all staff reports, third-party inspections or consultant services as deemed necessary by the City and any attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing enforcement. If the City elects at the initiation of an administrative enforcement action or other proceeding to seek recovery of attorneys’ fees, pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5(b), then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees in an amount not to exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the City in such action. Recovery by the City of the costs of enforcement shall be in addition to any penalty imposed on the responsible party.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)


1-7.15 Collection of Unpaid Fines and Costs.

To recover any past due administrative citation fine(s), penalties, and recoverable costs:

(a)    The enforcement officer shall cause a copy of the citation(s) to be filed with the Building Division of the Community Development Department.

(b)    An invoice for the citation fine(s) and recoverable costs shall be mailed to the owner and/or responsible party. The invoice for property-related citations shall include notification that if not paid within forty-five (45) days of the due date, a nuisance abatement lien or a special assessment lien may be recorded against the property. The invoice for nonproperty-related citations shall include notification that if not paid within thirty (30) days of the due date, the account may be referred to a collection agency.

(c)    If the responsible party does not pay the nonproperty-related citation fine and recoverable costs within thirty (30) days from the due date, the account may be forwarded to a collection agency.

(d)    If the property-related citation fine and/or recoverable costs remain unpaid beyond forty-five (45) days from the due date, the City Manager may submit the matter as a report to the City Council for a lien-attachment hearing, either as to attaching a nuisance abatement lien or a special assessment lien. The report shall include: the names and address of the record owner of the property and all persons having a recorded interest in the property; a description of the real property subject to the lien; and the total costs.

At least ten (10) days prior to the lien-attachment hearing, the City Clerk shall give notice, by certified mail or by posting on the property, of the hearing to all persons named in the report. The notice shall describe the property by assessor’s parcel number and street number or some other description sufficient to enable identification of the property, and contain a statement of the amount of the proposed assessment.

At the lien-attachment hearing, the City Council shall hear the report and the objections of any of the owners liable to be assessed for the costs, or any other persons who may have a legal interest in the property. The City Council may add to the proposed assessment an amount for the cost of conducting the lien-attachment hearing, and may make modifications in the report as it deems necessary, after which, the City Council may order the report as confirmed. The order and modified report shall be filed with the City Clerk, deemed as final and conclusive. The confirmed amounts and costs contained in the report shall constitute either a nuisance abatement lien or a special assessment lien against the property, and are a lien on the property for the respective amount.

(e)    The assessment shall continue until it is paid, together with interest at the legal maximum rate computed from the date of confirmation of the statement until complete payment.

(f)    For special assessment liens, the County Assessor shall enter each assessment on the County tax roll upon the parcel of land. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment; however, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. The Tax Collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005A, eff. Nov. 17, 2016)

3-3.503 Constitutional, Statutory, and Other Exemptions.

(a)    Nothing in this Article shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any person or service when the imposition of such tax upon such person or service would be in violation of a federal or State statute, the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State.

(b)    Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this Article pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall file an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name for such service. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the service user’s tax-exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users’ taxes collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as a result of such noncompliance.

The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3-3.519 of this Article. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 3-3.519 of this Article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(c)    Residential Exemption.

(1)    Eligibility. Any service user who is personally responsible for the payment of the utility services subject to this tax and who personally pays for those services shall be eligible for an exemption from the taxes imposed by this Article on service supplied to the service user’s residential living quarters if the aggregate gross income of all persons who share the service user’s residential living quarters does not exceed the sum of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) per year. Only one (1) such residential exemption shall be allowed to any person. The person in whose name the utility services are established with the utility companies will be deemed to be the person responsible for purposes of this section. The provisions of this exemption shall also apply to any individual who meets the criterion of disability, as established by the Social Security Administration’s Supplemental Income Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (Title XVI of the Social Security Act as amended).

(2)    Application. Applications for exemption may be filed with the Tax Administrator at any time on such forms as may be provided.

(3)    Effective Date. The application shall be approved or denied by the Tax Administrator within seventy-five (75) days of receipt.

(4)    Contents of the Application. Applications shall be verified by declaration under penalty of perjury and shall contain such information and shall certify the service users as exempt if the eligibility requirements of subsection (a) of this section are met, except that no exemption shall be granted to a service user who is receiving service from a service supplied through a master meter and no exemption shall be granted with respect of any tax imposed by this Article which is or has been paid by a public agency or where the service user receives funds from a public agency specifically for the payment of such tax.

(5)    Notice to Service Supplier. If a service is certified as exempt, the Tax Administrator shall promptly notify the service user’s service suppliers stating the name of the service user, the address to which such exempt service is being supplied, the account number, if any, and such other information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt service user from its tax billing procedure.

(6)    Discontinuance of Tax. Upon receipt of such notice, the service supplier shall within sixty (60) days discontinue billing the service user for taxes imposed by this Article, except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(7) of this section.

(7)    Prior Taxes to Be Collected. Taxes billed by the service supplier to the service user, prior to removing the service user from its tax billing procedure, shall be collected from the service user and the service user shall pay such taxes to the service supplier. Taxes billed to and paid by the service user who is eligible for exemption between the time when an application is submitted and when the service supplier removes the service user from its taxing procedure shall be refunded to the service user.

(8)    Duration of Exemption. Exemptions certified by the Tax Administrator shall continue so long as the facts supporting qualification for the exemption shall exist. The exemption will automatically terminate with any change in service address or residence of the exempt individual. The individual may apply for a new exemption with each change of address of residence.

(9)    Duty to Disclose Disqualification. Any service user who has been exempted under this section shall notify the City within ten (10) days of any change in fact or circumstance that might disqualify the individual from receiving such exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefit of the exemption provided by this section when the basis for such exemptions does not exist or ceases to exist. Any service supplier who determines by any means that a new or nonexempt service user is receiving service through a meter or connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or exempt user of the same meter or connection shall immediately notify the Tax Administrator of such fact and the Tax Administrator shall conduct an investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have been complied with, and, when appropriate, order the service supplier to commence collecting the tax from the nonexempt service user.

(10)    Audit by the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall have the power and right to demand evidence of continued eligibility of a service user for exemption under the provisions of this section. Such evidence may include, but need not be limited to, copies of business records, letter or statements from the Social Security Administration and State, County, City and private pension administrators or unemployment or welfare agencies, and such other evidence concerning the service user or other member of his or her household as may tend to prove or disprove such eligibility. Failure to provide such evidence as is within the control of a service user to provide, either directly or by consent of a member of the household, when such evidence is requested may be the basis for immediate discontinuance of the service user’s eligibility for exemption under the provisions of this section. Evidence provided to the Tax Administrator at the Tax Administrator’s request or voluntarily provided by the service user without the Tax Administrator’s request may not be used against such service user as evidence in violation of the provisions of this section. Such evidence may only be used as grounds for termination of the exemption herein provided. (Sec. 1 (part), Ord. 07-014, eff. Nov. 6, 2007)


3-3.504 Maximum Amount Paid.

The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to communication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this Article, sourcing rules for the taxation of other communication services, including but not limited to postpaid communication services, prepaid communication services, and private communication services; provided, that such rules are based upon custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multijurisdictional taxation.

(c)    The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to communication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this Article, an administrative ruling identifying those communication services, or charges therefor, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this section.

(e)    To prevent actual multijurisdictional taxation of communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or local jurisdiction on such communication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or local jurisdiction; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the City under this section.

(f)    The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month.

(3)    Storage charges; provided, however, that the service supplier shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service supplier cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction;

(a)    Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Section 3-3.506 or by Section 3-3.507 of this Article which produces gas or electricity for self-use (e.g., cogeneration or distributed generation), which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a nonutility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article, or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service supplier, a nonutility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the City, including any related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the Tax Administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity; provided, that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter.

For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this Article, “substantial nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users’ tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment.

(1)    The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 3-3.515 shall apply.

(2)    The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this Article. Where a service user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

(b)    Filing Return and Payment. Each person required by this Article to remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this Article. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act.

(b)    If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users’ tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax collected on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of fifteen (15%) percent of the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of 75/100ths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

(c)    The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen (15%) percent of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.

(d)    For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of this Article to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other public agencies imposing a utility users’ tax, or otherwise legally established, to create a central payment location or mechanism.

3-3.513 Actions to Collect.

Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this Article shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Article shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this Article, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person’s noncompliance with this Article, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C).

(a)    The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly applying or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges.

(b)    The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of 75/100ths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the City. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter.

(c)    If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the City. If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.

(d)    At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed to the City Manager pursuant to Section 3-3.519 of this Article. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 3-3.519 of this Article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(e)    Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of 75/100ths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the City seeking payment of a tax assessed under this Article shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection (e).

(f)    All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.

3-3.515 Administrative Remedy – Nonpaying Service Users.

(a)    Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this Article from certain named service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this Article.

(b)    In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of 75/100ths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date until paid.

(c)    The Tax Administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

(d)    If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed.

A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office.

(c)    Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this Article and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this Article; or (2) avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the City at any time.

(d)    The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this Article, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this Article.

Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 3-3.514 of this Article for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this Article, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness.

(e)    Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this Article for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days; provided, that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of 75/100ths percent (0.75%) per month, prorated for any portion thereof.

(f)    The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this Article.

In determining whether the noncollection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedents.

3-3.518 Refunds.

Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this Article from a person or service supplier, it may be refunded as provided in this section:

(a)    The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this Article from a person or service supplier; provided, that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor, or administrator has submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided by this subsection.

(b)    The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in excess of the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the City, shall act upon the refund claim within forty-five (45) days of the initial receipt of the refund claim. Said decision shall be final. If the Tax Administrator/City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the forty-five (45) day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Tax Administrator/City Council on the forty-fifth (45th) day. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913.

(c)    The filing of a written claim pursuant to Government Code Section 935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the City pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Government Code Sections 945.6 and 946.

(d)    Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Tax Administrator may, at his or her discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected and remitted any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this Article, to claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the City upon a subsequent monthly return(s) to the Tax Administrator; provided, that: (1) such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous collection of said tax; (2) the Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and amount of such credit has been reasonably established; and (3) in the case of an overpayment by a service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to the City, the Tax Administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier to the service user in an amount equal to the requested credit.

(e)    Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (d) of this section, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the City within the three (3) years next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment by the Tax Administrator in connection with an audit instituted by the Tax Administrator pursuant to Section 3-3.516(d). A service supplier shall not be entitled to said credit unless it clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a service supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the one- year written claim requirement of this section.

The Tax Administrator may rely on the declaration as to the amount of the tax due; provided, that he or she has no reason to believe that the full amount of the tax due is not shown on the declaration.

Whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that the full amount of tax due is not shown on the declaration or has not been paid, he or she may, by notice served upon any person liable for the tax, require them to furnish a true copy of their records relevant to the value of the consideration or fair market value of the property transferred.

3-9.103    Severability

Article 1.    Property and Business Improvement Districts


3-9.101 Purpose.

(a)    State law provides procedures to form property and business improvement districts. This article provides authority for the City to invoke those State procedures and, in addition, to apply those procedures to residential property that would not be covered were the City to follow the State law exclusively. This article incorporates the State law and then specifies how the City Council may choose to augment the State law provisions by choosing to: (1) reduce the percentage of petitions required from owners in order to initiate formation and allow the City Council to initiate formation by adoption of a resolution; (2) extend the term of the district to a maximum of fifteen (15) years, unless a longer term is authorized by State law; (3) have the district encompass and assess residential property; (4) specifically affirm that shuttle bus services constitute an activity that may benefit businesses or real property in a district; or (5) authorize the district to recover through assessments the costs incurred in its formation. In addition, this article augments State law by authorizing the City Council to disestablish a district upon a supermajority vote of the Council.

(b)    Through proceedings under this article, the City Council may establish property and business improvement districts and may finance enhancements through annual assessments apportioned among parcels of real property within such districts. It is the intent of this article to provide a vehicle for financing enhancements which supplement and complement existing services. District formation and assessment proceedings may not be initiated under this article to finance replacing or supplanting existing City services. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the establishment of districts to finance local capital improvements under any other ordinance or any other law of the State of California.

(Sec. 1 (part), Ord. 15-003, eff. May 7, 2015)


3-9.102 Emeryville Procedural and Substantive Augmentation of State Law Requirements Governing Property and Business Improvement Districts.

(a)    In forming assessment districts that will fund improvements and services that confer special benefit on businesses, residential, commercial or residential and commercial property, the City Council may elect to use the procedures set forth in California Streets and Highways Code Section 36600 et seq., or may elect to use those procedures as modified herein. The City Council shall be bound by, and comply with, the applicable State law governing the formation of property and business improvement and maintenance districts in all other respects not inconsistent with this article when forming an assessment district to fund improvements and services that provide special benefits to businesses, commercial and/or residential property.

(b)    Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36621(a) or any other provision of State law, the City Council may initiate proceedings to establish a property and business improvement district by adoption of a resolution on its own motion at a regular or special meeting, or upon receipt of a petition signed by property owners, business owners, or a combination of property owners and business owners in the proposed district who will pay at least thirty percent (30%) of the assessments proposed to be levied. The amount of assessment attributable to property and businesses owned by the same owner that is in excess of forty percent (40%) of the amount of all assessments proposed to be levied shall not be included in determining whether the petition is signed by the property owners, business owners, or combination of property owners and business owners, as the case may be, who will pay the requisite percentage of assessments. Where the City Council initiates proceedings pursuant to this subsection, the City Council shall conduct a protest ballot proceeding in accordance with Article XIII(D) of the California Constitution notwithstanding any language to the contrary in Streets and Highways Code Section 36623.

(c)    Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36622(h) or any other provision of State law, the City Council may form a district authorized to levy assessments for a maximum term of up to fifteen (15) years, except where a longer term is authorized by State law.

(d)    Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36632(c) or any other provision of State law, the City Council may establish an assessment district pursuant to this article that encompasses, and levies assessments upon, and funds improvements and services that specially benefit properties zoned for residential use.

(e)    Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36606 or any other provision of State law, activities that may benefit businesses or real property in a district include the provision of shuttle bus services.

(f)    The City Council may authorize an assessment district formed pursuant to this article to recover through assessments the costs incurred in forming the district, including:

(1)    The costs of preparation of the management plan and engineer’s report required by State law;

(2)    The cost of circulating and submitting the petition to the City Council seeking establishment of the district;

(3)    The costs of printing, advertising and the giving of published, posted or mailed notices;

(4)    Compensation of any engineer or attorney employed to render services in proceedings under this article or Streets and Highways Code Section 36600 et seq.; and

(5)    Costs associated with any ballot proceedings required by law for approval of a new or increased assessment.

If the district will be authorized to recover these costs, the management plan required pursuant to Streets and Highways Code Section 36622 shall specify the formation costs eligible for recovery through assessments, the schedule for recovery of those costs, and the basis for determining the amount of the additional assessment for recovery of costs, including the maximum amount of the additional assessment, expressed either as a dollar amount, or as a percentage of the underlying assessment.

(g)    Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36670 or any other provision of State law, the City Council may, by a supermajority vote of four (4) or more members, notice a hearing and initiate proceedings to disestablish for any reason a district formed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. Where the City Council seeks to disestablish a district in circumstances not authorized under Streets and Highways Code Section 36670, both the resolution of intention to disestablish the district and any final resolution to disestablish the district shall be subject to a supermajority vote of four (4) or more members. This subsection shall not be applicable where the district has outstanding bonded indebtedness.

(Sec. 1 (part), Ord. 15-003, eff. May 7, 2015)


3-9.103 Severability.

If any provision of this article or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision or such other application of such provision which can be given effect without such provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this article are declared to be severable.

The operation of ongoing cabarets and dance halls, as well as one-time cabaret and dance events, have the demonstrated potential for generating noise, crowd and traffic problems, interference with neighbors’ enjoyment and use of their property, disorderly conduct, vandalism and other criminal activity. Such uses thus require close coordination with the planning and land use process. Therefore, the City Council determines that the public health, safety and welfare requires the establishment of regulations for the operation of ongoing cabarets and dance halls, as well as for one-time cabaret and public dancing events. The City Council finds it necessary to regulate:

(a)    The persons who will own and/or operate cabarets and dance halls, as well as conduct occasional cabaret or public dance events;

(b)    The location and operation of cabarets and public dances in the City, including noise, hours of operation and patron security and safety; and

(g)    In the event grantee claims to have overpaid by more than five percent (5%) the amount of franchise fee actually due during any given quarter, it shall file an application with the City within one year after said payment was made.

All such applications shall state the amount of claimed overpayment, the reason for the claimed overpayment, and sufficient documentation to allow the City to verify grantee’s claim. Upon request by the City, grantee shall provide any further information that is deemed relevant by the City.

(b)    Administration and Appeals.

(1)    The City Manager or the City Manager’s designee is authorized to administer this Section 5-22.43. Decisions by the City Manager to assess monetary penalties against the grantee must be in writing and must contain findings supporting the decisions. The written decision shall be filed with the City Clerk and a copy thereof shall be served on the appellant in accordance with Section 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

(2)    If the grantee or any interested person (“appellant”) is aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager made pursuant to this section, the aggrieved party may, within ten (10) days of the written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the City Clerk. Such appeal shall be in a form prescribed by the City Clerk. The appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the City Council for processing the appeal.

a.    The hearing officer shall be selected by the City Manager and compensated for the time expended in providing such service based upon a written agreement for that purpose. The hearing officer’s employment or compensation shall not be based on the outcome rendered by the hearing officer. If the appellant so elects in writing prior to the hearing, the appellant shall be entitled to pay for one half (1/2) of the costs of the services of the hearing officer.

b.    The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing officer on the date, time and place specified by the hearing officer. The hearing shall proceed solely on the issues or defenses raised in the request for a hearing filed by the appellant, and all matters not contested in said request shall be deemed admitted.

c.    The appellant shall have the burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that either: (1) the City Manager has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; (2) there was not a fair trial; or (3) there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the City Manager has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. The City Manager’s written decision and findings shall be admitted into evidence and shall constitute prima facie evidence of all matters contained therein. The parties may present such other evidence and reports as may be necessary or helpful to the hearing officer to resolve the issues raised by the citee.

d.    The parties shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence relevant to the matters raised in the appeal.

e.    The City Manager’s written decision and findings, and other reports prepared by the City Manager, or at his or her request, concerning the alleged violation or violations or their attempted correction shall be accepted by the hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the violation or violations.

f.    The hearing shall be conducted informally and the rules of evidence need not be followed; provided however that the decision of the hearing officer on any material issue may not be based upon hearsay evidence alone. The hearing officer may adopt such supplementary rules of procedure and evidence as may be useful in a determination of the issues involved, to the extent such rules are not otherwise provided for herein.

g.    The failure of the appellant to appear at the hearing shall constitute a waiver of his or her contest to the City Manager’s decision and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the City Manager’s decision. Such failure to appear shall constitute an admission of the truth of all matters contained in the City Manager’s decision, which shall be ordered in the decision of the hearing officer.

h.    The hearing officer may continue the hearing upon the request of the appellant, or the appellant’s representative, or the representative of the City, or on the hearing officer’s own motion, upon a showing of good cause. All continuance requests shall be made in writing. If the continuance is granted, a new hearing date shall be set, which continued hearing date shall be within fifteen days.

i.    After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue his or her written decision within five business days following the conclusion of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall either uphold or deny the City Manager’s decision or any portion thereof and state the facts and reasons supporting the decision. The hearing officer also shall order any remedy necessary to effectuate the hearing officer’s decision, including, but not limited to, a revision of the amount of money owed by the grantee after due consideration of the circumstances pursuant to subparagraph (B)(6)(b), below. The written decision shall be filed with the City Clerk and a copy thereof shall be served on the appellant in accordance with Section 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

j.    All decisions and orders of a hearing officer shall become final unless appealed as provided herein.

k.    The appellant or the City may seek judicial review of the decision of the hearing officer by filing an appeal with the Superior Court within ninety (90) days in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. No appeal shall be permitted from a decision based upon the failure of the appellant to appear at the administrative hearing or upon any other waiver of the administrative hearing by the appellant.

1.    If an appeal of any decision or order of a hearing officer that ordered the appellant to pay any amount due is affirmed by the reviewing court, in whole or part, the court shall enter an order requiting the appellant to pay such amount and said order shall constitute a money judgment.

(3)    Schedule of Penalties. The following schedule of monetary penalties may be assessed against the grantee for the material violation of the provisions of the customer service standards set forth in this section, provided that the violation is within the reasonable control of the grantee:

a.    The maximum penalty for a first material violation is two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each day of the material violation, except with respect to an entity receiving a state franchise, the maximum penalty shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day of each material breach, but not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for each occurrence of the material violation.

(1)    The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or extension.

(2)    The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the City, at specified times, fees on the gross revenue received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR § 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and procedures:

a.    The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be five percent (5%), and will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees authorized under Section 622 of the Communications Act.

The term “OVS gross revenue” does not include revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers and other exclusions described in the definition of “gross revenues” defined within Section 5-22.03 of this chapter.

(3)    The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the OVS gross revenue that are required to be paid as specified above in paragraph (B)(2).

(4)    The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the City’s requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR § 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are applicable:

a.    The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational, and governmental access channel requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.

b.    The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public, educational, and government access channels within the franchise service area in which the City’s subscribers are located.

c.    The open video system operator may negotiate with the City to establish the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and government access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment. These negotiations may include the City’s franchised cable operator if the City, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire.

d.    If the open video system operator and the City are unable to reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and government access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment within the City’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be imposed:

i.    The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational, and government access channel obligations as the City’s franchised cable operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, educational, and governmental access and by matching the City’s franchised cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of public, educational, and government access services, facilities, and equipment that are actually used by the City. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the City’s franchised cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services to the City are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the City the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator’s depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act.

ii.    The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity designated for public, educational, and government access channel use when that capacity is not being used fir such purposes.

e.    The City’s franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public, educational, and government access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable-operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the City has the right to decide. The City may require that the connection occur on City-owned property or on public rights-of-way.

f.    All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s public, educational, and government access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video system operator’s matching financial contributions set forth above in subparagraph (d)(i).

g.    The City will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational, or government access channel obligations that are more favorable or less burdensome than those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.

h.    If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR § 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator.

i.    The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply with new public, education, and access channel obligations imposed on the City’s franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open video system to accommodate public, educational, and government access channels. The open video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and government access channel obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity.

(5)    If the City and the open video system operator cannot agree on the application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s obligations to provide public, educational, and government access channel under the provisions of subsection (4) set forth above, then either party may file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47 CFR § 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the City until the dispute has been finally resolved.

(6)    If the open video system operator intends to maintain an institutional network, as defined in Section 61l(i) of the Communications Act, the City will require that educational and government access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels are designated on the institutional network of the City’s franchised cable operator. In addition, to the extent authorized by federal law, the open video system operator may be required by the City to satisfy the same financial obligations and other requirements that are imposed upon the franchised cable operator to support data-transmission and related services that are provided by the institutional network.

(7)    The authority of an open video system provider to exercise editorial control over any public, educational, or government use of channel capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR § 76.1505(0.

(8)    The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, and regulations relating to customer service standards, including the Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act (Government Code §§ 53054, et seq.), the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code §§ 53088, et seq.), and Section 5.22.033 of Chapter 5.22 of this title.

(9)    If a new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the City, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also imposed by the City upon other telecommunications service providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:

a.    Compliance with all applicable City codes, including applications for excavation, encroachment, and construction permits and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees.

Part 8    Other Video and Telecommunications Services and Systems


5-22.59 Other Multichannel Video Programming Distributors.

(a)    The term “cable system” does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be “cable systems” and are therefore exempt from the City’s franchise requirements and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the use of the City’s public rights-of-way.

Local regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the following federal statutory provisions:

(1)    47 U.S.C. § 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite services.

(2)    Section 602 of the Communications Act states that a provider of direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct-to-home satellite service. The terms “tax” and “fee” are defined by federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any other tax, license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business, regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction.

5-22.61 Telecommunications Service Provided by Telephone Corporations.

Any video programming that is provided by a telephone corporation that uses public rights-of-way in the delivery of the video programming, regardless of the technology used, will be considered a cable service under this chapter unless such programming is otherwise expressly authorized by state or federal law.

(a)    In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations and requirements set forth in the recitals to the ordinance codified in this chapter, the following regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to be constructed within the City’s public rights-of-way:

(1)    The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit (“ministerial permit.”);

(2)    In addition to the information required by this Code in connection with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must submit to the City the following supplemental information:

a.    A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the City’s public rights-of-way.

b.    If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of public convenience to operate as a “competitive local carrier,” the following additional requirements are applicable:

i.    As required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the applicant must establish that it has filed with the City in a timely manner a quarterly report that describes the type of construction and the location of each construction project proposed to be undertaken in the City during the calendar quarter in which the application is filed, which information is sufficient to enable the City to coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary.

ii.    If the applicant’s proposed construction project will extend beyond the utility rights-of-way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-way, the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.

iii.    The applicant must inform the City whether its proposed construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures specified in the Negative Declaration [“Competitive Local Carriers (CLCs) Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California”] or to the Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC. The city’s issuance of a ministerial permit shall be conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with all applicable mitigation measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone corporations that are designated as “competitive local carriers.”

(b)    In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement, and for the purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the City, the following policies and procedures are adopted:

(1)    The City Manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities, including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction, maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to, a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the public rights-of-way.

(2)    The City Manager is directed to coordinate the construction and installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public rights-of-way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street construction or renovation projects, the City Manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or “windows” for the installation of facilities within the public rights-of-way. Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly “window” that is established by the City.

(c)    Should a telephone corporation apply for a state video service franchise under state law, the telephone corporation shall comply with all notice requirements of state law regarding the corporation’s application.

(d)    Should a telephone corporation be granted a local franchise under this ordinance or be granted a state “video service” franchise, said corporation must satisfy the interconnection requirements associated with connectivity to each PEG access origination facility. This interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable connection, microwave link, satellite, fiber, or other appropriate method sufficient to provide NTSC quality video signals. Telephone corporation shall bear all costs of such interconnection and related maintenance.

5-23.1 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a process for permitting community events to use City streets, parks, open space, facilities or services. The City recognizes the substantial community benefits that may result from community events. Such events can provide cultural enrichment, promote economic vitality and enhance community identity. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a coordinated process for managing community events to ensure the health and safety of event patrons, residents, participants, visitors; to prohibit illegal activities from occurring at the community events; and to protect the rights of community event permit holders.

It is also the intent of the City Council of the City of Emeryville to protect the rights of people to engage in expressive activities in the City’s public places and to establish the least restrictive and reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of these activities. It is further intended to create mechanisms for cost recovery and use charges, to the extent authorized by law, while not unduly impacting the viability of events.

(Sec. 4 (part), Ord. 07-012, eff. Nov. 15, 2007)

The purpose of this chapter is to improve ambient air quality by reducing air pollutant emissions that result from vehicle commute trips to work sites with fifty (50) or more employees.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 94-007, eff. June 2, 1994)


5-26.1.2 Legal Authority.

The State of California Clean Air Act (AB 2595, Sher) required the adoption and implementation of transportation control measures as part of the Clean Air Plan adopted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) in June 1992. In December 1992, the BAAQMD adopted Regulation 13, Rule 1, Trip Reduction Requirements of Large Employers (Rule 1). This program was considered a “reasonably available” transportation control measure under the State of California Clean Air Act. Section 40717.4(e) of the California Health and Safety Code gives the BAAQMD the authority to delegate implementation of transportation control measures, such as Rule 1, to local jurisdictions. Rule 1 Sections 13-1 104 and 13 1 302 specify the process and criteria to be used for local jurisdictions to receive delegation and implement Rule 1 through locally adopted trip reduction ordinances.

If an employer has fifty (50) or more employees but no single work site with fifty (50) or more employees, this chapter does not apply to that employer. For purposes of determining the applicability of this chapter, the number of employees at a work site is determined as the maximum number of employees reporting to that work site on any single weekday Monday through Friday during the current calendar or fiscal year. Employment centers will consider all employees of all employers located with the employment center to be part of the center’s work site for purposes of registering, developing Employment Trip Reduction Information Campaign Programs, and submitting Trip Reduction Information Campaign Plans.

(i)    The total number of employees who start work or are assigned to a work site during the peak period each work day Monday through Friday of the survey week. Each day of the survey week that an employee starts work during the peak period counts as one (1) employee day. For example, an employee who starts work each day Monday through Friday of the survey week between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. counts as five (5) employee days. The following procedures are used in totaling employee days:

1.    Employees telecommuting or who are off due to a compressed work week schedule are counted as reporting to the work site in calculating the total employee days.

(ii)    The following employees are not included in the employee days total:

1.    Employees not working because of vacation, sickness, or other time off;

2.    Employees who report to a different work site or an off-site work-related activity;

3.    Disabled employees.

(h)    Vehicle trip days shall be determined as follows:

(i)    The total number of vehicles used by employees who start work or are assigned to the work site each work day Monday through Friday of the survey week. A vehicle trip day is based on the means of transportation used for the greatest distance of an employee’s home-to-work commute trip. An employee who starts work during the peak period and arrives at the work site each day of the survey week Monday through Friday in a single-occupant vehicle counts as five (5) vehicle trip days. The following numerical values are used in calculating the total vehicle trip days:

1.    Single-occupant vehicle (drive alone) equals one (1);

2.    Carpool equals one (1) divided by the number of people in the carpool;

3.    Vanpool equals one (1) divided by the number of employees in the vanpool;

4.    Motorcycle, moped, motorized scooter, or motor bike equal one (1);

5.    Clean fueled vehicles are counted as follows:

i.    Electric vehicle equals zero (0),

ii.    Compressed natural gas vehicle equals one fourth (0.25),

iii.    Propane vehicle equals one half (0.5),

iv.    Dual or flexible fueled vehicle equals three fourths (0.75);

6.    The following all equal zero (0) vehicle trip days:

i.    Public transit (bus, light rail, ferry, Amtrak, BART),

ii.    Private buspool or club bus,

iii.    Bicycle,

iv.    Walking and other nonmotorized transportation modes,

v.    Employees telecommuting (only on the days those employees are telecommuting for the entire day),

vi.    Employees who work a compressed work week schedule (only on their compressed day(s) off),

vii.    Disabled employee vehicles at all times.

(i)    Employers or employment centers with multiple work sites within the jurisdiction have the option to average individual work site AVR or VER to demonstrate that the performance objectives are achieved on an aggregate basis for those work sites when this jurisdiction is implementing this chapter. If the employer demonstrates that the performance objectives (Section 5-26.6.1) are achieved using the averaging methodology, then those work sites included in the averaging are not subject to the requirements of Section 5-26.7.10.

(i)    The weighted AVR average for the multiple work sites is calculated by (1) adding together the “employee days” for each work site, (2) adding together the “vehicle trip days” for each work site, then (3) dividing the aggregate “employee days” by the aggregate “vehicle trip days” to obtain the weighted AVR average.

(ii)    The weighted VER average for the multiple work sites is calculated by dividing the aggregate “vehicle trip days” by the aggregate “employee days.”

(iii)    The weighted VER average for multiple work sites can also be calculated as the number of peak-period employees multiplied by VER (Site 1) plus the number of peak-period employees multiplied by VER (Site 2) divided by the total peak-period employees (Sites 1 and 2).

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 94-007, eff. June 2, 1994)


5-26.9.2 Random Sample Method.

The method described in this section must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of Section 5-26.9.1.

(a)    Summary:

(i)    Section 5-26.7.6(c) provides an option for larger work sites to calculate AVR or VER based upon a random sample of the employee population. The random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred (400) or more employees start work during the peak period (6:00 a.m. through 10:00 a.m.).

(ii)    The size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site. The means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in Section 5-26.9.2(b)(ii).

(iii)    The sample must be selected as described in Section 5-26.9.2(b)(iv). Once the sample group has been selected, the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group. This will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employer’s option to utilize the random sample method.

(iv)    A high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate AVR or VER for the work site. The employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample. All nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive-alone commuters (i.e. commuting in a single-occupant vehicle) for purposes of calculating the work site AVR or VER.

(b)    Basic Random Sample Selection Methodology.

(i)    The employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site, in alphabetical order, and assign a consecutive number to each employee. The employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the 6:00 a.m. through 10:00 a.m. peak period.

(ii)    The employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula, where n is the sample size and N is the number of employees who start work between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.
[IMAGE]


A sample of size “n” based on this formula should produce an AVR or VER with a sampling error of at most plus-or-minus 0.05, with a ninety-five percent (95%) probability. The sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below:

	Number of Peak Period Employees at Work Site	Sample Size

	400 to 420	200

	421 to 440	205

	441 to 460	210

	461 to 480	214

	481 to 500	218

	501 to 550	225

	551 to 600	235

	601 to 650	240

	651 to 700	248

	701 to 750	255

	751 to 800	260

	801 to 850	265

	851 to 900	270

	901 to 950	274

	951 to 1000	278

	1001 to 1500	300

	1501 to 2000	320

	2001 to 3000	340

	3001 to 4000	350

	4001 to 6000	360

	6001 to 10,000	370

	> 10,000	380

(iii)    In no case can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table. The employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey. A larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population; provided, that the employer obtains a high response rate.

(iv)    After the sample size has been determined, the employer has two options for selecting the sample:

1.    Use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list (e.g., two hundred seventy eight (278) distinct random numbers between one (1) and one thousand (1,000), where one thousand (1,000) employees start work during the peak period).

2.    Select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number.

(v)    To determine the sampling interval, the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the 6:00 a.m. through 10:00 a.m. peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer.

Example: If a work site has 1,000 employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is 278, then the sampling interval equals 1,000 divided by 278 = 3.6. The 3.6 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval. Therefore, every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number X where X is between 1 and 3. If X equals 3, then the sample would include 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc., until the required 278 numbers have been selected.

The methodology described in subsection (b)(iv) of this section will eliminate potential bias that could result from choosing survey participants on the basis of department, rank, income level, home zip code, or other demographic factors, or from excluding certain segments of the employee population.

(c)    Selection Process for Subsequent Surveys.

(i)    In subsequent surveys, the employer may select the random sample using the method described in subsection (b) of this section or the employer may choose to survey the same employees that were included in the previous random sample. Employees in the previous random sample group who have left the organization shall be replaced in the new sample by employees selected per subsection (b) of this section. The latter approach may enable the employer to more accurately track changes in commute mode from one survey to the next.

(ii)    If the number of employees who start work between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. has increased or decreased by more than twenty percent (20%) since the last survey, the employer shall select a completely new random sample group using the methodology described in subsection (b) of this section.

(d)    Performance Objective Calculation, Reporting, and Recordkeeping.

(i)    AVR or VER must be calculated according to the methodology described in Section 5-26.9.1.

(ii)    The employer shall submit to the jurisdiction:

a.    The completed survey forms for processing of the results of the survey, according to the schedule in Section 5-26.7.6(f) and (g);

b.    A description of the methodology used to select the random sample;

c.    A tally showing the number of surveys distributed, the number completed, and the number of nonrespondents.

(iii)    The employer shall retain records needed to document adherence to this protocol for a period of at least three (3) years, including the master list used to generate the random sample and the names and numbers selected from that list.

5-28.01 Findings.

(a)    The Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Section 841 et seq.) makes it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense or possess cannabis, and, accordingly, medical cannabis dispensaries are illegal under Federal law;

(b)    In 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to all Federal prosecutors to provide guidance on the enforcement of the Federal Controlled Substances Act as it related to cannabis, indicating that enforcement would not be a priority in states and local jurisdictions that have laws authorizing cannabis-related conduct; that have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests; and that have provided the necessary resources to demonstrate the willingness to enforce their laws and regulations;

(c)    In 2015, Congress began to defund enforcement of the Federal Controlled Substances Act in states where such enforcement activities would prevent states from implementing their own state laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis;

(d)    The voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215 (codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq., “The Compassionate Use Act of 1996”); the intent of Proposition 215 was to enable persons who are in need of cannabis for medical purposes to obtain and use it without fear of State criminal prosecution;

(e)    On October 9, 2015, Governor Brown approved a series of bills commonly referred to as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”), effective on January 1, 2016, which establishes a comprehensive State licensing and regulatory framework for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of medical cannabis, also known as marijuana; and which recognizes the authority of local jurisdictions to either impose additional restrictions or prohibit certain activities related to the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, delivery, and sale of medical cannabis;

(f)    The voters of the State of California approved Proposition 64, known as the “Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act” (“AUMA”), which establishes a comprehensive State licensing and regulatory framework for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of recreational cannabis, also known as marijuana; and which recognizes the authority of local jurisdictions to either impose additional restrictions or prohibit certain activities related to the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, delivery, and sale of recreational cannabis;

(g)    The City Council of the City of Emeryville has recognized, and continues to recognize, the potential adverse impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of its residents and business from secondary effects associated with commercial cannabis activity, which include: offensive odors, trespassing, theft, violent encounters between growers and persons attempting to steal plants, fire hazards, increased crime in and about the dispensary, robberies of customers, negative impacts on nearby businesses, nuisance problems, and increased DUI incidents;

(h)    There is a need to adopt health, safety, and welfare regulations to avoid adverse impacts on the community which may arise from commercial cannabis activity;

(i)    The MCRSA and AUMA set forth a comprehensive framework to regulate cannabis and cannabis products from seed to ingestion by a consumer, which includes uniform health and safety standards designed to implement quality control, a labeling and a track-and-trace program, and other consumer protections, which mitigates against some of the potential adverse impacts identified by the City Council in the past;

(j)    Neighboring local jurisdictions that allow commercial cannabis activity for medical purposes have implemented effective regulatory and enforcement systems that address the adverse impacts that could pose a threat to public safety, health, and welfare;

(k)    An effective regulatory system governing cannabis in the City of Emeryville, as provided in this chapter, will address potential adverse impacts to the public health, welfare, and safety, thereby allowing commercial cannabis activity and other use of cannabis and cannabis products consistent with Federal law as applicable to the State of California and State law.

(Sec. 1 (part), Ord. 17-003, eff. Sep. 1, 2017)

A “secure facility” is defined by Penal Code § 12071(c)(2) as a building that meets certain specifications, including: certain types of locks on all doorways; steel bars on all windows; and steel bars, metal grating, or an alarm system on all heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and service openings. State law allows a firearms dealer to avoid these requirements by utilizing other security features. See Penal Code § 12071(b)(14). Penal Code § 12071(b)(15) explicitly allows local jurisdictions to impose security requirements on firearms dealers that are stricter or at a higher standard than those imposed by State law. 2

Penal Code § 12061(a)(2) addresses the storage of handgun ammunition by sellers. That provision is effective January 1, 2010. See AB 962 (De Leon). “Handgun ammunition” is defined as ammunition principally for use in pistols, revolvers, or other firearms capable of being concealed upon the person, as that term is defined in Penal Code § 12001(a). Penal Code § 12060(b). 3

Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., uses the term “extent of protection” to refer to the amount of alarm protection installed to protect a particular area, room or container. Systems with a No. 3 extent of protection include complete protection for all accessible openings, and partial motion and sound detection at certain other areas of the premises. For more information, see Central Station Alarm Association, A Practical Guide to Central Station Burglar Alarm Systems (3rd ed. 2005). 4

Television in the U.S. has thirty (30) frames per second. However, fifteen (15) frames per second is generally described as viewable, and is used in similar regulations. See, e.g., 02-392-013 Me. Code R. 6(6).

5-31.01 Title and Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to assure that City employees, employees of City service contractors, subcontractors, and employees and contractors of City financial assistance earn an hourly wage that is sufficient to live with dignity and to achieve economic self-sufficiency. The City contracts with many businesses and organizations to provide services to the public, and provides financial assistance to developers and businesses for the purpose of promoting economic development and job growth. Such public expenditures should also be spent to set a community economic standard that permits workers to live out of poverty. The City Council finds that the use of City funds to provide living wage jobs will decrease poverty, increase consumer income, invigorate neighborhood businesses and reduce the need for taxpayer funded social service programs.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Living Wage Ordinance.” The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare. It does this by requiring that public funds be expended in such a manner as to facilitate individual self-reliance by employees of City contractors, lessees, recipients of City financial aid and their respective subcontractors.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 06-019, eff. July. 1, 2007)


5-31.02 Findings.

(a)    The City of Emeryville awards contracts to private firms and other businesses to provide services to the public and to City government; and

(b)    The City of Emeryville has a limited amount of taxpayer resources to expend; and

(c)    The use of taxpayer dollars to promote sustenance and creation of living wage jobs will increase consumer income, decrease levels of poverty and reduce the need for taxpayer-funded social programs in other areas; and

(d)    When City funds are used to contract for services, such contracts should demonstrate an effort to promote an employment environment that enhances the general quality of life within the community and maximizes the productive effect of the City’s limited resources; and

(e)    The City’s use of contractors that do not provide health insurance to their employees can result in imposing the costs of their medical care on the county, state and federal governments; and

(f)    That employees are far likelier to be healthy if their employer provides reasonable health insurance to them and their dependents; and

(g)    The payment of a minimum level of compensation as required by this chapter benefits these interests.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 06-019, eff. July. 1, 2007)

Article 1.    Measure C As Adopted by City of Emeryville Electorate November 8, 2005


5-32.1.1 Minimum Requirements.

No corporation, entity or person may operate a large hotel (as defined in Section 5-32.1.3) without annually obtaining a permit from the City, which shall be granted upon a showing that the following conditions will be followed:

(a)    Minimum Wages. Large hotels shall ensure that employees receive compensation of at least the following:

(1)    Minimum Compensation. The minimum compensation for each employee shall be at least nine dollars ($9.00) per hour.

(2)    Minimum Average Compensation. The average compensation of all employees in the hotel during a calendar year shall be at least eleven dollars ($11.00) per hour.

(3)    Credit for Health Benefits. “Compensation” shall be defined herein as wages (or salary) and health benefits. If employer contributions for health benefits are not paid on an hourly basis but the hotel nonetheless wishes a credit for such payments, the hotel shall present data to the City concerning hours worked and health contributions made, and the City Manager or his designee shall estimate the value of such benefits on an hourly basis.

(4)    Inflation Adjustments. The above rates shall be upwardly adjusted annually, no later than March 1, in proportion to the increase during the preceding calendar year in the region’s Consumer Price Index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. No later than February 1 each year, the City shall distribute a notice reporting the amount of such increase to any person who has filed with the City a request for such notice.

(b)    Protection of Employees from Unjust Discharges When a New Employer Takes Over.

(1)    If there is a sale of the hotel or other change resulting in a new person or entity taking over as an employer at the hotel (such as subcontracting, subleasing, or replacement of subcontractor, lessee or sublessee), then the new employer shall retain all employees of the prior employer for at least ninety (90) calendar days unless there is reasonable and substantiated cause not to hire or to discharge such employee based on that employee’s performance or conduct. The fact that an employee previously enjoyed certain wages, benefits or working conditions does not provide cause for not employing him or her.

(2)    In the event of layoff during the first ninety (90) days of the new employer’s operation, the laid-off employee shall be entitled to reinstatement should any position open up at the hotel within the following twenty-four (24) months which the employee can perform. Upon reinstatement, such employee must be given a trial period of at least ninety (90) days during which he or she can only be discharged for cause as defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section.

(3)    A finding of cause for an employee’s discharge made in a grievance procedure established by collective bargaining agreement shall be binding under subsection (b)(1) of this section, and the term “cause” in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be construed in accordance with judicial and arbitral precedent defining “just cause” for discharge.

(4)    The right to retention herein does not include the right to retain supervisory or management responsibilities.

(c)    Workload Standards for Room Cleaners. Employees working as room cleaners shall be paid at least time-and-a-half the minimum average compensation set forth above for all time worked in a day if required to clean rooms amounting to more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of floor space in an eight (8) hour workday. For any room cleaner working less than eight (8) full hours per day, this maximum floor space shall be prorated evenly according to the actual number of hours worked. When a room cleaner is assigned in an eight (8) hour workday to clean any combination of seven (7) or more checkout rooms or rooms with additional beds such as cots or rollaways, this maximum floor space shall be reduced by five hundred (500) square feet for each such checkout or additional bedroom over six (6).

(d)    Paid Leave for Jury Duty. Each large hotel shall ensure that employees are provided with paid leave for jury duty. The pay during such leave shall be at least the employee’s regular rate of pay as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

(e)    Compliance with Enforcement Provisions. Hotel compliance with the enforcement provisions set forth in Section 5-32.1.4 shall also be a condition for a permit.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 08-005, eff. Sep. 18, 2008)


5-32.1.2 Any City Costs to be Covered by Permit Fees.

Each large hotel shall pay a permit fee annually to the City reflecting its share of any City costs in enforcing this chapter. This share shall be based on each hotel’s portion of the total number of rooms at the hotels covered by this chapter, or based on such other formula as the City Council determines to be equitable. The Council by resolution shall set the initial permit fee based on the City Manager’s projection of the City’s likely costs, and then shall update such fee annually.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 08-005, eff. Sep. 18, 2008)


5-32.1.3 Definitions.

The following definitions shall apply throughout this chapter:

(a)    A “large hotel” means any hospitality facility with more than fifty (50) guest rooms. A “hotel” includes not only the facility’s guest rooms and common areas but also any subcontracted or sublet restaurants connected thereto or operated in conjunction therewith.

(b)    “Employee” includes not only common law employees of the operator, but also persons regularly engaged on the premises in providing services to hotel guests as a contractor, subcontractor, tenant, subtenant, licensee or sublicensee, or as an employee thereof. Workers who are not common law employees of the operator shall not be deemed regularly engaged on the premises unless they spend more than five hours per week there for more than four weeks. The permittee shall remain ultimately liable for compliance with this article regardless of whether or not it is the common law employer of the employees. “Employee” does not include any managerial or administrative employees receiving more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per year in wages, salary, bonus, commission or other compensation from the hotel.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 08-005, eff. Sep. 18, 2008)


5-32.1.4 Enforcement.

(a)    If after notice and hearing the City Council finds a large hotel has violated its permit requirements, the Council shall revoke such permit or attach conditions to the renewal of such permit sufficient to remedy past violations and prevent future violations.

(b)    The City, any City resident or organization operating within the City, or any employee of a large hotel believing the hotel has violated any requirements of this chapter shall be entitled to bring an action in superior or municipal court for injunctive relief and to collect damages for all persons injured by the violation, and collect penalties for the City. Each workday during which the hotel is in violation of this chapter shall be deemed a separate violation for which the hotel shall be liable for a penalty of at least one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day, the amount to be determined by the court. A prevailing plaintiff in such an action shall be entitled to recover from the hotel his expenses in pursuing the action, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The City shall not be liable under this article for any plaintiff’s damages or legal expenses. The remedies set forth herein are not exclusive of any other remedies available at law, and none is a prerequisite for pursuing another remedy.

(c)    No person may discharge or otherwise discriminate against any other person for making a complaint, participating in any of its proceedings, using any civil remedies to enforce his or her rights, or otherwise asserting his or her rights under this chapter.

(d)    Any waiver by an individual of any provisions of this chapter shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable, except that employees are not barred from entering into a written valid collective bargaining agreement waiving provisions of this chapter if such waiver is set forth in clear and unambiguous terms.

(e)    Each large hotel shall maintain for each employee a record of his or her name, pay rate and, if the hotel claims credit for health benefits, the sums paid by the hotel for the employee’s health benefits. By March 31 of each year, the hotel shall submit to the City a copy of such records for the prior year. Failure to provide a copy of such records within ten (10) days of the due date will result in a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day.

(f)    Each large hotel shall give written notification to each current employee, and to each new employee at time of hire, of his or her rights under this chapter. The notification shall be in each language spoken by more than ten (10) employees.

(g)    Each large hotel in the City shall permit reasonable access to its workforce inside the hotel to authorized City representatives and any organization assisting employees in the hospitality industry. Such access may be used solely for the purpose of monitoring compliance with this chapter and investigating employee complaints of noncompliance. This access shall include the right of City representatives to inspect and copy payroll records, which information shall be used solely for the purpose of enforcing this article.

(h)    If any provision or application of this chapter is declared illegal, invalid or inoperative, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall remain in full force or effect. The courts are hereby authorized to reform the provisions of this chapter in order to preserve the maximum permissible effect thereof.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 08-005, eff. Sep. 18, 2008)


5-32.1.5 Findings.

The people of the City of Emeryville believe it is proper to regulate employment conditions at large hotels first rather than trying to regulate all employers because they believe that (a) large hotels are better able to afford the proposed conditions than other kinds of employers; (b) many large hotels in the Bay Area are already meeting the employment conditions required by this article, unlike the situation in other industries; (c) large hotels provide jobs similar to the janitorial jobs already protected by a similar State law on worker retention, Labor Code Sections 1060 through 1065; and (d) large hotels are generally less likely to respond to such regulation by closing or reducing employment than other kinds of businesses, which can more readily move jobs offshore or to other locations, as large hotels wish to be here because of our City’s location. Each of these factors alone is sufficient to warrant adoption of this article.

5-33.02 Findings.

The City Council finds that the proliferation of news and advertising publications intended for public distribution and the corresponding increase in the number of individual newsrack dispensers placed upon the public rights-of-way has contributed to the following:

(a)    Obstruction of traffic views;

(b)    Damage to light standards, poles, trees and sidewalks from improper placement;

(c)    Detracting from the appearance of the public streets and grounds;

(d)    Blocking access to public facilities;

5-33.03 Purpose.

This chapter seeks to provide a means to control the unregulated placement of individual newsrack dispensers in the City of Emeryville. The purpose of these regulations is to acknowledge and achieve the following:

(a)    There is a substantial government interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience by ensuring that persons may reasonably use the public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way, and other public property without interference with such use.

(b)    Newsracks placed and maintained on the streets, sidewalks, or other public rights-of-way, absent some reasonable regulation, may unreasonably interfere with the use of such streets, sidewalks, or other public rights-of-way, and may present hazards to persons or property.

(c)    The streets, sidewalks, or other public rights-of-way are historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and other publications, and access to and use of these areas for such persons is not to be denied except where such use unreasonably interferes with the use of the areas by pedestrians or traffic, or where such use presents a hazard to persons or property.

(d)    Reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this chapter which regulates the placement and maintenance of newsracks.

(e)    The public health, safety, welfare, and convenience require that:

(1)    Interference with vehicular, bicycle, assistive mobility devices or pedestrian traffic be avoided within the public rights-of-way and on commercial properties;

(2)    Obstruction of sight distance and views of traffic signs and street-crossing pedestrians be eliminated;

(3)    Damage done to sidewalks or streets be minimized and repaired;

(4)    The good appearance of the public streets and grounds be maintained;

(5)    Trees and other landscaping be allowed to grow without disturbance;

(6)    Access to emergency and other public facilities be maintained; and

(7)    Ingress and egress from properties adjoining the public rights-of-way be protected.

(f)    The regulation of the sale or free distribution of newspapers and other publications dispensed in vending machines as set forth in this chapter provides the least intrusive and burdensome means for ensuring that the purposes stated in this section are carried out while still providing ample opportunities for the distribution of news to the citizens of the City of Emeryville.

(g)    These regulations shall serve as guidelines for the installation and maintenance of newsracks on private property.

(4)    This section shall be satisfied and no accrual or carryover is required if the full amount of paid sick leave is provided to employees at the beginning of each year of employment, calendar year, or twelve (12) month period.

The employee may use all or any percentage of his or her paid sick leave to aid or care for the aforementioned persons. The opportunity to make such a designation shall be extended by the employer to the employee no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which the employee begins to accrue paid sick leave pursuant to this chapter. There shall be a window of fourteen (14) calendar days for the employee to make this designation after notice from the employer. Thereafter, the opportunity to make such a designation, including the opportunity to change such a designation previously made, shall be extended by the employer to the employee on an annual basis by January 31 of each year, with a window of fourteen (14) calendar days for the employee to make the designation after notice from the employer. An employee may use paid sick leave to aid or care for a guide dog, signal dog, or service dog, as those terms are defined by the California Disabled Persons Act, Civil Code Section 54.1, of the employee, employee’s family member, or the person designated by the employee pursuant to this section.

(2)    An employer may require employees to give reasonable notification of an absence from work for which paid sick leave is or will be used.

(3)    In each year of employment, an employee may use up to the total number of paid sick leave hours accrued, subject to the maximum number of accruable paid sick leave hours, as provided in this section.

5-40.01 Purpose.

(a)    The residential landlord and tenant relations chapter of the Emeryville Municipal Code is enacted to formalize the relations between owners and managers of residential rental property in the City and the tenants who reside in those properties. By formalizing and regulating the landlord-tenant relationship, the City sets clear expectations and provides certainty for both landlords and tenants, promotes fair dealings between landlords and tenants, and recognizes the fundamental importance of residential housing and the landlord-tenant relationship to create a healthy, safe, and vibrant city. This chapter is intended to complement existing State and Federal regulation of the landlord-tenant relationship; it does not summarize or supersede any State or Federal law. The rights and obligations created by this chapter for landlords and tenants are in addition to those rights and obligations under State and Federal law.

(b)    The City Manager has the authority to issue interpretations of and regulations to implement this chapter, including regulations to develop a process in which landlords may petition the City for a complete or partial exemption from the obligations set forth in Section 5-40.04.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 16-011, eff. Apr. 1, 2017)


5-40.02 Definitions.

(a)    “Covered unit” means every residential housing unit or dwelling unit within or under the jurisdiction of the City of Emeryville except the following:

(1)    Dwelling units in hotels, motels, lodging houses, and group residential subject to Chapter 25 of Title 5 are exempt from this chapter so long as the tenant(s) in a given dwelling unit do not reside in that unit for more than thirty (30) consecutive days. Terminating a tenancy or requiring an occupant to move, or to check out and reregister before the expiration of thirty (30) days’ occupancy is prohibited if a purpose is to avoid the effects of this chapter, in accordance with California Civil Code Section 1940.1.

(2)    The entirety of a single owner-occupied residence, when the owner-occupant rents or leases two (2) or fewer bedrooms to one (1) or more lodgers, is exempt from this chapter. 

(3)    Dwelling units in nonprofit cooperatives owned, occupied, and controlled by a majority of the residents are exempt from this chapter.

(4)    Each dwelling unit where the rent is controlled, regulated, or restricted by a State or Federal government unit, agency, or authority, when the control, regulation, or restriction would preempt local regulation of landlord and tenant relations, is exempt from this chapter. This exemption includes, but is not limited to, those dwelling units restricted by a recorded encumbrance on title pursuant to the Federal low income housing tax credit program. This exemption applies unless and until such restrictions, regulations, or controls of residential rents are released or no longer preempt local regulation of the landlord and tenant relationship; this exemption does not apply whenever a dwelling unit may be leased or rented for fair market value.

(5)    Housing accommodations in any nonprofit hospital, convent, monastery, extended care facility, asylum, residential care or adult day health care facility for the elderly which must be operated pursuant to a license issued by the California Department of Social Services are exempt from this chapter.

(6)    Housing units owned by any government unit, agency, or authority, including but not limited to any division or department of a local, State, or Federal government, are exempt from this chapter.

(b)    “Deployment” shall have the same meaning as set forth in 10 U.S.C. Section 991(b) and as may be amended.

(c)    “Group residential” shall have the same meaning as set forth in Section 9-2.211 and as may be amended. 

(d)    “Landlord” means an owner, lessor, or sublessor who receives or is entitled to receive rent for the use and occupancy of any resident rental unit or portion thereof, and includes any legal entity or other individuals, employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors that comprise or represent the landlord.

(1)    “Large landlord” means a landlord of more than four (4) covered units in the City of Emeryville.

(2)    “Small landlord” means a landlord of four (4) or fewer covered units in the City of Emeryville.

(e)    “Lodger” means a person contracting with the owner of a dwelling unit for a room or room and board within the dwelling unit personally occupied by the owner, where the owner retains a right of access to all areas of the dwelling unit occupied by the lodger and has overall control of the dwelling unit, as defined in California Civil Code Section 1946.5(c).

(f)    “Notice of termination” means a written notice that includes all of the components identified in Section 5-40.08.

(g)    “Owner-occupied residence” means a single dwelling unit in which an individual retains no less than a fifty percent (50%) ownership interest in the individual unit, and resides in that unit as his or her permanent residence no less than ten (10) months of any calendar year.

(h)    “Relocation assistance” shall have the meaning described in Section 5-40.04.

(i)    “Right to return” means the obligation of certain residential landlords to deliver, and the right of certain residential tenants to receive, an offer to return to and rent a covered unit when the landlord returns the unit to the rental market, after temporarily removing the unit from the market under Section 5-40.03(e)(2). Tenant(s) with tenancies terminated pursuant to Section 5-40.03(e)(2) are entitled to receive, and landlord(s) must deliver, an offer to return to and rent the same unit if: (1) the tenant has provided to the landlord a current mailing address at which to receive an offer of the right to return; (2) the landlord returns the covered unit to the rental market within two (2) years of terminating the tenancy under Section 5-40.03(e)(2); and (3) the tenant delivers to the landlord an affirmative written acceptance of the offer to return to and rent the unit within thirty (30) days of delivery by the landlord of the offer to return. For purposes of this subsection, “deliver” and “delivery” include deposit with the United States Postal Service of a sealed, addressed envelope, with first-class postage paid. A tenant’s right to return survives regardless of any transfer of legal ownership of the covered unit.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 16-011, eff. Apr. 1, 2017)


5-40.03 Just Cause for Termination of Tenancy Initiated by Landlord.

No landlord may terminate a residential tenancy of a covered unit unless the landlord can demonstrate:

(a)    That the landlord possesses a valid residential landlord business license pursuant to Chapter 1 of Title 3;

(b)    That the landlord has provided the tenant with a notice of tenant rights in accordance with Section 5-40.07;

(c)    That the landlord served a notice of termination to the tenant in the form required by Section 5-40.08, and that the landlord delivers a true and accurate copy of the notice of termination to the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar days of delivery to the tenant(s); and

(d)    That the landlord has not accepted and will not accept rent or any other consideration in return for the continued use of the covered unit beyond the term of the terminated tenancy in compliance with California Civil Code Sections 1945, 1946, and 1946.1.

(e)    That the termination qualifies as a for cause or no fault termination, as defined below.

(1)    For Cause Terminations. If a landlord can show any of the following circumstances with respect to a termination of tenancy, the termination will qualify as for cause.

(i)    Failure to Pay Rent. Tenant failed to pay rent within three (3) days of receiving written notice from the landlord demanding payment in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161.2.

(ii)    Breach of Rental Contract. Tenant violated a material term of the rental agreement.

(iii)    Tenant Illegal Activities. Tenant has used the unit for an illegal purpose, including but not limited to the unlawful distribution of a controlled substance as contemplated by California Civil Code Section 3486, or the unlawful use, manufacture, or possession of weapons and ammunition as contemplated by California Civil Code Section 3485.

(iv)    Violations of Applicable Health and Safety Code. Tenant created or is maintaining a dangerous and unsanitary condition as described in the Emeryville Municipal Code or applicable Federal and State law, and that condition has not been promptly abated or repaired as contemplated by applicable law.

(v)    Failure to Allow Landlord Access. Tenant failed to allow landlord access to the unit, after receiving due notice as required by California Civil Code Section 1954.

(vi)    Tenant Rejected Written Lease Extension. Tenant failed to execute a written extension of an existing rental agreement, but only if the offered written extension is substantially and materially the same as the original rental agreement.

(vii)    Tenant Violated Occupancy Restriction. Tenant failed to abide by the long-term occupancy restrictions of the rental agreement (i.e., tenant allowed long-term occupancy of the unit by one (1) or more individuals who were not previously contemplated in the rental agreement), but only when the unapproved, long-term occupants of the unit would cause the number of persons living in the unit to exceed the total of two (2) persons per bedroom in the unit plus one (1). 

(viii)    Landlord Returning from Sabbatical to Occupy Unit. Landlord has temporarily rented or leased the entirety of a single covered unit for up to and including one (1) year, when that covered unit qualified as an owner-occupied residence during the calendar year prior to the temporary rental and the landlord intends to return to the covered unit as his or her primary residence to re-qualify the covered unit as an owner-occupied residence for the calendar year after the conclusion of the temporary rental; if the covered unit does not qualify as an owner-occupied residence following the conclusion of the temporary rental, the tenant during the temporary rental is entitled to the right to return.

(ix)    Landlord Returning from Deployment. Landlord has rented or leased the entirety of a single covered unit during the landlord’s deployment by any United States Armed Force, and once the deployment has concluded, landlord returns immediately to the covered unit as his or her residence that the landlord usually occupies for use during off-duty time. 

(x)    Landlord Condominium Conversion. Landlord is converting the covered unit(s) to a condominium in accordance with Article 7 (Residential Condominium Conversions) of Chapter 6 (Subdivisions) of Title 9 (Planning Regulations), and has provided the tenant(s) with the relocation assistance payment under Section 9-6.706.

(2)    No Fault Terminations. If a landlord can show any of the following circumstances with respect to a termination of tenancy, the termination will qualify as “no fault” and entitles the tenant to relocation assistance in accordance with Section 5-40.04 and the right to return, which includes the right to receive notice from the landlord that the unit will be returned to the rental market and the right to return to and rent the unit under substantially the same material terms as the prior rental agreement when it is placed back in service for residential rental purposes. For purposes of this section, “substantially the same material terms as the prior rental agreement” means substantially similar housing services for a monthly rent charge that may not exceed the amount paid for the last month of the tenancy, subject to any notice provided in accordance with California Civil Code Section 827.

(i)    Landlord Will Remove Unit from Market. Landlord will imminently demolish the unit or otherwise permanently remove the unit from any residential rental use or purpose.

(ii)    Landlord Will Move into Unit. Landlord, or one of landlord’s parents or children, will imminently move into and reside in the housing unit as his or her permanent residence no less than ten (10) months of any calendar year, for no less than two (2) years from the termination of tenancy.

(iii)    Unit Is Temporarily Unfit for Human Habitation. The unit must be temporarily removed from the rental market because the unit is not currently fit for human habitation, but will be repaired and returned to the rental market.

(iv)    Unit Will Be Substantially Renovated. The unit must be temporarily removed from the rental market because it will imminently become unfit for human habitation because of planned capital improvements and other necessary rehabilitation, for which the landlord currently possesses all necessary permits to imminently begin and diligently complete the permitted work in order to promptly return the unit to the rental market.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 16-011, eff. Apr. 1, 2017)


5-40.04 Relocation Assistance.

(a)    When a landlord terminates a tenancy through a no fault termination, the tenant(s) will be entitled to receive relocation assistance, unless the cause of the no fault termination was a natural disaster or other naturally occurring phenomenon beyond the control of the landlord, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood. 

(b)    Landlord may pay the relocation assistance to entitled tenants concurrent with or after delivering the notice of termination, but must deliver the relocation assistance to the tenant(s) by the last day of tenancy for which the landlord has received rent.

(c)    A large landlord shall pay relocation assistance to the tenant(s), which is equivalent to either five (5) times the most current fair market rents as published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the Oakland-Fremont, California HUD Metro FMR Area in the Federal Register, or four (4) times the monthly rent that the tenant(s) is paying at the time the notice of termination is delivered, whichever amount is greater. The payment must be divided equally among all tenants who are occupying the rental unit at the time the notice of termination is delivered to the tenant(s). 

(d)    A small landlord shall pay relocation assistance to the tenant(s), which is equivalent to either one (1) month of the most current fair market rents as published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the Oakland-Fremont, California HUD Metro FMR Area in the Federal Register, or one (1) month of rent that the tenant(s) is paying at the time the notice of termination is delivered, whichever amount is greater. The payment must be divided equally among all tenants who are occupying the rental unit at the time the notice of termination is delivered to the tenant(s).

(e)    A landlord of group residential covered units shall be exempt from paying any relocation assistance. 

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 16-011, eff. Apr. 1, 2017)


5-40.05 Anti-Harassment and Other Prohibited Activities.

(a)    No landlord may do any of the following in bad faith, with ulterior motive, or without honest intent:

(1)    Interrupt, fail to provide, or threaten to interrupt or fail to provide any housing services under the rental agreement, including but not limited to utility services and other amenities and services agreed to by contract;

5-40.06 Civil Remedies.

(a)    Whenever a landlord attempts to prevent a tenant from acquiring any rights under this chapter, retaliates against a tenant for the exercise of any rights under this chapter, or engages in activities prohibited under this chapter, the tenant or the City may institute a civil proceeding for money damages or injunctive relief or both. This section creates a private right of action to enforce all terms, rights, and obligations under this chapter.

(b)    Any tenant who receives a notice of termination may bring a civil action against the landlord to contest the validity of each necessary component and pre-condition for service of the notice of termination as required by Sections 5-40.03(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and to request injunctive relief to halt the termination of tenancy. 

(1)    A landlord’s inability to demonstrate compliance with any individual component of or pre-condition to serve a notice of termination as defined in Sections 5-40.03(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) will invalidate, nullify, and avoid the effect of a notice of termination, except that a failure to demonstrate service to the City under Section 5-40.03(c) will not invalidate the notice of termination. If a notice of termination is invalidated, the tenant(s) will be entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred to invalidate the notice of termination.

(2)    If a landlord can demonstrate compliance with each pre-condition to serve the notice of termination to the tenant(s) by a preponderance of the evidence, the notice of termination will be deemed valid and the landlord entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred to defend the notice of termination.

(c)    Any tenant may bring a civil action to determine the applicability of this chapter to the tenancy, including but not limited to a determination of whether the dwelling unit is a covered unit or whether the residence qualifies as an owner-occupied residence. 

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 16-011, eff. Apr. 1, 2017)


5-40.07 Notice of Tenant Rights.

(a)    Landlords must provide to each tenant in a covered unit a notice of tenant rights under this chapter in substantially the same form as follows:

	City of Emeryville Notice 	EMC § 5-40.07

	The City of Emeryville regulates the relationship between most landlords and tenants within the City. Generally, landlords may not terminate your tenancy without cause or explanation, and may not reduce or stop providing services agreed to in the rental contract, so long as you pay rent on time as agreed in the rental contract.

In addition to State and Federal Laws, the Residential Landlord and Tenant Relations chapter of the Emeryville Municipal Code creates certain rights for landlords and tenants, which may include the right to relocation assistance or the right to return to your rental unit if you are evicted. Visit the City of Emeryville website for more information:

http://www.emeryville.org

	California Civil Code § 1946 Notice

State law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the tenant, subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general, these costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out.

(c)    Landlords must provide a copy of the notice of termination to the City Clerk within ten (10) days of delivery to the tenant(s). Landlords must attach a copy of the applicable rental agreement or contract to the notice of termination when submitting the notice of termination to the City Clerk. Notices of termination with a copy of the applicable rental agreement or contract may be mailed or otherwise delivered to:

(3)    If the owner or person in control of the dog or other animal subject to the investigation is absent or otherwise refuses to cooperate with the investigation, then the Animal Control Officer and/or the Police Officer shall so certify in writing to the Police Chief.

The owner or person in control of the animal must isolate the dog or other animal by:

(1)    Securing the dog or other animal upon the property of the owner or person in control of the animal in such a way as to ensure the protection of persons and domesticated animals from the dog or other animal; or by

(2)    A Police Officer or Animal Control Officer is hereby deemed authorized to enter onto private property for the exclusive purpose of summarily seizing and impounding a dog or other animal when directed to do so by the Chief of Police consistent with the terms of this section.

(3)    All impoundment costs are to be assessed to the owner or person in control of the dog or other animal in a manner consistent with that established in Section 6-1.107(n).

(i)    Duty to Inquire. Any person who owns or controls a dog or other animal has a duty to make inquiry of the Emeryville Police Department or other appropriate County agency to learn if the dog or other animal has been impounded, whenever a dog is known to have been missing from the person’s property for more than two (2) hours and that person has not received notice subject to Section 6-1.107(j).

(j)    Notice of Summary Impoundment.

(1)    Whenever the owner or person controlling a dog or other animal is not present at the time a dog or other animal is summarily seized and impounded, the seizing Police Officer and/or Animal Control Officer shall post a notice of impoundment on the front door or other appropriate place at the residence of such person, which notice shall state:

(i)    That the dog or other animal has been impounded;

(ii)    Where the dog or other animal is being held;

(iii)    The name, address, and telephone number of the agency or person to be contacted regarding release of the dog or other animal;

Such a request must be received by the Police Department within seventy-two (72) hours of the seizure.

(2)    The seventy two (72) hour period does not include any day that the impounding facility is closed to the public.

(3)    If no request is made by the owner or controller of the dog or other animal within seventy two (72) hours, the dog or other animal may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in accordance with law.

(4)    Upon the scheduling of a vicious animal determination hearing, the Chief of Police may order the release of the impounded dog or other animal, so long as the owner or person in control of the animal agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 6-1.107(g).

(l)    Vicious Animal Determination Hearing – Notice to Owner.

(1)    The Police Department shall deliver notice of the vicious animal determination hearing by mail to the owner or person who has an apparent right to control the dog or other animal at the place where the dog or other animal is kept or maintained, at least seven (7) days prior to the date set for a hearing.

(2)    As an alternative to sending such notice by mail, the Police Department may either deliver a copy of the notice by personal service to an adult at the address where the animal is kept and maintained or post such notice prominently at that address at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing.

(3)    In the event that the owner of the property on which the animal is kept and maintained is listed in the real property records as residing elsewhere, a copy of the notice shall also be mailed to the record owner of the property at the other address in the same manner as if she or he were the owner of the animal.

(4)    The notice shall be in substantially the following form:

Dated: _______________________

By: __________________________

Chief of Police

(m)    Vicious Animal Determination Hearing Procedure.

(1)    A Hearing Officer appointed by the Chief of Police shall preside at the vicious animal determination hearing. At the hearing both oral and documentary evidence shall be taken and considered by the Hearing Officer bearing upon the question of whether the dog or other animal is vicious under subsections (b) through (f) of Section 6-1.107. The dog or animal owner or person who has a right to control the dog or animal and the Animal Control Officer, Police Officers, or Chief of Police may be represented by counsel, may present evidence, and may cross-examine witnesses. Strict rules of evidence shall not apply. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.

(2)    Once the Animal Control Officer, Police Officer, or Chief of Police have presented evidence of the dog or other animal’s viciousness, the burden of going forward shifts to the owner or person in control of the dog or other animal to rebut the presumption as specified in Section 6-1.107(c).

(3)    At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, the hearing may be continued. No hearing shall be continued without the owner or person in control of the animal providing proof to the Hearing Officer that the animal will continue to be isolated in a manner consistent with that established under Section 6-1.107(g).

(4)    If the Hearing Officer finds that the dog or other animal is vicious, he shall so specify in writing together with particular findings of fact. Any animal found to be vicious shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and shall be, pursuant to the order of the Hearing Officer, destroyed, removed from the City, or otherwise abated.

(5)    The decision of the Hearing Officer may be appealed by any interested party to the Superior Court. In order to facilitate the appeal, the Hearing Officer shall stay the effect of his or her decision upon request for up to fifteen (15) days, provided that the person owning or controlling the dog or other animal demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Hearing Officer that the dog or other animal will continue to be isolated or impounded and a bond in the amount of the per diem cost of impoundment is paid.

(n)    Cost of Abatement Paid by Owner.

(1)    The cost of abating a vicious dog or other animal shall be paid by the owner or person in control of the dog or other animal and shall become a lien against the property upon which the animal is kept and maintained until said assessment is paid.

(2)    The assessment shall be paid on or before the 15th day of July following its imposition. If the assessment is not paid on or before that date, the total amount due shall be entered as a lien against the property of the owner of the property where the dog or other animal was maintained and shall be subject to the same penalties as are provided for other delinquent assessments as provided in Sections 6-2.10 and 6-2.11 of the Emeryville Municipal Code.

(3)    In the event that legal action is necessary to collect said assessment, the owner or controller of the dog or other animal shall pay all the expenses thereof including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the City.

(e)    Any person to whom the City Manger issues a notice of violation or an administrative civil liability citation may request an administrative hearing to appeal such warning or determination of liability by filing a written request with the City Manager or his/her designee.

7-8.413 Wastewater Volume Determination: Metered Water Supply.

When charges and fees are based upon the water usage, such charges and fees shall be applied against the total amount of water used from all sources unless, in the opinion of the Director, significant portions of water received are not discharged to a public sewer. The total amount of water used from public and private sources will be determined by means of public meters or private meters, installed and maintained at the expense of the user and as approved by the Director.

(Sec. 3, Ord. 82-013, eff. Nov. 25, 1982; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 11-004, eff. June 2, 2011. Formerly 7-8.312)


7-8.414 Metered Wastewater Volume and Metered Diversions.

When charges and fees are based upon water usage and when, in the opinion of the Director, a significant portion of the water received from any metered source does not flow into the public sewer because of the principal activity of the user or removal by other means, the user charges and fees will be applied against the volume of water discharged from such premises into the public sewer. Written notification and proof of the diversion of water must be provided by the user and approved by the City if the user is to avoid the application of the charges and fees against the total amount of water used from all sources. The user may install a meter of a type and at a location approved by the Director and at the user’s expense. Such meters shall measure either the amount of sewage discharged or the amount of water diverted. Such meters shall be maintained at the expense of the user and be tested for accuracy at the expense of the user when deemed necessary by the Director. For users who, in the opinion of the Director, divert a significant portion of their flow from a public sewer, the charges and fees may be based upon measurement of the flow and volume to be discharged, prepared by the user and approved by the Director. The measurement must include the method, calculations and type of equipment used to determine the wastewater volume.

(Sec. 3, Ord. 82-013, eff. Nov. 25, 1982; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 11-004, eff. June 2, 2011. Formerly 7-8.313)

7-10.05 Planting and Removal of Street Trees.

(a)    Encroachment Permit Required – Planting. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant a street tree without a valid encroachment permit for such work issued by the Department pursuant to Chapter 2 of this title.

(b)    Encroachment Permit Required – Removal. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any street tree without a valid tree removal permit for such work issued in accordance with this chapter and a valid encroachment permit for such work issued by the Department pursuant to Chapter 2 of this title.

(c)    Planting. An abutting property owner who desires a permit to plant a street tree shall apply to the Department as part of the encroachment permit process. The details of the planting, such as the species of street tree, soil testing, soil amending, staking, location and other details shall be approved by the Department. If approved, a permit to plant the specified species of tree(s) shall be issued to the applicant. The Department may elect to plant the street tree or permit the applicant to do so and condition any permits on the abutting property owner’s agreement to water or otherwise maintain the street tree or upon such other conditions as may be appropriate. In order to encourage the planting of street trees, the Department may, in its discretion, waive the permit fee for the planting of a street tree.

(d)    Tree Removal Permit. An abutting property owner who desires to remove a street tree shall apply to the Department for a tree removal permit. Such application must be accompanied by payment of the encroachment permit fee in accordance with the Master Fee Schedule adopted by the City.

(e)    Removal Application. An applicant requesting a tree removal permit to remove a street tree shall be required to submit a plan showing (1) the location, species, trunk diameter at four and one-half feet (4-1/2') above natural grade, canopy size, and drip line (as defined in Section 7-10.03) of all street trees to be removed, (2) a red “X” over each street tree to be removed, (3) an appraisal of the replacement value fee (as defined in Section 7-10.03) of all street trees identified in the plan to be removed, (4) a tree report prepared by a certified arborist providing accurate information and opinion regarding the location, species, trunk diameter measured at four and one half feet (4-1/2') above natural grade, canopy size, and condition of all street trees identified in the plan to be removed, and (5) such other information or details as the Department may require. Applicants for a street tree removal permit sought as a component of a development project that requires Planning Commission review or approval in accordance with Article 82 of Chapter 4 of Title 9 shall also comply with the submittal requirements set forth in Section 9-4.82.3. Further, applicants for a street tree removal permit shall also comply with the submittal requirements for an encroachment permit as set forth in Section 7-2.04.

(f)    Decision to Grant Permit. The Department shall present the application to remove a street tree to the Planning Commission at a noticed public hearing.

If the Planning Commission grants a permit for tree removal, the Planning Commission shall require the planting of replacement trees of equal or cumulative diameter to the trees approved for removal and payment of the replacement value fee of the street tree(s) to be removed. When replacement of a tree of equal diameter is not feasible, for reasons related to site-specific conditions, replacement at the largest practicable diameter, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall be required. When the replacement tree cannot match the diameter of the tree to be removed, due to site-specific conditions, the Planning Commission shall require replacement planting of several trees of equal cumulative diameter to the tree being removed. In cases where the need for street tree removal is without fault of the property owner and the property owner is not otherwise responsible for maintenance of the street tree, or for other good cause shown, the Planning Commission may waive the requirement to plant a replacement tree of equal or cumulative value or payment of a replacement value fee.

(g)    Notice Required. Upon receipt of an application for a tree removal permit for street tree removal, the Department shall post notice of the public hearing on such application on the affected street tree(s), in a manner not injurious to the tree(s); at the locations designated in Section 2-8.01 and provide Type B and D notice as set forth in Section 9-4.89.3.

8-19.19 Water Pressure, Pressure Regulators, and Pressure –Relief Valves.

In live/work occupancies where structural conditions prevent the termination of the water heater pressure and temperature relief valve at the exterior of the building, these valves may terminate at a floor drain, a floor sink, a work or utility sink. They may not terminate at a toilet, lavatory, shower, bathtub or kitchen sink.

If the floor beneath the water heater is concrete and if the water heater is installed on top of a metal pan manufactured and listed for this use, the relief valve may terminate between six inches (6") and twelve inches (12") above this pan. When installed in this fashion, an additional pressure-relief valve must be installed in the water line. This valve must contain an integral bypass valve which permits the relief of excessive pressure via the supply main. In lieu of such a valve, an approved and listed expansion tank must be installed.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

(h)    Area of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area.”

(i)    “Base flood” means a flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “one hundred (100) year flood”). “Base flood” is the term used throughout this chapter.

(j)    “Base flood elevation (BFE)” means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

(l)    “Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

(1)    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

(2)    The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

(m)    Building. See “Structure.”

(n)    “Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zone VI-V30, VE, or V.

(o)    “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

(p)    “Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

(q)    “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 3, 2009.

(r)    “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(s)    “Flood, flooding, or flood water” means:

(1)    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

(2)    The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

(t)    “Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

(u)    “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

(v)    “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

(w)    “Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See “Flooding.”

(z)    “Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of the police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

(aa)    “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

(bb)    “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1'). Also referred to as “Regulatory floodway.”

(cc)    “Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

(dd)    “Fraud and victimization” as related to Section 8-21.09 means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

(ee)    “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

(ff)    “Governing body” is the City of Emeryville that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

(gg)    “Hardship” as related to Section 8-21.09 means an exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The governing body requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

(hh)    “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

(ii)    “Historic structure” means any structure that is:

(1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

(3)    Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

(4)    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

(jj)    “Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

(kk)    “Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

(ll)    “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement”).

(1)    An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

(i)    The flood openings standard in Section 8-21.04(c);

(ii)    The anchoring standards in Section 8-21.04(a);

(iii)    The construction materials and methods standards in Section 8-21.04(b); and

(iv)    The standards for utilities in Section 8-21.05.

(2)    For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “Basement”). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

(mm)    “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

(nn)    “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

(oo)    “Market value” is defined in the City of Emeryville substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 8-21.03(b)(2)(i).

(pp)    “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

(qq)    “New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after August 3, 2009, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

(rr)    “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 3, 2009.

(ss)    “Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

(tt)    One Hundred (100) Year Flood. See “Base flood.”

(uu)    “Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms.

(eee)    “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

(fff)    “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

(hhh)    “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

(1)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(2)    Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

(iii)    V Zone. See “Coastal high hazard area.”

(jjj)    “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

(kkk)    “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(lll)    “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

8-21.02 General Provisions.

(a)    Applicable Areas. This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the City of Emeryville. The City of Emeryville is located in two (2) Zones: Zone V and Zone X. Zone V, the coastal high hazard area, only includes City coastal and tideland areas, according to the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) effective August 3, 2009, on file with the City. The vast majority of the City’s jurisdiction lies in Zone X, which is not part of a special flood hazard area, and thus not subject to the requirements of this chapter.

(b)    Basis. The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Emeryville” effective August 3, 2009, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The FIS, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the City.

(c)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(d)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(1)    Considered as minimum requirements;

(2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.

(e)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside a special flood hazard area or uses permitted within such area will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council of the City of Emeryville, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 09-003, eff. July 16, 2009; Sec. 4 (part), Ord. 16-008, eff. Jan. 1, 2017. Formerly 8-20.02)


8-21.03 Administration.

(a)    Floodplain Administrator. The City Manager or his or her designee is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.

(b)    Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(1)    Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

(i)    Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

(ii)    All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained;

(iii)    The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

(iv)    The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the City; and

(v)    All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

(2)    Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

(i)    Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

(ii)    Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments and implemented by City staff.

(3)    Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 8-21.02(b), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer this chapter. A base flood elevation may be obtained using one (1) of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas — A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.

(4)    Notification of Other Agencies.

(i)    Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.

(A)    Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

8-21.09 Variance Procedure.

(a)    Nature of Variance. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the City of Emeryville to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

(b)    Conditions for Variances.

(1)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(2)    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Section 8-21.01(ii)) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(3)    Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(4)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary,” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City of Emeryville need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City of Emeryville believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter.

(5)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that:

(i)    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and

(ii)    Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Alameda County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

(6)    The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(c)    Appeal Board.

(1)    In passing upon requests for variances, the City of Emeryville shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

(i)    Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(ii)    Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(iii)    Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

(iv)    Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(v)    Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(vi)    Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(vii)    Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(viii)    Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(ix)    Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(x)    Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

(xi)    Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

(2)    Variances shall only be issued upon a:

(i)    Showing of good and sufficient cause;

(ii)    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and

(iii)    Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance,” Section 8-21.01(ww)), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(3)    Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections (c)(1) through (4) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

(4)    Upon consideration of the factors and the purposes of this chapter, the City of Emeryville may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

8-21.10 Appeal.

(a)    Any applicant or person may appeal to the City Manager the determination of the Floodplain Administrator regarding compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    Any appeal to the City Manager must be filed in writing with the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar days of the determination by the Floodplain Administrator. The appeal shall state with reasonable particularity and specificity the alleged error or basis for appeal and be supplemented with all supporting documentation the appellant desires the City Manager to consider. The City Manager may request additional written or oral information from the applicant or the Floodplain Administrator. The City Manager shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the appeal.

(c)    The determination of the City Manager may be appealed to the City Council in accordance with Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Emeryville Municipal Code.

8-26.06 Exemption for Infeasibility.

(a)    Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the WMP required under Section 8-26.03. The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.

(b)    Meeting with WMP Compliance Official. The WMP compliance official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Upon request, the WMP compliance official may request that staff from the Alameda County Waste Management Authority attend this meeting or may require the applicant to request a separate meeting with Alameda County Waste Management Authority staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, Alameda County Waste Management Authority staff, the WMP compliance official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement.

(c)    Granting of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant of a covered project to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the applicant. The WMP compliance official shall return a copy of the WMP to the applicant marked “approved for infeasible exemption” and shall notify the Building Department that the WMP has been approved.

(d)    Denial of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days to resubmit a WMP form in full compliance with Section 8-26.03. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMP, or if the resubmitted WMP does not comply with Section 8-26.03, the WMP compliance official shall deny the WMP in accordance with Section 8-26.04 or 8-26.05.

(Sec. 2 (part), Ord. 17-011, eff. Nov. 2, 2017)

9-3.104 Interpretation of Zoning Maps.

(a)    Zoning Districts Include Streets and Rights-of-Way. Where no zoning district is indicated on a public or private street or other right-of-way on the Zoning Map in Figure 9-3.103(a), the street or right-of-way shall be deemed to be included in the same zoning district as the closest abutting lot. If lots on opposite sides of the street or right-of-way are in the same zoning district, the street between them shall be deemed to be in that zoning district. If lots on opposite sides of the street or right-of-way are in different zoning districts, the zoning districts on each side of the street or right-of-way shall be deemed to extend to the centerline of the street or right-of-way.

(b)    Lots Split by Zone Boundaries. If a lot is in two (2) or more base zones on the Zoning Map in Figure 9-3.103(a), the zones indicated on the map shall apply to each portion of the lot, except that the entire lot may be deemed to be in one (1) of the zones shown on the map upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Such a conditional use permit may be granted only if both of the following conditions are met:

(1)    At least fifty percent (50%) of the lot area is already covered by the zone in question; and

(2)    The entire lot could be included in said zone by shifting the zone boundary by not more than fifty feet (50') as measured perpendicularly to said boundary at any point.

(c)    PUDs and Overlay Zones. PUDs established prior to the adoption of these regulations are not subject to the provisions of the overlay zones indicated on the Zoning Overlay Map in Figure 9-3.103(b). PUDs established following the adoption of these regulations are subject to the provisions of the overlay zones indicated on the Zoning Overlay Map in Figure 9-3.103(b).

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)

See Chapter 5 for additional use and development regulations that apply in two (2) or more zoning districts.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)

Article 2.    Uses Permitted, Conditionally Permitted, and Prohibited


9-3.201 Purpose.

The purpose of this article is to establish use regulations in the base and overlay zones, except in PUDs and the NH and PP overlay zones. Uses in PUDs are established in the relevant ordinances for each PUD; the NH and PP overlay zones do not include use regulations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-3.202 Uses Permitted, Conditionally Permitted and Prohibited.

Uses, as classified in Chapter 2 of this title, are permitted, conditionally permitted, or prohibited in base and overlay zones as indicated in Table 9-3.202. Uses not classified in Chapter 2 of this title are prohibited. The regulations for each use in each zone are established by letter designations as follows:

“P” designates a permitted use.

“C” designates a conditionally permitted use normally requiring a major conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in Article 5 of Chapter 7, such uses may require a minor conditional use permit.

“CM” designates a conditionally permitted use normally requiring a minor conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in Article 5 of Chapter 7, such uses may require a major conditional use permit.

“T” designates a temporary use requiring a temporary use permit pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 7.

“X” designates a prohibited use.

Conditionally permitted uses are subject to the required findings in Article 5 of Chapter 7 and any additional findings for the zone that may be required by Articles 3 and 4 this chapter. Temporary uses are subject to the required findings in Article 6 of Chapter 7 and any additional findings for the zone that may be required by Articles 3 and 4 this chapter.

Use regulations in the overlay zones supersede those of the base zones. Where the indication in an overlay zone for a particular use is blank, the regulation of the base zone for that use is unchanged.

References to zone regulations applicable to specific uses are indicated by footnotes.

9-4.201 Building Intensity (Floor Area Ratio).

(a)    Maximum Building Intensity (Floor Area Ratio). The maximum intensity of buildings, expressed as a maximum floor area ratio (FAR), shall be as prescribed on the General Plan Floor Area Ratio Map (General Plan Figure 2-3, entitled “Maximum Floor Area Ratios”), which is made a part of these regulations by this reference and is shown in Figure 9-4.201(a). The floor area ratio districts are delineated by numbers on this map and the corresponding limits for the maximum permitted FAR and bonus FAR that may be granted under Section 9-4.204 are as shown in Table 9-4.201(a):

Table 9-4.201(a): 

Maximum Floor Area Ratio  

	 	Maximum Permitted Building Intensity (FAR)

	Map Designation	Base	Bonus

	0.5/1.0	Up to 0.5	Up to 1.0

	1.0	Up to 1.0	None

	1.0/1.6	Up to 1.0	Up to 1.6

	1.5/3.0	Up to 1.5	Up to 3.0

	2.0/4.0	Up to 2.0	Up to 4.0

	3.0/6.0	Up to 3.0	Up to 6.0

(b)    Determining Floor Area Ratio. The floor area ratio (FAR) is the ratio of the floor area of all principal buildings on a lot to the lot area, rounded to the nearest tenth in accordance with Section 9-1.203(b). Examples of floor area ratio are shown in Figure 9-4.201(b). Note that floor area, as defined in Chapter 8, does not include parking or loading areas.

(c)    Interpretation of Floor Area Ratio Map. If a lot is in two (2) or more floor area ratio districts on the General Plan Floor Area Ratio Map, the floor area ratio indicated on the map shall apply to each portion of the lot, except that the floor area ratio for the entire lot may be increased up to the maximum floor area ratio applicable to any portion of the lot upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Such a conditional use permit may be granted only if both of the following conditions are met:

(1)    At least fifty percent (50%) of the lot area is already covered by the district with the maximum floor area ratio; and

(2)    The entire lot could be included in said district by shifting the floor area ratio district boundary by not more than fifty feet (50') as measured perpendicularly to said boundary at any point.

If subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply, the maximum permissible floor area for the lot shall be calculated based on the floor area ratios that apply to each portion of the lot. However, the resulting floor area may be located anywhere on the lot, subject to applicable height limits, setbacks, and any other dimensional requirements for each portion of the lot.

Figure 9-4.202(a): Maximum Building Heights.

(b)    Measuring Height.

(1)    Buildings. Building height is measured from the average level of the highest and lowest points of finished grade surrounding the building to the highest point of the roof, not including parapets. The height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the building.

(2)    Other Structures. The height of other structures is the vertical distance from the average ground level immediately under the structure to the top of the structure, with the following special provisions for fences and decks, as illustrated in Figure 9-4.202(b):

a.    Fences on Retaining Walls. The height of a fence that is on top of a retaining wall is measured from the ground level on the highest side of the fence and wall. See also Section 9-4.505(c).

b.    Decks and Balconies. Deck and balcony height is determined by measuring from the ground adjacent to the building to which the deck or balcony is attached to the top of the floor of the deck or balcony.


[IMAGE]


Figure 9-4.202(b): Measuring Height of Decks, Balconies, and Fences.

(c)    Allowed Projections above Top of Building.

(1)    Allowed Projections. The height limits for the various height districts do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, or other architectural projections not used for human habitation, nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights, parapet walls, cornices, solar energy systems, mechanical equipment, or other appurtenances usually located on the roof level; provided, that such features are limited to the height necessary for their proper functioning.

(2)    Height of Projections. Except for parapet walls, such features may project up to fifteen feet (15') above the roof of the building in the thirty-foot (30') height district, and up to twenty-five feet (25') above the roof of the building in all other height districts. Parapet walls may extend up to three feet (3') above the roof of the building in the thirty-foot (30') height district, and up to five feet (5') above the roof of the building in all other height districts.

(3)    Coverage of Projections. Except as provided in subsection (c)(4) of this section, all of the above mentioned features which project more than five feet (5') above the roof of the building shall be limited to a maximum aggregate coverage of ten percent (10%) of the building’s horizontal roof area. For projections of five feet (5') or less, including parapet walls, there is no limitation on coverage. Rooftop equipment shall be set back from the edge of the roof to the maximum extent feasible to minimize visibility from below and shall be screened as required by Section 9-4.507. Architectural features that are intended to be visible need not be set back from the edge of the roof or screened.

(4)    Mechanical Penthouses. Allowed projections that are completely enclosed in a mechanical penthouse shall be limited to a maximum aggregate coverage of twenty percent (20%) of the building’s horizontal roof area. Such penthouses shall be compatible with the architectural design of the building; shall be completely roofed except for cooling towers and any other equipment that cannot properly function if roofed; and are eligible for development bonuses pursuant to item (17) in Table 9-4.204(c).

(5)    Exceeding Height and Coverage Limits. The limits listed in this section, related to both projection height and horizontal area coverage, may be exceeded upon the granting of a minor conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7.

(6)    Solar Panels. The limitations set forth in this section do not apply to solar panels.

(d)    Interpretation of Height Map. If a lot is in two (2) or more height districts on the General Plan Height Map, the height limit indicated on the map shall apply to each portion of the lot, except that the height limit for the entire lot may be increased up to the maximum height limit applicable to any portion of the lot upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Such a conditional use permit may be granted only if both of the following conditions are met:

(1)    At least fifty percent (50%) of the lot area is already covered by the district with the maximum height limit; and

(2)    The entire lot could be included in said district by shifting the height district boundary by not more than fifty feet (50') as measured perpendicularly to said boundary at any point.

If subsections (d)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply, the maximum height for each portion of the lot shall be as indicated on the General Plan Height Map; provided, that the height limit shall step down from higher height limits to lower height limits as required by subsection (e) of this section.

(e)    Height Limits Adjacent to Lower Height Districts. Where a height district abuts a lower height district, the maximum permitted height shall step down at a forty-five (45) degree angle, as measured perpendicular to the boundary between the height districts, to the bonus height of the adjacent height district at the height district boundary, or, if the adjacent height district has no bonus height, to the base height of the adjacent height district at the height district boundary, as illustrated in Figure 9-4.202(e). This regulation does not apply where different height districts are on opposite sides of a public street or railroad right-of-way, nor in the one hundred plus (100+) height district, which has no absolute bonus height.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 4 (part), Ord. 15-009, eff. Dec. 3, 2015; Sec. 4 (part), Ord. 18-005, eff. Dec. 13, 2018; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 19-009, eff. Aug. 22, 2019)


9-4.203 Residential Density.

(a)    Maximum Residential Density. The maximum density of residential uses, expressed as units per acre, shall be as prescribed on the General Plan Residential Density Map (General Plan Figure 2-6, entitled “Maximum Residential Densities”), which is made a part of these regulations by this reference and is shown in Figure 9-4.203(a). The residential density districts are delineated by numbers on this map and the corresponding limits for the maximum permitted residential density and bonus residential density that may be granted under Section 9-4.204 are as shown in Table 9-4.203(a):

Table 9-4.203(a): Maximum Residential Density 

	 	Maximum Permitted Residential Density (Units per Acre)

	Map Designation	Base	Bonus

	20/35	Up to 20 units per acre	Up to 35

 units per acre	35/60	Up to 35 units per acre	Up to 60

 units per acre	50/100	Up to 50 units per acre	Up to 100

 units per acre	70/135	Up to 70 units per acre	Up to 135

 units per acre	85/170	Up to 85 units per acre	Up to 170

 units per acre    Determining Residential Density. The residential density is the ratio of the number of dwelling units on a lot to the lot area in acres, rounded to the nearest whole number in accordance with Section 9-1.203(a). (One (1) acre equals forty-three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet.)

(c)    Interpretation of Residential Density Map. If a lot is in two (2) or more residential density districts on the General Plan Residential Density Map, the residential density indicated on the map shall apply to each portion of the lot, except that the residential density for the entire lot may be increased up to the maximum residential density applicable to any portion of the lot upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7. Such a conditional use permit may be granted only if both of the following conditions are met:

(1)    At least fifty percent (50%) of the lot area is already covered by the district with the maximum residential density; and

(2)    The entire lot could be included in said district by shifting the residential density district boundary by not more than fifty feet (50') as measured perpendicularly to said boundary at any point.

If subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply, the maximum permissible residential density for the lot shall be calculated based on the residential densities that apply to each portion of the lot. However, the resulting dwelling units may be located anywhere on the lot, subject to applicable height limits, setbacks, and any other dimensional requirements for each portion of the lot.

9-4.204 Development Bonuses.

(a)    State Density Bonus Not Available. If a developer chooses to request development bonuses pursuant to the provisions of this section, density bonuses pursuant to the State density bonus requirements in Article 5 of Chapter 5 are not available.

(b)    Procedure. Bonus floor area ratio, height, and/or residential density, as specified in this article, may be permitted upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 7 and the additional findings required by subsection (f) of this section. Projects seeking bonus points for the flexible community benefit pursuant to item (7) in Table 9-4.204(e) shall require approval of a conditional use permit by the City Council upon a recommendation of the Planning Commission. For planned unit developments, development bonuses shall comply with the requirements of this section, but shall not require a conditional use permit and shall be considered as part of the PUD approval process pursuant to Article 10 of Chapter 7.

(1)    RM Medium Density Residential Zone.

a.    Multi-unit residential projects of ten (10) units or more must provide affordable units and community benefits as specified in this section. The findings in subsections (f)(1) and (2) of this section must be made.

b.    For all other projects, community benefits are not required. The findings in subsection (f)(1) of this section must be made.

(2)    In all other zones affordable housing and other community benefits as specified in this section must be provided sufficient to earn the number of points required for the bonus amount requested, pursuant to subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section. The findings in subsection (f)(2) of this section must be made.

(3)    For bonus height over one hundred feet (100'), affordable housing and other community benefits as specified in this section must be provided sufficient to earn at least one hundred (100) points pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section. The findings in subsections (f)(2) and (3) of this section must be made.

To qualify for a bonus, a community benefit must be significant and clearly beyond what would otherwise be required for the project under applicable code provisions, conditions of approval, and/or environmental review mitigation measures.

(c)    Determination of Bonuses. Bonus floor area ratio, height, and/or residential density shall be calculated in accordance with the following procedures.

(1)    Points Required. The number of bonus points required, up to a maximum of one hundred (100), is calculated according to the following formula:

	Bonus Requested	X	100	=	Points Required

	Bonus Increment	 	 	 	 

Variables used in bonus point calculation:

a.    Bonus Requested. The amount of FAR, height, or residential density requested for the project above the base level as specified in Tables 9-4.201(a), 9-4.202(a) and 9-4.203(a), respectively.

b.    Bonus Increment. The difference between the maximum bonus amount and the maximum base amount for FAR, height, and residential density as specified in Tables 9-4.201(a), 9-4.202(a), and 9-4.203(a), respectively.

(2)    Points Count Toward All Bonuses. The points awarded for the provision of affordable housing and other community benefits pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section may be counted towards FAR, height, and residential density. It is not necessary to earn separate points for each of these bonuses.

(3)    Height over One Hundred Feet (100'). To qualify for bonus height over one hundred feet (100') in the seventy-five/one hundred plus (75/100+) height district, affordable housing and other community benefits worth at least one hundred (100) points must be provided pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section.

(4)    Modifications.

a.    Prior to Issuance of Building Permit. No community benefit for which a bonus has been granted may be eliminated or reduced in size without the approval of the Planning Commission or City Council, whichever approved the project. To grant such approval, the Commission or Council must find that there is a corresponding reduction in intensity, height, and/or density, a substitution of an equivalent community benefit, or a combination of the two.

b.    Prior to Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy. Before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a project, the applicant shall certify to the Director that the bonus points upon which the project’s floor area ratio, height, and/or residential density were based have, in fact, been achieved. If the number of bonus points achieved by the completed project is less than required, the applicant shall contribute one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of construction valuation per point of shortfall to the Citywide Parks Fund. Such contribution shall be made before a certificate of occupancy is issued.

(d)    Affordable Housing. No fewer than half of the bonus points required for the project, as calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, up to fifty (50) points, shall be earned through the provision of affordable housing as specified below. If half of the bonus points required for the project is not a multiple of five (5), it shall be rounded up to the next multiple of five (5) for the purposes of the provision of affordable housing.

(1)    Residential Projects. Multi-unit residential developments of ten (10) units or more shall provide affordable units in the development in accordance with the applicable requirements of Article 4 of Chapter 5. The number of bonus points awarded shall be determined for providing affordable units at various income levels in accordance with Table 9-4.204(d)(1) below.

Table 9-4.204(d)(1): Bonus Points for Affordable Units in Project

	50	17.0%	3.9%	5.9%	7.2%	25.0%

(2)    Nonresidential Projects. Nonresidential developments shall pay an additional affordable housing impact fee in accordance with Table 9-4.204(d)(2) below. The increase shall be based on the applicable fee in effect when the fee is due. For use types that are normally exempt from the affordable housing impact fee, the increased fee shall be based on the fee for nonexempt uses.

 

Table 9-4.204(d)(2): Bonus Points for Nonresidential Uses 

	Bonus Points Awarded	Additional Fee

	5	10%

	10	20%

	15	30%

	20	40%

	25	50%

	30	60%

	35	70%

	40	80%

	45	90%

	50	100%

For example, if the current fee for nonexempt uses were four dollars ($4.00) per square foot, to earn thirty (30) points, an additional fee of two dollars and forty cents ($2.40) per square foot would be required (sixty percent (60%) of four dollars ($4.00)) for a total of six dollars and forty cents ($6.40) per square foot. A use type that is normally exempt from the affordable housing impact fee would not pay the base fee of four dollars ($4.00) per square foot, but would pay the fee increase of two dollars and forty cents ($2.40) per square foot.

(e)    Community Benefits. No more than half of the bonuses points required for the project, as calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, may be earned through the provision of community benefits. The maximum number of points that may be awarded for each community benefit, the calculation method, and other requirements are as shown in Table 9-4.204(e):

(c)    Address the circulation and access needs of bicyclists and pedestrians by requiring bicycle parking facilities and promoting parking lot designs that offer safe and attractive pedestrian routes;

(d)    Establish standards and regulations for safe and well-designed parking, loading, and vehicle circulation areas that minimize conflicts between pedestrian and vehicles within parking lots and, where appropriate, create buffers from surrounding land uses;

(e)    Offer flexible means of minimizing the amount of land area devoted to parking of automobiles by allowing reductions in the number of required parking spaces in transit-served locations, for shared parking facilities, and for other situations expected to have lower vehicle parking demand; and

(f)    Reduce urban stormwater run-off and heat island effect.

9-4.402 Applicability.

(a)    New Development. Unless otherwise specified, the parking and loading requirements of this article apply to all new buildings and to all new conditionally permitted uses in existing buildings.

(b)    Enlargements and Expansions. Unless otherwise specified, the parking and loading requirements of this article apply whenever an existing building or use is enlarged or expanded to include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking and loading requirements for that use. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area.

(c)    Damage or Destruction. When a use that has been involuntarily damaged or destroyed is re-established, off-street parking and loading facilities must also be re-established or continued in operation in an amount equal to the number maintained at the time of such damage or destruction. It is not necessary, however, to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this article. Also see the nonconforming use regulations at Article 10 of Chapter 5.

(d)    Exceptions.

(1)    Neighborhood Retail Overlay Zone. Pursuant to Section 9-3.404(a)(4), in the NR Neighborhood Retail overlay zone local-serving uses having a gross floor area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or less are exempt from the off-street parking and loading requirements of this article.

(2)    Transit Hub Overlay Zone. Pursuant to Section 9-3.406(a)(1), in the TH Transit Hub overlay zone minimum and maximum parking requirements shall be reduced to fifty percent (50%) of the requirements set forth in this article, and minimum parking requirements may be further reduced or eliminated upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the requirements of this article and Section 9-3.406(b).

(3)    Alternative Parking Plans. If an alternative parking plan is approved pursuant to Section 9-4.407, the off-street parking requirements shall be subject to the provisions of said plan.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-4.403 General Regulations and Standards.

(a)    No Reduction in Off-Street Parking and Loading Spaces. Off-street parking and loading spaces established as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article shall not be reduced in number during the life of such building or land use below that which would be required for a new building or use of a similar type under the requirements of this article. All such off-street parking and loading spaces shall remain permanently available and accessible for the parking or loading of vehicles by occupants of the property, as intended by the requirements of this article, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to nonoccupants with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on thirty (30) days’ notice if they become needed by occupants of the property.

(b)    Separate Parking and Loading Spaces. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space. However, maneuvering aisles and driveways may serve both required parking spaces and loading spaces if they meet the requirements specified in this article for both parking and loading facilities.

(c)    Disabled Parking. Parking spaces for the disabled shall be provided as required by the building regulations in Title 8. Such spaces may be counted towards the parking requirements of this article.

(d)    Nonconforming Parking Facilities. Existing buildings whose off-street parking and loading facilities do not conform to the requirements of this article may be enlarged or expanded; provided, that additional parking and loading facilities shall be added so that the enlarged or expanded portion of the building conforms to the requirements of this article, subject to the applicable provisions for nonconforming uses and structures in Article 10 of Chapter 5.

(e)    Unbundled Parking. The following rules shall apply to the sale or rental of parking spaces in new Multi-Unit Residential Uses of ten (10) units or more:

(1)    All off-street parking spaces shall be leased or sold separately from the rental or purchase fees for dwelling units for the life of the dwelling units, such that potential renters or buyers have the option of renting or buying a residential unit at a price lower than would be the case if there were a single price for both the residential unit and the parking space(s).

(2)    In cases where there are fewer parking spaces than dwelling units, the parking spaces shall be offered first to the potential buyers or renters of three (3) bedroom or more units, second to potential buyers or renters of two (2) bedroom units, and then to potential buyers and renters of other units.

(3)    Potential buyers and renters of affordable units shall have an equal opportunity to buy or rent a parking space on the same terms and conditions as offered to potential buyers and renters of market-rate units, at a price proportional to the sale or rental price of their units as compared to comparable market-rate units. This stipulation shall be included in any agreement recorded between the City and developer pertaining to the affordable housing units pursuant to Article 4 of Chapter 5.

(4)    Parking spaces shall be offered only to residents of the dwelling units served by the off-street parking, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to nonresidents with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on thirty (30) days’ notice if they become needed by residents. Required visitor spaces shall not be rented out.

The Director may grant an exception from the requirements of this subsection for affordable units which include financing for affordable housing that requires that costs for parking and housing be bundled together.

(f)    Surface Parking Lots. Surface parking lots shall be subject to the following restrictions and standards. The area of a surface parking lot shall include all features within the lot’s outer edges, including all parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, access driveways, and perimeter and interior landscaping, walkways, and other features.

(1)    Large Parking Lots. New or expanded surface parking lots of more than two (2) acres are prohibited. Such parking facilities shall be provided within buildings or parking structures, or shall be otherwise covered by a structure that serves a nonparking function such as solar panels, recreational facilities, roof deck, or green roof.

(2)    Medium Parking Lots. New or expanded surface parking lots of greater than one-half (1/2) acre but not more than two (2) acres may be allowed with a conditional use permit. To grant such a conditional use permit, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required by Article 5 of Chapter 7:

a.    That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that it is infeasible to provide the parking within a building or parking structure, or to otherwise cover it.

b.    That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that every reasonable effort has been made to minimize the size of the parking lot.

c.    That the parking spaces comply with the requirements of this article including the design standards of Section 9-4.406.

d.    That the applicable provisions of the Emeryville Design Guidelines, including but not limited to those pertaining to parking and access, have been met.

(3)    Small Parking Lots. New or expanded surface parking lots of no more than one-half (1/2) acre are permitted subject to the requirements of this article including the design standards of Section 9-4.406.

(4)    Pedestrian Circulation. Parking lots containing fifty (50) or more spaces shall have walkways separated from motor vehicle maneuvering aisles and driveways connecting the principal building or buildings served by the lot to the farthest point of the lot from the main pedestrian entrance of such building or buildings.

a.    Materials and Width. Walkways shall provide at least four feet (4') of unobstructed width and be hard-surfaced.

b.    Identification. Pedestrian walkways shall be clearly differentiated from driveways, parking aisles, and parking and loading spaces through the use of elevation changes, different paving material, or similar method.

c.    Separation. Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, it must be raised and separated from the auto travel lane by a raised curb at least six inches (6") high, bollards, or other physical barrier.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-4.404 Calculation of Parking Requirement.

The minimum number of parking spaces required and the maximum number of parking spaces allowed shall be based on the estimated parking demand by use type as listed in Table 9-4.404. The following rules apply when calculating the estimated parking demand:

(a)    Multiple Uses. When two (2) or more principal uses are located on the same lot, the estimated parking demand shall be the sum of the estimated demand of the various individual uses computed separately, in accordance with this section, unless shared parking is approved pursuant to Section 9-4.405.

(b)    Area-Based Estimates. All area-based estimated parking demands shall be computed on the basis of gross square footage, as defined in Chapter 8, which does not include parking or loading areas.

(c)    Exclusion of First One Thousand Five Hundred (1,500) Square Feet. For all nonresidential uses with area-based estimated parking demands, the first one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet shall be subtracted from the gross square footage of the use when calculating the estimated parking demand. When there are multiple principal uses on the same lot with separate estimated parking demands, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the first one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet shall be subtracted from each such use. Any use that occupies one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet or less is not required to provide off-street parking.

(d)    Parking Credit for Re-Use of Significant Structures. Projects that convert a significant structure that has a legal nonconforming parking deficiency to a different use shall receive a credit equal to the number of required automobile parking spaces unmet by the previous use.

(e)    Motorcycle Parking. There shall be a credit of one (1) automobile parking space for every four (4) motorcycle parking spaces provided, not to exceed five percent (5%) of the total number of automobile parking spaces required. Motorcycle parking spaces shall be no less than four feet (4') wide by eight feet (8') long with an aisle width of no less than ten feet (10') and shall be clearly marked.

(f)    If Estimated Parking Demand Is “To Be Determined.”

(1)    If Table 9-4.404 indicates that the estimated parking demand is to be determined (“TBD”), the estimated parking demand shall be determined based on the characteristics of the specific use in question and other similar uses. Where no Planning Commission or City Council approval is required, the Director shall determine the estimated parking demand; the Director’s determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission in accordance with the appeal procedures in Article 14 of Chapter 7. Where Planning Commission or City Council approval is required, the Commission or Council, as the case may be, shall determine the estimated parking demand based on a recommendation from the Director.

(2)    If the Director has classified a use not listed pursuant to Section 9-2.102(d), the estimated parking demand may be determined pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of this section.

(g)    Minimum and Maximum Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no less than the minimum number of parking spaces, and no more than the maximum number of parking spaces, as required by this subsection, shall be provided for each use.

(1)    Minimum. The minimum number of parking spaces required shall be thirty-three percent (33%) less than the estimated parking demand as indicated in Table 9-4.404.

(2)    Maximum. The maximum number of parking spaces allowed shall be ten percent (10%) more than the estimated parking demand as indicated in Table 9-4.404.

(h)    Parking Spaces Below the Minimum or Above the Maximum. Parking spaces less than the required minimum or more than the allowed maximum may be provided upon the granting of a conditional use permit as set forth below.

(1)    Parking Spaces Less Than the Minimum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide less than the minimum number of parking spaces required by subsection (g) of this section, including elimination of all parking spaces, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required by Article 5 of Chapter 7:

a.    That adequate measures will be put in place to reduce parking demand such as promoting use of public transit, bicycling, and walking, and allowing modified working hours and telecommuting.

b.    That the reduction or elimination of the required parking spaces will not result in parking impacts on adjacent uses due to overflow parking.

(2)    Parking Spaces More Than the Maximum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide more than the maximum number of parking spaces allowed by subsection (g) of this section, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required by Article 5 of Chapter 7:

a.    That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the additional parking is required to meet the anticipated parking demand of the proposed uses.

b.    That the provision of the additional parking will not result in an overdependence on automobiles and will not adversely affect transit, bicycle, or pedestrian access to the site or other adjacent uses.

9-4.405 Shared Parking.

(a)    Description. Shared parking represents an arrangement in which two (2) or more nonresidential uses on the same lot with different peak parking demand periods use the same off-street parking spaces to meet their off-street parking requirements.

(b)    Calculation of Parking Requirement for Shared Parking. The estimated parking demand for each use shall be calculated for each hour of a twenty-four (24) hour period, based on the percent of peak demand for each hour. The hourly demand for all uses shall be totaled for each hour, and the greatest resulting hourly demand shall be the required number of parking spaces. This required number may be reduced or increased pursuant to Sections 9-4.404, Calculation of Parking Requirement, and 9-3.406, TH Transit Hub overlay zone. The hourly demand for each use shall be based on the most recent edition of Parking Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or other equivalent information. See Table 9-4.405 for an example.

9-4.406 Design Standards for Parking Lots and Structures.

The parking area design standards of this section apply to all off-street parking areas. All required parking spaces and associated maneuvering aisles, driveways, and other related features shall be designed and arranged so as to provide motor vehicles with adequate ingress to and egress from all required parking spaces, and to provide pedestrians with adequate access to parked vehicles. All parking areas shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Emeryville Design Guidelines, including but not limited to those pertaining to parking and access.

(a)    Parking Layout and Dimensions. The layout and dimensions of off-street parking facilities shall be as set forth in Figure 9-4.406 and Table 9-4.406, as further provided below.

(1)    Regulatory and Calculated Dimensions. Stall width, stall length, and aisle width, as shown in Table 9-4.606, are regulatory. Other dimensions shown in Table 9-4.606 are calculated from these required dimensions, and are provided for convenience.

(2)    Stall Width and Length. As indicated in Table 9-4.606, the required minimum stall width and length for various parking angles are as set forth below. Compact spaces or other size spaces with less width or length are not permitted.

a.    Width. For parking angles of more than thirty (30) degrees the required minimum stall width is eight feet six inches (8'-6"). For parking angles of thirty (30) degrees or less, the required minimum stall width is eight feet (8').

b.    Length. For all parking angles other than parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is eighteen feet (18'). For parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is twenty-two feet (22').

(3)    Aisle Width for Parking Angles Not Shown. For parking angles not shown in Table 9-4.406, the required aisle width shall be interpolated from the values in the table. For example, for a parking angle of seventy (70) degrees, which is two-thirds (2/3) of the increment between sixty (60) degrees and seventy-five (75) degrees, the required one (1) way aisle width is eighteen feet eight inches (18'-8"), which is two-thirds (2/3) of the increment between the required aisle widths for sixty (60) degree parking and seventy-five (75) degree parking, sixteen feet (16') and twenty feet (20'), respectively.

(4)    Alternate Maneuvering Aisle and Parking Space Widths. For parking angles equal to or greater than forty-five (45) degrees and less than ninety (90) degrees, one (1) way aisle width may be decreased by three inches (3") for each one-inch (1") increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches (9'-2"). For ninety (90) degree parking, one (1) way and two (2) way aisle width may be decreased by three inches (3") for each one-inch (1") increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches (9'-2") and a minimum aisle width of twenty-two feet (22').

(5)    Two (2) Way Modules. Table 9-4.606 provides the dimensions for parking modules with one (1) way traffic. For parking modules with two (2) way traffic, add the difference in width between a two (2) way aisle and a one (1) way aisle. For example, for a two (2) way module with a parking angle of forty-five (45) degrees, add eight feet (8'), which is the difference between a two (2) way aisle (twenty feet (20')) and a one (1) way aisle (twelve feet (12')).

(6)    Overhang. Parking stall lengths, except for parallel spaces, may be reduced by two feet (2') where the parking stall is designed to abut a landscaped area a minimum of five feet (5') wide, such that the front of the vehicle can overhang the landscaped area.

(7)    Spaces Abutting Walls or Posts. For each side of a parking space abutting a wall or post, an additional foot of width shall be required.

9-4.407 Alternative Compliance with Parking Requirements.

(a)    Alternative Parking Plan. An alternative parking plan, as provided by this section, may be permitted upon the granting of a conditional use permit. To grant such a conditional use permit, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required by Article 5 of Chapter 7:

(1)    That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that it is physically impossible to provide the required number of parking spaces in conformance with the design standards of Section 9-4.406 on the same lot as the principal use to be served by the parking.

(2)    That a parking arrangement approved pursuant to this section will be in place at all times during operation of the principal uses to be served by the parking.

(b)    Off-Site Parking. The alternative parking plan may allow required off-street parking spaces to be located on a remote and separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located, subject to the following standards:

(1)    Zoning District. Off-site parking may not be located in a zoning district in which the principal use served by the parking is prohibited pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 3.

(2)    Distance. Unless a shuttle service is provided, the off-site parking shall be located within a reasonable walking distance of the principal use served, with consideration given to all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the characteristics of the use served by the parking and the quality of the walk.

(3)    Other Jurisdiction. The off-site parking may be located in Oakland or Berkeley, subject to applicable regulations of that jurisdiction.

(c)    Valet Parking. The alternative parking plan may allow valet parking as a means of satisfying all or a portion of the off-street parking requirement. Valet parking may be used to accommodate more parking spaces on the site of the principal use served by the parking than could be accommodated in conformance with the design standards of Section 9-4.406. It may also be used to provide off-site parking, subject to the requirements of subsections (b)(1) and (3) of this section. Any valet parking shall not cause interference with the public use of rights-of-way or imperil public safety.

(d)    Parking In-Lieu Fees. The alternative parking plan may allow for the payment of a parking in-lieu fee to allow the City to acquire sites for public parking to meet the parking needs that cannot be supplied on site, or for public transportation facilities; provided, that the developer of a nonresidential project contributes toward the acquisition and development of such facilities to the extent that the developer would have been obligated to provide required on-site parking. A parking in-lieu fee shall be provided for nonresidential uses only as follows:

(1)    Parking In-Lieu Fee Amount. The amount of the parking in-lieu fee shall be as set forth in the Master Fee Schedule.

(2)    Deposit of Funds. Parking in-lieu fees shall be deposited with the City of Emeryville prior to issuance of a building permit in a separate fund to be known as the Parking In-Lieu Fee Fund and shall be used for off-street parking facilities, including property acquisition and development of parking facilities located in the general vicinity of the buildings for which the payments are made.

(3)    Refund of Fee. A parking in-lieu fee may be refunded, without interest, to the person who made such payment, or his assignee or designee, if additional off-street parking spaces are provided for such building or use by others than the City, so as to satisfy the parking requirement for which the in-lieu payment was made. To obtain a refund, the required off-street parking spaces must be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy and before funds are spent or committed by the City.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-4.601 Purpose and Applicability.

The purpose of this article is to set forth site development regulations related to the conservation and use of water. These regulations are applicable to all new and existing uses unless otherwise specified.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-4.602 Water Efficient and Bay Friendly Landscaping.

(a)    Purpose. This section establishes water efficient landscaping requirements for new and rehabilitated landscapes. The purpose of the requirements is to foster efficient water use and prevent water waste while ensuring high quality landscapes.

(b)    Applicability. This section shall apply to landscapes for public agency projects and private development projects with a landscape area equal to or greater than five hundred (500) square feet, as specified below.

(c)    Prescriptive Requirements for Smaller Landscapes. New landscaping equal to or greater than five hundred (500) square feet and less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of landscaped area requiring design review shall comply with landscape requirements for smaller landscapes for planting, soil, mulch, grading, and irrigation, as specified by the Director. Any project with a landscape area less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet that meets the landscape water requirement entirely with graywater, rainwater captured on site, or both, is subject only to the sections of the smaller landscapes requirement on “amendments and mulch” and “irrigation.”

(d)    Performance Requirements for Larger Landscapes. New and rehabilitated landscapes with a landscape area equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet shall comply with landscape requirements for larger landscapes for planting, mulch, soil, grading, and irrigation, as specified by the Director.

(e)    Water Waste, Stormwater Treatment and Recycled Water. All projects subject to this section shall comply with all other requirements of the Emeryville Municipal Code, including Chapter 36 of Title 5 prohibiting irrigation water waste, Chapter 13 of Title 6 regarding stormwater treatment, and Section 9-4.603 regarding recycled water.

(f)    Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following:

(1)    Registered historical sites.

(2)    Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system.

(3)    Projects with a landscape area less than five hundred (500) square feet.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005, eff. Oct. 20, 2016)


9-4.603 Recycled Water.

(a)    Purpose. The use of potable water for certain uses when nonpotable water is available and feasible is a waste of water. The purpose of this section is to implement State policies requiring the use of recycled water for nonpotable water uses within the designated recycled water use area when the City determines that there is not an alternative higher or better use for the recycled water, its use is economically justified and its use is financially and technically feasible for a project.

(b)    Use and Distribution of Recycled Water. The use and distribution of recycled water shall be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations.

(c)    Requirement for Subdivisions in Recycled Water Area. Projects involving subdivision of land for which a tentative map or parcel map is required pursuant to California Government Code Section 66426 and Chapter 6 of this title and which are within the recycled water project area shall be conditioned to provide a plumbing system to serve nonpotable uses in the common areas of the subdivision, including but not limited to golf courses, parks, greenbelts, landscaped streets and landscaped medians, if recycled water is available to the project site at a reasonable cost, is of adequate quality, will not be detrimental to public health, and will not adversely affect downstream water rights, degrade water quality or injure plants, fish and wildlife. The Director shall review all subdivision projects that are within the recycled water project area, confer with the recycled water provider, and determine requirements for recycled water plumbing. These requirements shall become conditions of approval.

(d)    Requirement for Nonsubdivision Projects and Projects Outside Recycled Water Area. All projects within the recycled water project area that require Planning Commission or City Council approval, and all projects outside the recycled water project area that include one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of nonresidential space and require Planning Commission or City Council approval, shall be conditioned to require submittal of a letter from the recycled water provider stating requirements for recycled water plumbing, prior to issuance of building permit. In addition, if the project applicant is not complying with the requirements of the recycled water provider, the applicant shall provide a written explanation of its actions.

(e)    Agreement between Recycled Water Producer and Water Supplier. As set forth in California Water Code Section 65605(b)(5), recycled water service shall not commence in any service area of a private utility or public agency retail water supplier that is not a local agency, except in accordance with a written agreement between the recycled water producer and the private utility or public agency retail water supplier.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-4.604 Water Reclaimed On Site.

(a)    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth standards for systems that reuse water on site. Such systems help to conserve valuable water resources and are encouraged; provided, that adequate safeguards are included to protect health.

(b)    Rainwater Capture Systems. Systems that capture and store precipitation from roof areas and other aboveground impervious surfaces for landscape irrigation and/or indoor water use must comply with all applicable codes and regulations. Systems using rain barrels of up to one hundred (100) gallons and no pumps do not require a permit. Systems using cisterns of over one hundred (100) gallons and/or pumps require plumbing and/or electrical permits pursuant to the Emeryville Plumbing Code at Chapter 6 of Title 8 and/or the Emeryville Electrical Code at Chapter 7 of Title 8. Because the Emeryville Plumbing Code has no approved standards for rainwater capture systems, an alternative methods and materials request must accompany the permit application. Landscape projects that are less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in area, and meet the estimated total water use entirely with graywater, rainwater capture, or both, are subject only to the prescriptive irrigation portion and the amendments and mulch portion of the requirements referenced in Section 9-4.602, Water Efficient and Bay Friendly Landscaping. 

(c)    Graywater Systems. Systems that reuse domestic wastewater from plumbing fixtures such as showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers for toilet flushing and irrigation must comply with the requirements for graywater systems of the Emeryville Plumbing Code in Chapter 6 of Title 8. Landscape projects that are less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in area, and meet the estimated total water use entirely with graywater, rainwater capture, or both, are subject only to the prescriptive irrigation portion and the amendments and mulch portion of the requirements referenced in Section 9-4.602, Water Efficient and Bay Friendly Landscaping.

(d)    Blackwater. Wastewater containing food, animal, or human waste, including but not limited to that from toilets and garbage disposals, shall not be reused on site but shall be discharged directly into the sanitary sewer system.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 16-005, eff. Oct. 20, 2016; Sec. 4 (part), Ord. 16-008, eff. Jan. 1, 2017)

Article 3.    Adult Oriented Businesses


9-5.301 Purpose.

This article establishes the adult entertainment regulations. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies contained in the General Plan, particularly those relating to the conservation of existing neighborhoods and the compatibility of uses. In adopting this article, it is recognized that certain types of adult entertainment businesses possess certain objectionable operational characteristics which, if such uses are allowed to concentrate, will have adverse effects upon the character of the areas in which they concentrate and adjacent neighborhoods. Special regulation of adult entertainment uses is therefore necessary to ensure that these adverse effects of adult entertainment uses will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of zoning districts in which they are permitted or of surrounding neighborhoods.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.302 Effect.

This article shall not be interpreted as legalizing or condoning the production, presentation, sale, advertisement, dissemination, or distribution of matter which is obscene as defined and regulated by applicable State and local laws; nor shall this article be interpreted as legalizing or condoning participation in management, production, presentation, or exhibition of obscene live conduct in any public place or any place exposed to the public view as defined and regulated by applicable State and local law; nor shall this article be interpreted as legalizing or condoning any other activity which is otherwise prohibited by State or local law.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.303 Home Occupations.

It is unlawful to establish any adult entertainment business as defined in this article as a Home Occupation as defined in Article 8 of this chapter.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.304 Districts Where Allowed.

It is unlawful to establish any adult entertainment business as defined in this article in any district other than the INH Heavy Industrial zone.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.305 Location Requirements.

Within the INH Heavy Industrial zone, no adult entertainment business shall be established in the following locations:

(a)    Within two hundred feet (200') of any area zoned for residential use;

(b)    Within five hundred feet (500') of any other adult entertainment business;

(c)    Within one thousand feet (1,000') of any public park, religious institution or elementary or secondary school.

The distance between any two (2) adult entertainment businesses shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the closest exterior structural wall of each business. The distance between any adult entertainment business and any residential district, religious institution, school, or public park shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the closest property line of the residential zone, religious institution, school, or public park to the closest exterior structural wall of such adult entertainment business.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.306 Conditional Use Permit Required.

It is unlawful to establish an adult entertainment business without first obtaining a conditional use permit as provided in this article. No other use permit shall be required to operate an adult entertainment business. No final action may be taken by the Planning Commission until the Emeryville Police Department has issued an operating permit for the use or a statement that such permit is not required. To grant a conditional use permit for an adult entertainment business, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required by Article 5 of Chapter 7:

(a)    That the proposed adult entertainment business meets all of the location requirements of Section 9-5.305.

(b)    That the proposed adult entertainment business will not be open between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. daily.

(c)    That the proposed adult entertainment business will not use electronic amplification between midnight and 6:00 a.m. daily.

(d)    That the proposed adult entertainment business will be adequately soundproofed or insulated for noise and operated so that incidental noise shall not be audible beyond the premises.

(e)    That the proposed adult entertainment business will comply with all applicable performance standards in Article 11 of this chapter.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.307 Conditions of Approval.

In approving a conditional use permit for an adult entertainment business, the Planning Commission may designate such conditions as it deems necessary in order to fulfill the purposes of this article, and may require reasonable guarantees and evidence that such conditions are being, or will be, complied with. Such conditions shall not be less restrictive than the conditions attached to any operating permit issued by the Emeryville Police Department, and may include, but are not limited to, designating hours of operation more restrictive than those listed in Section 9-5.306(b).

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.308 Public Display of Certain Matter Prohibited.

All building openings, entries, and windows of adult entertainment businesses shall be located, covered, or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any public or semipublic area, including public sidewalks, streets, arcades, hallways, or passageways of any material which has as its primary or dominant theme matter depicting, illustrating, describing, or relating to “specified sexual activities” or “specified anatomical areas” as defined in this article.

Article 4.    Affordable Housing Program


9-5.401 Created.

To lessen the shortage of housing affordable to moderate, median, low, and very low income households in the City of Emeryville as partial compliance with California Government Code Section 65583(c), there is hereby created an affordable housing program.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-009, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.402 General Requirements for New Ownership Residential Projects of Ten (10) or More Dwelling Units.

(a) Developers of new ownership residential projects (both new construction and conversion of nonresidential space to a residential use) of ten (10) or more dwelling units or lots, including but not limited to, single-family dwellings, or condominium developments, either partially or completely in Emeryville, shall be conditioned to provide a designated percentage of the dwelling units in the project as units affordable to moderate income households for a minimum period of forty-five (45) years from date of availability as more fully described below, unless the developer, in agreement with the City Council, elects to commit to a fixed percentage of the affordable units as being affordable to median income households in return for a reduction of the affordability percentage.

(b) Any development permit for new ownership residential projects (both new construction and conversion) of ten (10) or more dwelling units or parcels that provide affordable units pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall have conditions attached which will assure compliance with the provisions of this article. The conditions shall require a written agreement to indicate the number, type, location, approximate size, and construction scheduling of all dwelling units, the appropriate price levels, provision for income certification and screening of potential occupants of affordable units, a resale control mechanism, a density bonus, if applicable, and such reasonable information as shall be required by the City for the purpose of determining the applicant’s compliance with this article.

(c) All affordable units in a project and phases of a project should be constructed concurrently with or prior to the construction of non-affordable units, unless the City determines that extenuating circumstances exist.

(d) All affordable units shall be occupied by moderate or median income households as certified by the City or its operating agent.

(e) Unless the City finds compelling reasons to the contrary, the affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the development, the mix and type of affordable units shall be proportionate to those of the project as a whole, and the affordable units shall be comparable with the design of the base level market rate units prior to purchaser-funded upgrades in terms of appearance, materials, and quality of finishes. Parking designated for the affordable units shall be provided in an equitable manner as that provided for the market rate units. The written agreement referred to in subsection (b) of this section shall include a breakdown of the types of units provided as affordable, which shall be directly proportionate to the types of units in the project as a whole under the provisions of this subsection (e) of this section.

(f) The applicant shall have the option, with the approval of the City, to transfer credit for affordable units constructed at one (1) location within the City to satisfy the requirements of this article. The affordability requirement may be satisfied with construction of dwelling units up to twelve (12) months prior to the approval of the project.

(g) Upon a finding by the City that the construction of the required affordable units is not feasible or appropriate as part of a larger development project, the applicant shall have the option to construct the affordable units on a site or sites not contiguous with the development, but within the Emeryville City limits.

(h) The applicant shall have the option, with the concurrence of the City, in a home ownership project, of constructing rental affordable units in a number sufficient to meet the requirements of this article if the provision of the affordable units is consistent with Section 9-5.407.

(i) Where the applicant elects to initially rent all of the units in an ownership residential project, the applicant shall have the option of providing rental affordable units if the provision of the units is consistent with Section 9-5.407.

(j) Where units at a separate location are used to meet the affordability requirements under subsections (f), (g), and (h) of this section, the affordability percentage shall be applied to the number of units at the two (2) or more locations combined.

(k) Where the applicant is willing to commit to making a portion of the affordable units affordable to median income households for forty-five (45) years:

(1) The applicant can seek approval by the City under subsection (a) of this section to reduce the number of units required; and

(2) The City may subsidize the cost of traffic impact fees, if any, building permit fees, and other fees and exactions that may be required of some or all of the project units.

(l) Prior to City approval of a lesser percentage of affordable units in return for targeting to median income under subsections (a) and (k) of this section, the City must find that the request provides at least an equivalent contribution toward City goals.

(m) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the owner of any rental residential project or the owner of any ownership residential project that is initially rented, whether constructed prior to or after the original adoption of Article 7 of Chapter 6 of this title, and that contains ten (10) or more dwelling units on lots, shall be required to notify the City at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to a proposed change to the tenure of the residential project from rental units to for-sale, ownership units, as well as at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to any proposed transfer or assignment of project, such that the requirements of this chapter that are effective as of the date of said notification to the City will be imposed on the ownership residential project through execution of a written agreement as referred to in Section 9-5.402(b) and any other agreements as required by the City (such as an assignment and assumption agreement).

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-009, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.403 Affordable Unit Requirements for Ownership Residential Projects.

(a) In new ownership residential projects, twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units shall be affordable to moderate income households as provided above. The housing unit sales prices corresponding to these income ranges shall be established by the City or its designee. In ownership residential projects located partially in Emeryville, twenty percent (20%) of the units in Emeryville shall be affordable units or ten percent (10%) of all of the units in the project shall be affordable units with all of the affordable units located in Emeryville, whichever is greater. In applying these percentages, any decimal fraction less than or equal to one-half (0.50) may be disregarded and any decimal fraction greater than one-half (0.50) shall be construed as requiring one dwelling unit.

(b) The developer shall offer to sell the affordable units required by this article to eligible purchasers for a period of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the City’s issuance of the certificate of occupancy for each particular affordable unit, with the sale being completed within ninety (90) days thereafter. At the end of the one hundred twenty (120) day marketing period, the City, in its sole discretion, may require the developer to extend its sales efforts for an additional sixty (60) day period. The developer shall actively market the units during this period and implement any suggestions provided by the City. Furthermore, if negotiating the agreement with the developer, the City may require that the marketing periods be extended depending on the number of units to be constructed and marketed at that same time.

(c) If the developer is unable to sell some or all of the affordable units at the end of the marketing period described in subsection (b) of this section, the City shall be offered the opportunity to sell the units for a period of no less than sixty (60) days, with sales being completed within ninety (90) days thereafter. During this period, the City or its designee may purchase the units.

(d) If the developer, City, or the City’s operating agent are unable to sell some or all of the affordable units at the end of the marketing periods described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and the City or its designee does not purchase the units, then the developer may sell the affordable units at an unrestricted price to a bona fide purchaser for value and pay the City an amount equal to the difference between the sales price and the affordable cost established by the City. After payment of the required amount to the City, all sale and resale restrictions shall be removed from the affordable unit.

(e) The developer shall advertise the initial availability of all affordable units in a project to the Emeryville general public through a marketing program approved by the City. The developer shall seek qualified purchasers through a process involving community outreach and broad marketing efforts, informational workshops, an application, a lottery, and application review and processing. The City or its operating agent shall review the assets and income of prospective purchasers of the ownership affordable units on a project-by-project basis and shall make the final decision about income eligibility. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, preference will be given first to residents of Emeryville and second to people employed in Emeryville, or to other preferences as adopted by the City for a particular ownership residential project subject to this article. As part of its review of the eligibility of prospective purchasers, the City or its operating agent shall advise all prospective purchasers of the resale restrictions applicable to ownership affordable units as specified in this article and shall require all purchasers to participate in City-approved homebuyer education prior to the close on escrow of the purchaser’s affordable unit.

(f) The City shall enter into recorded agreements with developers, and take other appropriate steps necessary to assure that the required moderate and median income ownership units are provided and that the units remain affordable to moderate or median income households for a period of at least forty-five (45) years from the recordation of the purchase agreement.

9-5.404 Household Eligibility Requirements for Affordable Units.

(a) In establishing moderate, median, low or very low household income, the City or its designee shall consider, among other things, the median household income data provided periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, household size and number of dependents, and all sources of household income and assets.

(b) Every purchaser of an affordable unit shall certify by a form acceptable to the City that the dwelling unit is being purchased for the purchaser’s primary place of residence. The City or its operating agent shall verify this certification. Failure, by the purchaser, to maintain eligibility for homeowners’ property tax exemption shall be construed to mean that the affordable unit is not the primary place of residence of the purchaser. Should the purchaser fail to make the unit his/her principal place of residence within six (6) months following notice by the City of the failure to comply with this provision, such failure shall authorize the City to send a subsequent notice that it treats the failure as a sale which triggers a preemptive option for the City to purchase such unit consistent with the procedures set out in Section 9-5.405(b); provided, that no sale is deemed to occur, no option periods are triggered, and no rights of the City are extinguished if it does not send the second written notice deeming the failure of the owner to comply as a sale.

(c) The policies governing the selection of home buyers for certification by the City or its operating agent under the provisions of this article shall be established by the City. These shall include, but not be limited to, maximum income and asset limits, order of preference, and policy on first-time home buyers. The most recently established criteria shall be used by the City or its operating agent in selecting home buyers and in structuring any lottery.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-009, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.405 Control of Resale of Ownership Affordable Units.

(a) In order to maintain the availability of the affordable units as may be constructed pursuant to the requirements of this article, the City shall impose the following resale conditions for a minimum period of forty-five (45) years from the recordation of each grant deed, which forty-five (45) year period shall start over with each resale. The price received by the seller of an affordable unit shall be limited to the lesser of a bona fide offer to purchase or the price affordable to a moderate income household. If the affordable unit has been established for a median income household through an agreement with the developer as provided in Section 9-5.402(k), then the price of the unit shall be the lesser of the bona fide offer to purchase or the price affordable to a median income household, as applicable.

(b) Home ownership affordable units shall be sold and resold from the date of the original sale only to moderate and median income households as determined to be eligible for affordable units by the City or its operating agent according to the requirements of this article. When an owner of an affordable unit desires to sell the unit, the owner shall notify the City. The owner shall market the unit to eligible purchasers for a period of not less than ninety (90) days from the date of notification to the City of the desire to sell and of initiation of marketing (unit is available for viewing and designated contact person available to respond to inquiries), with the sale being completed within ninety (90) days thereafter. If the owner is unable to sell the unit to an eligible purchaser, then the City shall be offered the opportunity to sell the unit for a period of no less than sixty (60) days, with sale being completed within ninety (90) days thereafter. During this period, the City or its designee may purchase the units. The seller shall not levy or charge any additional fees nor shall any finder’s fee or other monetary consideration be allowed other than customary real estate commissions and closing costs.

(c) If the owner, City, or the City’s operating agent are unable to sell the unit at the end of the marketing periods described in subsection (b) of this section, and the City or its designee does not purchase the units, then the owner may sell the affordable unit at an unrestricted price to a bona fide purchaser for value and pay the City an amount equal to the difference between the sales price and the affordable cost established by the City. After payment of the required amount to the City, all sale and resale restrictions shall be removed from the affordable unit.

(d) The owners of any affordable unit shall attach and legally reference in the grant deed conveying title of any such affordable ownership unit a declaration of restriction provided by the City or its operating agent stating the restrictions imposed pursuant to this article. The grant deed shall afford the grantor and the City the right to enforce the attached declaration of restrictions. The declaration of restrictions shall include all applicable resale controls, occupancy restrictions, and prohibitions as required by this article. Should the City provide subsidies or financing for any affordable unit, including down payment assistance loans, it will require the filing of a deferred payment subordinate deed of trust in favor of the City, having such terms as the City shall from time to time require, and that subordinate deed of trust shall incorporate and make further enforceable the declaration of restrictions referred to in this subsection.

(e) The City or its operating agent shall be given the responsibility of monitoring the resale of ownership affordable units. Any violation of the resale provisions shall be referred to the City for appropriate action.

9-5.406 New Rental Residential Projects – Affordable Housing Impact Fees.

(a) Rental residential projects shall pay affordable housing impact fees as prescribed by this section to mitigate the project’s impact on the need for affordable housing in the City, unless the applicant elects to provide on-site rental affordable units consistent with Section 9-5.407, or is granted a development bonus for the provision of on-site affordable housing pursuant to Section 9-4.204 or a density bonus for the provision of on-site affordable housing pursuant to Article 5 of this chapter.

(b) Affordable housing impact fees for rental residential projects shall be established by resolution of the City Council and may be amended from time to time as required. Such fees shall not exceed the cost of mitigating the impact of market rate residential projects on the need for affordable housing in the City.

(c) Except as provided in Section 9-5.1906, the affordable housing impact fee shall be paid upon issuance of a building permit for each dwelling unit in the rental residential project. The amount of any affordable housing impact fee payable under this section shall be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit for the dwelling unit to which the fee relates.

(d)    Affordable housing impact fees established pursuant to this section shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Article 19 of this chapter.

In calculating the number of required rental affordable units, any decimal fraction less than or equal to one-half (0.50) may be disregarded and any decimal fraction greater than one-half (0.50) shall be construed as requiring one dwelling unit.

(b) To ensure compliance with the Costa-Hawkins Act (Chapter 2.7 of Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code), the City may only approve a proposal to provide rental affordable units if the applicant agrees in a recorded agreement with the City to limit rents in consideration for a direct financial contribution or a form of assistance specified in Chapter 4.3 (commencing with Section 65915) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code.

(c) Any development permit for a new residential project (both new construction and conversion) that provides rental affordable units pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall have conditions attached which will assure compliance with the provisions of this article. The conditions shall require an agreement to be recorded prior to occupancy that indicates the number, type, location, approximate size, and construction scheduling of all dwelling units, the appropriate rent levels, provision for income certification and screening of potential occupants of affordable units, a density bonus, if applicable, compliance with the Costa-Hawkins Act, and such reasonable information as shall be required by the City for the purpose of determining the applicant’s compliance with this article. The agreement shall require that the rental affordable units be rented to low income households for a period of at least fifty-five (55) years from the date of recordation of the agreement, unless all of the units in the residential project are offered to the public for purchase. In that event, the applicant shall provide twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units as ownership affordable units complying with Sections 9-5.402 through 9-5.405. The recorded agreement shall provide relocation benefits for tenants of the rental affordable units in the event of sale.

(c) Unless the City finds compelling reasons to the contrary, the rental affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the development, the mix and type of rental affordable units shall be proportionate to those of the project as a whole, and shall be comparable with the design of the base level market rate units prior to purchaser-funded upgrades in terms of appearance, materials, and quality of finishes. Parking designated for the rental affordable units shall be provided in an equitable manner as that provided for the market rate units. The written agreement referred to in Section 9-5.407(c) shall include a breakdown of the rental affordable units, which shall be directly proportionate to the types of units in the project as a whole under the provisions of this subsection (c).

(d) The developer shall market the rental affordable units as required by this article to eligible renters throughout the duration of the written agreement referred to in Section 9-5.407(c). No less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the initial lease up of the affordable units, the developer shall provide the City, for its review and approval, a marketing program for the affordable units, which program shall be in conformance with the City’s affordable unit marketing program procedures promulgated by the City, as may be amended from time to time. During the initial lease up of the affordable units, the developer shall market the affordable units commencing upon approval of the marketing program by the City for a period of time no less than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the City’s issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the project. At the end of the one hundred twenty (120) day marketing period, the City, in its sole discretion, may require the developer to extend its marketing efforts for an additional sixty (60) day period increment. The developer shall actively market the units during this period and implement any suggestions provided by the City. Furthermore, in negotiating the written agreement with the developer, the City may require that the marketing periods be extended depending on the number of units to be constructed and marketed at that same time.

(d) As an alternative to payment of the affordable housing impact fee set forth in this section, an applicant for a nonresidential project may submit a request to mitigate the affordable housing impacts of such development through the construction of affordable units, either on site or off site, through the dedication of land, or through other means. The City Council may approve or conditionally approve such an alternative if the City Council determines, based on substantial evidence, that such alternative compliance will provide as much or more affordable housing at the same or lower income levels as will payment of the affordable housing impact fee, is consistent with the General Plan and Housing Element, and will otherwise provide as great a public benefit as would payment of the affordable housing impact fee. Any affordable units constructed on site or off site shall comply with the provisions contained in Sections 9-5.402 through 9-5.408, as applicable.

(c) The fees collected under this article and all earnings from investment of the fees shall be expended exclusively to provide or assure continued provision of affordable housing in the City to meet the housing needs of the City’s workforce through acquisition, construction, development assistance, substantial rehabilitation, financing, rent or other subsidies, or other methods, and for costs of administering programs which serve those ends. The housing shall be of a type, or made affordable at a cost or rent, for which there is a need in the City and which is not adequately supplied in the City by private housing development in the absence of public assistance and to the extent feasible shall be utilized to provide for moderate, median, low, very low, and extremely low income housing.

(Formerly 9-5.410. Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-009, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)

9-5.417 Waiver.

(a) As part of an application for the first approval of a residential project or nonresidential project, an applicant may apply for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of the requirements of this article based upon a showing that applying the requirements of this article would result in an unconstitutional taking of property or would result in any other unconstitutional result. The applicant shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim, including all supporting technical documentation, and shall bear the burden of presenting the requisite evidence to demonstrate the alleged unconstitutional result. The City may assume each of the following when applicable:

(1) The applicant will benefit from the incentives set forth in the City Code; and

(2) The applicant will provide the most economical affordable units feasible in terms of financing, construction, design, location and tenure.

(b) The City Council, based upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the City Attorney, may approve a reduction, adjustment, or waiver if the approval authority determines that applying the requirements of this article would effectuate an unconstitutional taking of property or otherwise have an unconstitutional application to the property. The reduction, adjustment, or waiver shall be approved only to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, after adoption of written findings, and based on legal analysis and the evidence. If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change in the residential or nonresidential project shall invalidate the reduction, adjustment, or waiver, and a new application shall be required for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver pursuant to this section.

(a)    The City shall grant one (1) density bonus as described in Section 9-5.505, and incentives or concessions as described in Section 9-5.506, when an applicant for a residential development project agrees to construct at least any one (1) of the following:

(1)    At least ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units of a residential development project for low income households.

(2)    At least five percent (5%) of the total dwelling units of a residential development project for very low income households.

(3)    A senior citizen housing development or a mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing older persons pursuant to California Civil Code Section 798.76 or 799.5.

(4)    Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a common interest development as defined in California Civil Code Section 1351, for persons and families of moderate income; provided, that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase.

The applicant shall elect whether the density bonus shall be awarded on the basis of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section. A density bonus awarded under this section allows a residential development to exceed the maximum residential density as provided by Section 9-4.203. The maximum residential density shall be the base density established in Table 9-4.203(a) and Figure 9-4.203(a). The granting of a density bonus, concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. The density bonus shall not be included when determining the number of dwelling units that is equal to five percent (5%) or ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units.

For those projects that are subject to the provisions of the Affordable Housing Program (in Article 4 of this chapter), affordable units provided pursuant to that article may be counted toward the requirements of this section. To the extent that the provisions of this section and the affordable housing provisions are in conflict, the provisions of the Affordable Housing Program prevail. However, if such affordable units are used to fulfill the requirements of Section 9-4.204, the density bonuses of this article are not available.

(b)    In addition, the following projects are eligible for a density bonus as provided in Section 9-5.505:

(1)    Residential developments that include the donation of land.

(2)    Residential developments that include child care facilities.

(3)    Condominium conversions.

9-5.504 Application Requirements.

An applicant shall file a written application in accord with the application procedures under Article 2 of Chapter 7 and any specific application requirements established by the Director for this use.

(a)    Application for density bonus shall be made concurrent with submittals required for the processing of associated discretionary permits. The request for density bonus shall be articulated as part of the description and justification for the development project. The request for the density bonus shall specify the percentage of density bonus sought, per Section 9-5.503, and indicate how the affordable housing obligations will be met.

(b)    The review process for a density bonus project shall be the same as that required for associated discretionary permits. Discretionary actions on density bonus projects shall be subject to the same appeal process applied to associated discretionary permits.

(c)    The application and approval of a density bonus and any associated incentives or concessions shall not require a separate permit or approval process from that otherwise required for the same project without a density bonus request.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)

Nothing in this section shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the City’s authority to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

(3)    An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this section if all the following criteria are met:

a.    The applicant donates and transfers the land to the City no later than the date of the approval by the City of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application.

b.    The developable land and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the residential units of the proposed development.

c.    The transferred land is at least one (1) acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least forty (40) units, has the appropriate General Plan designation, is appropriately zoned with appropriate development standards for development at the density described in California Government Code Section 65583.2, subdivision (c), paragraph 3, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure.

d.    The transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very low income housing units on the transferred land, not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application, except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by California Government Code Section 65583.2(i), if the design is not reviewed by the City prior to the transfer.

e.    The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction, which shall be recorded on the property upon dedication, ensuring continued affordability of the units for at least thirty (30) years.

f.    The land is transferred to the City or to a housing developer approved by the City.

g.    The transferred land is within the proposed development or, if the City agrees, within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the boundary of the proposed development.

a.    The child care facility shall remain in operation as long as or longer than that time during which the affordable housing units are required to remain affordable pursuant to this section; and

b.    Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income households, low income households, or families of moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are made affordable to very low income households, low income households, or moderate income households.

(4)    Notwithstanding any requirement of this section, the City need not provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that Emeryville has adequate child care facilities.

(g)    Condominium Conversion Developments.

(1)    When a development is the conversion of an existing apartment complex to a condominium complex and the applicant agrees to make at least thirty-three percent (33%) of the total units of the development affordable to moderate income households for thirty (30) years, or fifteen percent (15%) of the total units of the proposed development affordable to low income households for thirty (30) years, and agrees to pay for the administrative costs incurred by the City to process the application and to monitor the continued affordability and habitability of the affordable housing units, the City shall either:

(5)    The City shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless the City makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of any of the following:

a.    The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for targeted units to be set as specified.

b.    The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in California Government Code Section 65589.5, subdivision (d), paragraph (2), upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact, without rendering the development unaffordable to low or moderate income households.

c.    The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law.

The purpose of these provisions is to regulate uses of land and structures that were legal before the adoption or amendment of these planning regulations, but which no longer comply. The intent of this article is to permit nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed or required to be terminated, but not to encourage their survival. More specifically, it is the intent of this article to distinguish between incompatible nonconforming uses that are detrimental to public health, safety, and general welfare, and nonconforming uses that are economically productive and compatible with surrounding development despite being inconsistent with the use regulations of these planning regulations.

(c)    General Manufacturing Uses. Any General Manufacturing use, lot, or structure in the INL Light Industrial zone that was legally established prior to the adoption of these planning regulations and that has been continuously maintained in compliance with the requirements of all applicable codes is deemed to be a conforming use, lot, or structure.

(d)    Public Uses. Provided that there is no change of use, nothing in this article shall require the termination, discontinuance, or removal of a public use or a public utility or to prevent the expansion, modernization, replacement, repair, maintenance, alteration, reconstruction, or rebuilding and continuation of public use or utility buildings, structures, equipment, and facilities.

(e)    Planned Unit Developments. Planned unit developments approved prior to the adoption of these planning regulations, as listed in Section 9-3.310, are subject to the use and development regulations stipulated in the various ordinances establishing the PUDs.

(f)    Other Planning Entitlements. Any use allowed under a planning entitlement, including but not limited to a conditional use permit, design review permit, or variance, that was approved prior to the adoption of these planning regulations and that has not expired, is deemed to be a conforming use and is subject to any conditions included in its approval. If such a use is not permitted by these planning regulations, it may be expanded pursuant to Section 9-5.1011, except those uses that are deemed incompatible pursuant to Section 9-5.1007.

(Formerly 9-5.1211. Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 15-011, eff. Jan. 14, 2016)

Article 13.    Private Property Access from City Parks, Greenways, and Other City Property


9-5.1301 Purpose.

This article establishes regulations for accessing private property from City parks, greenways, and other City property. Such access can help to enliven parks and greenways and may provide the only feasible means of access in some situations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1302 Applicability.

The provisions of this article shall apply whenever a private property owner seeks to gain access to the private property from a City park, greenway, or other City-owned property. Such access may include the entire property or individual dwelling units, Live/Work Units, commercial tenant spaces, or other individual units of the property. Nothing in this article shall restrict access to private property from any public right-of-way, which shall be subject to all other applicable laws and regulations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1303 Conditional Use Permit Required.

No private property shall be accessed from a City park, greenway, or other City property by pedestrians, bicycles, motor vehicles, or any other means except upon the granting of a minor conditional use permit pursuant to the requirements of this article. Such a conditional use permit approves access from the City park, greenway, or other City property and includes approval of any and all access improvements on the private property, but does not constitute an entitlement for use of the City park, greenway, or other City property in perpetuity.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1304 Allowable Uses.

Except for Eating and Drinking Establishments, no use of special concern, as listed in Section 9-2.701, shall gain access from a City park, greenway, or other City property unless it is the only feasible means of access.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1305 Alternate Access.

To the extent feasible, a second means of access to the private property shall be provided so that access from a City park, greenway, or other City property is not the sole means of access to the private property or any of its individual spaces or units. If access from a City park, greenway, or other City property is the only feasible means of access to the private property, the owner of the private property shall be responsible, in cooperation with the City, for facilitating access to the private property in the event that the City needs to close or restrict access to the park, greenway, or other City property for maintenance, repairs, or other reasons. The owner of the private property shall bear all costs associated with facilitating such access during closure or restriction of the park, greenway, or other City property.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1306 Limitations.

Access to private property from a City park, greenway, or other City property shall be limited to pedestrian and bicycle access, unless it provides the only feasible means of access for motor vehicles.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1307 Landscaping and Maintenance of Property Gaining Access.

Private property gaining access from a City park, greenway, or other City property shall be attractively landscaped in conformance with all requirements of this Code, the Emeryville Design Guidelines, and all other applicable design guidelines such as the North Hollis Urban Design Plan or the Park Avenue District Plan. Such landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition at all times, and the overall property shall be maintained free of trash, litter, graffiti, weeds, peeling paint, and any other blighting conditions, in conformance with the requirements of Chapters 2 and 11 of Title 6 and all other applicable laws and regulations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1308 Access Facilities.

The private property owner shall be responsible for providing a suitable all weather pedestrian and/or bicycle path from the pedestrian and/or bicycle path on the City property to the pedestrian and/or bicycle access point on the private property. If motor vehicle access is to be provided, a driveway conforming to the requirements of Article 4 of Chapter 4 shall be provided. The private property owner shall be responsible for bearing all costs of design, construction, operation and ongoing maintenance of such access facilities both on the City property and on the private property. If a door into a building is provided on the private property, it shall not swing over the property line onto the City property; if necessary to prevent this, the door shall be inset into the wall of the private building.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1309 Financial Contribution to Citywide Parks Fund.

As a condition of gaining access from a City park, greenway, or other City property, the owner of the private property shall make a one (1) time lump sum contribution to the Citywide Parks Fund in an amount equal to the value of the access as determined by an appraisal prepared at the applicant’s expense under the direction of the City. This shall be in addition to the application fee and any other fees prescribed by the Master Fee Schedule. This condition may be waived, or the amount of the contribution reduced, if the property owner is required to construct or make improvements to the park, greenway, or City property, other than the proposed access facilities, or if the City Council determines that the benefit of the access to the City outweighs the benefit of the access to the applicant.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-5.1310 Application.

An application for access to private property from a City park, greenway, or other City property shall be submitted to the Planning and Building Department on a form provided by the Director, accompanied by the fee as set forth in the Master Fee Schedule and application materials as determined necessary by the Director, including but not limited to the following:

(a)    A site plan, dimensioned, clearly labeled, and drawn to a standard architectural or engineering scale, showing the entire area where the private property interfaces with the park, greenway, or other City property, including other properties and public rights-of-way within ten feet (10') in all directions. The site plan shall clearly indicate:

(1)    The location of any and all features on the private property and in the park, greenway, or other City property, including but not limited to pedestrian and bicycle paths, trees, tree wells and grates, lights, signs, utility poles, trash containers, kiosks, planters, benches, play equipment, driveways, parking and loading areas, buildings, doorways, and disabled access ramps.

(2)    The proposed access pathways and/or driveways from the park, greenway, or other City property onto the private property, indicating dimensions and materials.

(3)    The relationship of the proposed access pathways and/or driveways to other adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, including any doors and windows.

(4)    The pedestrian, bicycle, and/or motor vehicle circulation routes and disabled access paths of travel if applicable.

(2)    Double-Faced Signs. Where two (2) faces of a double-faced sign are located two feet (2') or less from one another at all points, or located at an interior angle of forty-five (45) degrees or less from one another, the sign area shall be computed as the area of one (1) face. Where the two (2) faces are not equal in size, the larger sign face shall be used. Where two (2) faces of a double-faced sign are located more than two feet (2') or forty-five (45) degrees from one another, both sign faces shall be counted toward sign area. See Figure 9-5.1606(a)(2-3).

(3)    Multi-Faced Signs. On a three (3) faced sign, where at least one (1) interior angle is forty-five (45) degrees or less, the area of two (2) faces (the largest and smallest face) shall be summed to determine sign area. In all other situations involving a sign with three (3) or more sides, sign area shall be calculated as the sum of all faces. See Figure 9-5.1606(a)(2-3).

(4)    Three (3) Dimensional Signs. Signs that consist of, or have attached to them, one (1) or more three (3) dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks), shall have a sign area of the sum of all areas using the four (4) vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign. See Figure 9-5.1606(a)(4).

(b)    Materials. Signs shall be constructed of durable and attractive materials. Paper, cardboard, or other material subject to rapid deterioration shall be limited to temporary interior window signs. Fabric and vinyl signs shall be restricted to public service and civic identity signs, awning signs, banner signs, and temporary signs permitted pursuant to Section 9-5.1610.

(1)    Sign lighting shall not be of an intensity or brightness, or generate glare, that will create a public or private nuisance.

(2)    External light sources shall be directed, shielded, and filtered to limit direct illumination of any object other than the sign.

(3)    Illuminated roof signs and high-rise identification signs shall be dimmable, and shall be dimmed if necessary to address complaints of glare from occupants of buildings in a direct line of sight to the sign. Other sign types may also be required to be dimmable as a condition of approval.

(4)    Exterior LED signs shall be subject to major design review pursuant to Section 9-5.1612(c), and shall be evaluated for conformance with the “Recommended Night-Time Brightness Levels for On-Premise Electronic Message Centers (EMC’s)” dated April 2011 prepared by the International Sign Association.

(a)    Permitted Signs. In addition to the exempt signs listed in Section 9-5.1605, all sign types listed in Table 9-5.1607 are permitted, subject to the standards in the table. Sign types not listed in Table 9-5.1607, or signs not in conformance with the standards in Table 9-5.1607, may be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the applicant proposes that such signs be included in the aggregate sign area allowed by subsection (b) of this section, they may be considered by the Director under the minor design review procedure at Section 9-5.1612(b). If the applicant proposes that such signs not be included in the aggregate sign area allowed by subsection (b) of this section, they shall be considered by the Planning Commission under the major design review procedure at Section 9-5.1612(c).

(b)    Aggregate Sign Area.

(1)    Individual Establishments.

a.    The maximum aggregate sign area for individual establishments is one (1) square foot of sign area per linear foot of public frontage. “Public frontage” refers to either building frontage on a public street or, if the establishment does not front on a public street, the building facade of the establishment accessible to the public on which the main entrance to the establishment is located. In a multi-tenant property, the frontage is typically measured from lease-line to lease-line.

b.    If an establishment has frontage on more than one (1) public street or more than one (1) publicly accessible facade, all such frontages may be included in the calculation of aggregate sign area, except service roads, alleys, and similar accessways intended primarily for service vehicles.

The aggregate sign area for overall site signage shall be no more than is necessary to adequately identify the site and its major tenants, and shall not include the aggregate sign area of individual establishments, as determined pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-001, eff. Mar. 6, 2014)


9-5.1610 Temporary Commercial Signs.

Temporary commercial signs meeting the requirements of this section may be permitted in all zones other than the RM Medium Density Residential zone upon the approval of a minor design review permit pursuant to Section 9-5.1612(b). This section does not apply to temporary change of business signs, which are exempt from design review pursuant to Section 9-5.1605(f).

(a)    Number. A maximum of two (2) temporary commercial signs may be displayed by any individual establishment at the same time.

(b)    Area. The total area of all such temporary commercial signs shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet per individual establishment. This sign area shall not be included in the calculation of aggregate permanent sign area pursuant to Section 9-5.1609(b).

If located in windows or transparent doors, no more than twenty percent (20%) of the total area of any window or transparent door shall be covered by any combination of temporary commercial signs, exempt temporary window signs pursuant to Section 9-5.1605(s), and permanent window signs pursuant to (a)(7) in Table 9-5.1607.

(e)    Duration. The time limit for display of a temporary commercial sign shall be forty-five (45) days, which may be renewed for one (1) additional period of forty-five (45) days upon payment of a second application fee. Two (2) consecutive forty-five (45) day periods may be approved at one (1) time upon the payment of two (2) fees, but may not be further extended.

(f)    Illumination. Temporary signs shall not be illuminated.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-001, eff. Mar. 6, 2014)


9-5.1611 Design Principles.

The following design principles shall be used as criteria for review and approval of design review for individual signs and Master Sign Programs.

(a)    Architectural Compatibility. A sign (including its supporting structure, if any) shall be designed as an integral design element of a building’s architecture and shall be architecturally compatible, including color and scale, with any building to which the sign is to be attached and with surrounding structures. A sign that covers a window or that spills over “natural” boundaries or architectural features and obliterates parts of upper floors of buildings is detrimental to visual order and generally is not permitted.

(b)    Legibility. The size and proportion of the elements of the sign’s message, including logos, letters, icons and other graphic images, shall be selected based on the average distance and average travel speed of the viewer. Sign messages oriented towards pedestrians may be smaller than those oriented towards automobile drivers. Colors chosen for the sign text and/or graphics shall have sufficient contrast with the sign background in order to be easily read during both day and night hours.

(c)    Design Guidelines. All signs shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Emeryville Design Guidelines, including but not limited to those pertaining to signs and to the area of the City in which a proposed sign is to be located, and to any other applicable design guidelines.

(d)    Animated and Moving Signs. Animated, flashing, blinking, reflecting, revolving, or other similar signs, or signs with visibly moving or rotating parts or visible mechanical movement of any kind, are generally discouraged unless they add appropriate visual interest compatible with their surroundings.

A proposal for a wireless communications facility shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director, in consultation with the Chief Building Official, Fire Marshal and Public Works Director, for conformance with the provisions of this article pursuant to the zoning compliance review procedures in Article 3 of Chapter 7. If, after the receipt of a complete application, the Community Development Director determines that the proposal conforms to the requirements of this article, a zoning compliance approval shall be issued within the time frames set in the applicable Federal and/or State law, less ten (10) calendar days. If the Community Development Director determines that the application does not conform to the requirements of this article, a zoning compliance approval shall not be issued, and the applicant shall be advised as to how the proposal could be brought into compliance. The Community Development Director’s determination of compliance or noncompliance may be appealed to a hearing officer pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(b)    Waiver of Regulations. If applicant contends that denial of the application would prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of service in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violate applicable law, applicant may request a waiver of the applicable provision or requirement it contends would cause such violation. The application must provide all information on which the applicant relies in support of that claim. Applicants are not permitted to supplement this showing if doing so would prevent the City from complying with any time frame for action on an application. The Community Development Director may grant or deny a request for a waiver pursuant to this subsection. The Community Development Director may grant a request for waiver if it is demonstrated that, notwithstanding the issuance of a waiver, the City will be provided all information necessary to understand the nature of the construction or other activity to be conducted pursuant to the permit sought. All waivers granted pursuant to this subsection shall be (1) granted only on a case-by-case basis, and (2) narrowly tailored to minimize deviation from the requirements of this article and other applicable City regulations. The Community Development Director’s granting or denial of a waiver may be appealed to a hearing officer pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(c)    Review of Community Development Director’s Determination. The applicant, the owner of the property, or any person aggrieved by the determination may appeal the Community Development Director’s determination made under either subsection (a) or (b) of this section to a hearing officer appointed by the City Manager by filing an appeal with the City Clerk within three (3) days of notice of the Community Development Director’s determination. In the event that the appeal period ends on a Saturday, Sunday or City holiday, the appeal period shall end at the close of business on the next City business day. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in the matter appealed, including, but not limited to, the issuance of building permits and business licenses. The appeal shall identify the determination being appealed, shall clearly and concisely state the reasons for the appeal, and include any relevant evidence or legal argument. When reviewing a determination on appeal, the hearing officer shall use the same standards for decision-making required for the original decision. The hearing officer may re-affirm, modify or reject the original determination. The hearing officer’s decision is final, subject only to judicial review. The hearing officer shall render his or her decision so that the final decision is issued within the time frames set in the applicable Federal and/or State law.

(4)    Failure to comply with co-location requirements when feasible or cooperate in good faith as provided for in this subsection is grounds for denial of a permit request or revocation of an existing permit.

(b)    If an applicant proposes a wireless communications facility which is not co-located with an existing wireless communications facility, the applicant shall provide an inventory of existing wireless communications facilities within one quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed site, including area which falls in a neighboring jurisdiction, and the applicant shall also provide an explanation as to why the proposed wireless communications facility cannot be co-located with an existing facility.

(c)    In addition to any other requirements, all wireless communications facilities applications shall, at a minimum, include the following information:

(1)    Report on Alternatives. A report explaining why the wireless communications facility is needed at the requested location. Any applicant seeking to construct a new transmission tower shall explain why co-location or location on another kind of support structure is not feasible, including efforts made to develop such an alternative. If the City has requested that the applicant co-locate its wireless communications facility on a site, the applicant shall explain why co-location is not feasible.

(2)    Wireless Communications Facility Plans. Plans shall include a fully dimensioned diagram of the proposed wireless communications facility, including height, shape, size and type of construction. Plans for a transmission tower must include information demonstrating that the structure will be able to accommodate at least one (1) other similar telecommunications provider. A diagram showing the separation between the proposed wireless communications facility and any existing facility or facilities on the same support structure or site is required if co-location is planned.

(3)    Site Plans. A fully dimensioned site/landscaping plan that includes: specific placement of the proposed tower, equipment shelters, and any other wireless telecommunications facility on the site; elevation drawings; setbacks from lot lines; the location of existing structures, trees, and other significant site features; notation of those features proposed to be removed; the type and locations of plant materials proposed to screen the facility; and the proposed materials and colors for the facility.

(4)    Visual Analysis. Photo-simulations showing views of the proposed wireless communications facility from surrounding residential properties and public rights-of-way at varying distances with a map indicating the locations used for the analysis and their distances from the site.

(5)    Documentation of Compliance. Copies of all applicable licenses or other approvals required by the FCC and any other agency with authority to regulate wireless communications facilities, including documentation of compliance with all conditions imposed in conjunction with such licenses or approvals, shall be provided. If these do not include an estimate of the anticipated radio frequency emissions, the applicant shall provide this separately.

(6)    Gap in Coverage. The applicant shall provide evidence to establish that the proposed wireless communications facility is necessary to fill a gap in coverage.

(7)    Owner’s Permission. If the applicant is not the owner of the property, the applicant shall furnish evidence of the property owner’s permission to install, construct and maintain the proposed wireless communications facility. For wireless communications facilities proposed to be located in the public right-of-way or on other City property located in the public right-of-way, the applicant shall submit a copy of the applicable City standard encroachment agreement signed by the applicant.

Article 19.    Development Impact Fees


9-5.1901 Authority and Reference to This Article.

This article may be referred to as the “Impact Fee Ordinance,” and is adopted pursuant to the authority of Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. (hereinafter “Mitigation Fee Act”), California Government Code Section 65000 et seq. (the planning and zoning law of the State of California), and in accordance with the findings set forth in the ordinance codified in this article.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1902 Purpose of Fees.

Pursuant to this article, the City has established fees which will be imposed upon projects for the purpose of mitigating the impacts that the projects have upon the City’s ability to provide public facilities.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1903 Use of Fees.

(a) The fees imposed by the City pursuant to this article, including any interest earning thereon, shall be used to pay, in whole or in part, the estimated reasonable cost of providing specified public facilities, as described in implementing resolutions; to reimburse the City for the cost of specified public facilities constructed by the City with funds from other sources; and to make reimbursement payments in accordance with Section 9-5.1915.

(b) As described in each implementing resolution, the specified public facilities will be categorized into separate and distinct sets of public facilities based upon the type of public facility to be provided, or other identifying features. Each separate set of specified public facilities described in an implementing resolution shall be referred to in this chapter as a “public facility category.” Public facility categories include, but are not limited to: transportation and park and recreation facilities.

(c) For each separate public facility category, a separate fee shall be calculated and imposed, and each separately imposed fee shall be collected by the City and deposited in a separate and distinct “fee fund,” subject to the accounting requirements of the Mitigation Fee Act.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1904 Calculation of Fees by Implementing Resolutions.

Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, in any action establishing, increasing, or imposing a fee as a condition of approval of a project, a technical report shall be prepared for each public facility category, subject to City Council approval by implementing resolution.

Each implementing resolution shall include the following:

(a) Identify the purpose of the fee by identifying the estimated types and quantities of projects subject to the fee, and the public facility category to be funded by the fees.

(b) Identify the use of the fee by identifying the specified public facilities to be funded by the fees.

(c) Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the City’s use of the fee and the types of projects on which the fee is to be imposed by demonstrating how the project will benefit from the specified public facilities to be funded by the fees.

(d) Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the specified public facilities and the types of projects on which the fee is to be imposed, be demonstrating how the project creates a demand for the construction of the specified public facilities to be funded by the fees.

(e) Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the specified public facility attributable to the project on which the fee is to be imposed. This shall include two (2) elements: (1) a quantification of the estimated reasonable cost of providing the specified public facility, which may include the estimated costs of land acquisition, design, construction, construction administration, general administration (including establishment and enforcement) of the fee program, and contingencies; and (2) an identification of the method by which the City quantified the proportionate responsibility of each project for the cost of the specified public facilities, which may be satisfied by establishing a formula which reasonably quantifies the proportionate responsibility of various types of projects using standardized units of measurement.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1905 Obligation to Pay Fees.

(a) Each applicant for City approval of a project (including applications for a change of use and remodels) shall pay impact fees to the City, in accordance with the amounts set forth in implementing resolutions, unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Director, entitlement to a fee adjustment pursuant to Section 9-5.1908, a fee exemption pursuant to Section 9-5.1909, or approval of a fee credit pursuant to Section 9-5.1913.

(b) The obligation to pay impact fees pursuant to this article shall not replace an applicant’s obligation to mitigate development project impacts in accordance with other requirements of State or local law, or to otherwise comply with applicable City site development standards (Chapter 4 of Title 9 of the Planning Regulations), Citywide use and development regulations (Chapter 5 of Title 9 of the Planning Regulations), or subdivision requirements (Chapter 6 of Title 9 of the Planning Regulations).

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1906 Timing of Payment.

(a) At Permit Issuance. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fees for each project shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of the permit required for that project.

(b) After Permit Issuance. Upon application by an applicant, and approval by the Director, the fees for a project may be paid as follows:

(1) For projects that include residential dwelling units, if application of this subsection (b)(1) is specifically requested by the applicant, fees shall be paid before: (a) final inspection, or (b) issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. The amount of the fee to be paid shall be the amount of the fee in effect on the date of permit issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director may deny the application to defer payment of fees for a residential project that does not meet the criteria set forth in California Government Code Section 66007(b)(2)(A) pertaining to lower income affordable housing, and thus require the earlier payment of fees only if the criteria set forth in California Government Code Section 66007(b)(1) is satisfied.

(2) For any nonresidential project, fees shall be paid in their entirety on a date before the project receives (a) its final inspection, or (b) its certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. However, the amount of the fee to be paid for a project shall be the amount of the fee in effect, pursuant to implementing resolution, at the time that full payment is made to the City.

(c) Implementation. The Director shall develop an application form for applicants to request payment of fees after permit issuance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and shall establish departmental guidelines for approval or denial of such applications.

The Director is authorized to execute and approve an application under this subsection (c).

(d) Compliance. No City official may issue a permit with respect to a project unless the fees required by this article have been paid as required by subsection (a) of this section or an application meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section has been approved by the Director in connection with the project. No City official may certify final inspection or issue a certificate of occupancy for a project, or otherwise allow occupancy of a project, until the fees required by this article with respect to such project are paid in accordance with this section.

(Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-008, eff. Aug. 14, 2014)


9-5.1907 Amount of Payment.

(a) The amount of any fee to be paid for a project shall be the amount of the fee in effect, pursuant to implementing resolution, on the date of permit issuance. However, for any project besides one covered by Section 9-5.1906(b)(1), if any fee is paid after the date of permit issuance in accordance with an application approved by the Director pursuant to Section 9-5.1906(c), then the amount of the fee shall be the amount in effect, pursuant to implementing resolution, at the time that full payment is made to the City.

(b)    The amount of any fee to be paid in connection with a change of use shall be: (1) the amount of the fee required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for the proposed use, (2) minus a credit for the amount of the fee for the last legal use of the existing structure pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, whether or not such fee was actually paid. This credit shall not apply to the affordable housing impact fee required by Article 4 of this chapter.

(c) The amount of any fee to be paid in connection with a remodel shall be the amount of the fee required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for that portion of the remodel which generates impacts greater than the last legal use of the existing structure.

(d) In the event that the land use of a project is not included in the implementing resolution for determination of the amount of the fee, the Director shall determine their fee as set forth in the implementing resolution.

9-5.1908 Fee Adjustments by the City.

The City reserves the right to update and adjust each fee from time to time, in accordance with the Mitigation Fee Act. The fee in effect at the time any applicant has obtained a vested development right shall be subject to adjustment by the City, as incorporated in updated implementing resolutions in effect at the time that full payment of the fee is made, based upon any or all of the following criteria:

(a) Adjustments in the amount of the estimated construction costs of providing the specified public facilities based upon adjustments in accordance with the inflation index.

(b) Adjustments to replace estimated costs with actual costs (including carrying costs) of providing the specified public facilities.

(c) Adjustments to reflect more accurate cost estimates of providing the specified public facilities based upon more detailed analysis or design of the previously identified specified public facilities.

9-5.1909 Exemptions.

(a) Residential projects are exempt from impact fees for any remodel, as long as it does not result in a change of use.

9-5.1910 Request for Refund.

An applicant may request a refund of a fee previously paid in accordance with this article, and the Director may approve said refund, only if the applicant provides written documentation to the satisfaction of the Director that: (a) the permit (including and planning permit or City approval on which the fee was imposed) is canceled or voided, and (b) work has not progressed on the permit which would allow commencement of a new use or change of use, and (c) the City has not already committed the fees to the construction of public facilities.

9-6.204 Tentative Maps: Accompanying Data and Reports.

The tentative map shall be accompanied by the following data and reports as may be required by the Planning and Building Director or City Engineer:

(a)    Title Report. A preliminary title report, showing the legal owners at the time of filing the tentative map, shall be submitted with the tentative map.

(b)    Soils Report. The Planning and Building Director or City Engineer may require the preparation of a preliminary soils report. If a preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, could lead to structural defects, the soils report accompanying the final map shall contain an investigation of each lot within the subdivision. The Director or City Engineer may require additional information or reject the report if it is found to be incomplete, inaccurate or unsatisfactory. The preliminary soils report may be waived if the Director or City Engineer determines that, due to knowledge of the soil qualities in the subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary.

(c)    Geotechnical Report. A geotechnical report that evaluates seismic hazards and recommends appropriate mitigation measures, prepared in compliance with the requirements of the State Seismic Hazard Mapping Act, shall be submitted with the tentative map. The report shall identify mitigation measures that will be incorporated in design of the subdivision to mitigate hazards from liquefaction and other seismic hazards subject to approval by the Planning and Building Director.

(d)    Environmental Site Assessment. The Planning and Building Director or City Engineer may require the preparation of a Phase I environmental site assessment to determine the probable existence of any hazardous waste on the property, including contamination of soil, groundwater, or surface water. Such report shall be based on reasonably available knowledge of the property, including, but not limited to, historical use of the property, prior releases, visual and other surveys, records, consultant reports, and regulatory agency correspondence. The exact form and content of the report shall be as specified by the Director or City Engineer. If the report concludes that hazardous waste may exist on the property, further evaluation and/or remediation may be required as a condition of approval of the tentative map.

(e)    Environmental Review Information. The subdivider shall provide additional data and information and pay such fees as may be required for the preparation and processing of environmental documents pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.

(f)    Other Reports. Any other data or reports deemed necessary by the Planning and Building Director and/or the City Engineer shall be submitted with the tentative map.

9-6.205 Vesting Tentative Maps.

(a)    Applicability.

(1)    Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by these subdivision regulations, requires the filing of a tentative map, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(2)    If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by a vesting tentative map, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction.

(3)    No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose that is inconsistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, or not permitted by this title or other applicable provisions of the Municipal Code.

(b)    Procedures.

(1)    Filing and Processing. A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this article for a tentative map, except as follows:

a.    At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map.”

b.    In addition to the data and reports required by Section 9-6.204, a vesting tentative map shall be accompanied by the following plans and reports when deemed necessary by the Planning and Building Director:

i.    Grading plans prepared in accordance with City standards, including, but not limited to, the grading regulations of Chapter 5 of Title 7 and the building regulations in Title 8.

ii.    Structural plans for any development proposed to be constructed on the subdivided property in compliance with the building regulations in Title 8.

iii.    Energy calculations for any development proposed to be constructed on the subdivided property in compliance with the building regulations in Title 8.

c.    A subdivider shall obtain all discretionary approvals that will be required under this title in conjunction with the approval or conditional approval of the vesting tentative map in order to construct the development including, but not limited to, General Plan amendments, zoning changes, conditional use permits, variances, and design review. An application for a vesting tentative map shall be determined to be incomplete if other required discretionary permit applications have not been submitted at the same time.

d.    Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required by the City for the filing and processing of a tentative map as set forth in the Master Fee Schedule.

(2)    Applications Inconsistent with Zoning. If the City determines that a vesting tentative map is inconsistent with the zoning of the property, the City may deny the vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary zoning changes to eliminate the inconsistency. If the necessary zoning changes are obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the zoning changes as approved.

(c)    Vesting of Development Rights. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time that the application is determined to be complete by the City pursuant to California Government Code Section 66474.2, subject to the following:

(1)    Any fees required for development under an approved vesting tentative map shall be payable at the rates in effect at the time such fees are due.

(2)    A subsequent permit, approval, extension, building permit, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied pursuant to later ordinances, policies and standards if any of the following are determined:

a.    A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community in a condition dangerous to their health or safety.

b.    The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with State or Federal law.

(d)    Expiration and Extension.

(1)    The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same period, and shall be subject to the same extensions that this article establishes for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map.

(2)    Following the recording of a final map, the vested development rights shall last for the following periods of time:

a.    An initial time period of two (2) years beyond the recording of the final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

b.    The initial time period set forth in subsection (d)(2)(a) of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for discretionary approvals for the proposed development, including, but not limited to, General Plan amendments, zoning changes, conditional use permits, variances, design review or grading permits if such processing exceeds thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is filed.

(3)    A subdivider may apply to the Planning Commission for a one (1) year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection (d)(2)(a) of this section expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the City Council pursuant to Article 14 of Chapter 7.

(4)    If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit prior to the expiration of the final map, the development rights shall continue until the expiration of such building permit or the expiration of any extension of that permit.

The affected public agencies and utilities may, in turn, forward to the Director their findings and recommendations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-6.207 Tentative Maps: Review by City Engineer.

The City Engineer shall review the form and contents of the tentative map and accompanying data and reports pursuant to the requirements of this chapter and any additional requirements established by the City Engineer, and shall convey his or her comments to the subdivider’s engineer or surveyor. The subdivider’s engineer or surveyor shall make corrections and/or additions until the map is acceptable to the City Engineer.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-6.208 Tentative Maps: Planning Commission Action.

(a)    Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on a tentative map pursuant to the Section 66451.3 of the Subdivision Map Act and the requirements of the common procedures in Article 2 of Chapter 7. The Planning and Building Director shall prepare and distribute a staff report pursuant to Section 66452.3 of the Subdivision Map Act, including distribution of the staff report at least three (3) days prior to the hearing to the subdivider and, in the case of a proposed conversion of residential real property to a condominium project, community apartment project, or stock cooperative project, to each tenant of the subject property.

(b)    Action Required. After conducting a public hearing, the Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny a tentative map within fifty (50) days after certification of an environmental impact report, adoption of a negative declaration or determination that the project is exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.

(c)    Findings. A tentative map may be approved or conditionally approved only if all of the following findings are made:

(1)    Consistency. The proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the General Plan, any applicable specific plan or area plan, these subdivision regulations, this title, and other applicable provisions of the Emeryville Municipal Code.

(2)    Lot Width, Area, and Design. The proposed lots are of such width, area, and design as the Commission finds to be necessary to preserve the purpose and intent of this chapter and these planning regulations.

(3)    Passive or Natural Heating and Cooling. The design of the subdivision will provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural heating and cooling features in accordance with Section 66473.1 of the Subdivision Map Act.

(4)    Availability of Water. Water will be available and sufficient to serve a proposed subdivision with more than five hundred (500) dwelling units in accordance with Section 66473.7 of the Subdivision Map Act.

(5)    Site Suitability. The site is physically suitable for the type and density of development proposed.

(6)    Fish and Wildlife. The design of the subdivision and the proposed improvements are not likely to cause substantial environmental damage or to substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.

(7)    Public Health. The design of the subdivision and the type of improvements are not likely to cause serious public health problems.

(8)    Easements. The design of the subdivision and the type of improvements will not conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. The Planning Commission or City Council, acting on an appeal, may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements for access or for use will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to easements previously acquired by the public. This shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is granted to the Planning Commission or City Council to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.

(9)    Sewers. The waste discharge into the City sewer system from the proposed subdivision would not add to, or result in, violations of requirements of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the City’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, or other restrictions of the sanitary sewer collection system imposed on the City.

(d)    Exceptions. Exceptions to the standards set forth in this chapter may be approved if all of the following findings are made:

(1)    That the strict application of any such standard would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

(2)    That there are exceptional circumstances or conditions applicable to the property being subdivided or to its intended use or development.

(3)    That the granting of the exception will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to the property being subdivided or to improvements in the immediate vicinity.

(e)    Conditions of Approval. Conditions necessary to make the findings required by this section or to meet the requirement of these planning regulations or the Subdivision Map Act may be imposed on the approval of a tentative map, including, but not limited to, the following:

(1)    Recommendations of Public Agencies and Utilities. Conditions related to any recommendations of affected public agencies and utilities submitted pursuant to Section 9-6.206(b) may be imposed on the tentative map.

(2)    Joint Use. A condition may be imposed, when applicable, requiring agreements for the joint use of portions of private streets and driveways, including areas to be landscaped and jointly maintained.

(3)    Indemnification.

(a)    General Provisions.

(1)    There is hereby established a joint planning authority, to be known as the Emeryville/Oakland Joint Planning Authority (“the E/OJPA”), which shall have jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of this section, over the Catellus Development Corporation (“CDC”) project (“project”) on the CDC property (“property”), as both are more specifically described in Ordinance No. 92-07, a copy of which is on file in the office of the Emeryville City Clerk. The E/OJPA planning area lies within the cities of Emeryville and Oakland, and is generally bounded by 40th Street on the north; San Pablo Avenue on the east; West MacArthur Boulevard, Hollis Street, and Mandela Parkway on the south; and Beach Street on the west.

(2)    The E/OJPA shall consist of a Planning Council and an Appellate Council. The Planning Council shall be comprised of six (6) members of the Emeryville Planning Commission and seven (7) members of the Oakland Planning Commission. The Appellate Council shall be comprised of four (4) members of the Emeryville City Council and three (3) members of the Oakland City Council.

(3)    The Planning Council shall have jurisdiction to take final action on behalf of the Joint Planning Authority; provided, however, that if any such action is appealed, the Appellate Council shall render the final decision on any such appeal.

(4)    The Mayor, subject to approval of the City Council, shall designate the members of the Emeryville Planning Commission and the Emeryville City Council who shall serve on the Planning Council and the Appellate Council, respectively. Such members shall continue to serve on the Joint Planning Authority for so long as they continue to hold the position on the Planning Commission or City Council from which they were originally appointed, until their voluntary resignation from the Joint Planning Authority, until replaced by a substitute member appointed by the Mayor or until the Joint Planning Authority shall no longer exist.

(b)    Term of the E/OJPA. The E/OJPA shall exist for an initial term of five (5) years after its establishment, and shall thereafter automatically be renewed for successive five (5) year terms, unless terminated by the unilateral action of the City Council of either Emeryville or Oakland within sixty (60) days prior to the end of any term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cities may terminate the Joint Planning Authority at any time after the initial term by their mutual agreement.

(c)    Powers of the E/OJPA.

(1)    Except as hereinafter set forth, the City of Emeryville hereby delegates to the E/OJPA the power to exercise all of Emeryville’s planning and subdivision power and authority under the Emeryville Municipal Code and California State laws in relation to the E/OJPA planning area, including, but not limited to, findings of General Plan and zoning consistency, granting of rezonings, design review, variances, conditional use permits, subdivision of the property and hearing and ruling upon all other land use and related authorizations necessary for the construction of the project.

(2)    In compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, Emeryville has heretofore been deemed the “lead agency” and Oakland has acted as a “responsible agency” pursuant to California Administrative Code Title 14, Section 15051, in the preparation of the draft environmental impact report and certification of the final environmental impact report for the project. Emeryville shall, therefore, continue to function as the lead agency and Oakland shall continue to function as a responsible agency for any subsequent environmental review that may be required for the property.

(3)    For so long as the Joint Planning Authority shall continue to exist pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of the property may not divide or subdivide the site or otherwise substantially modify the approvals granted by the Joint Planning Authority, without further approval of the Joint Planning Authority.

(d)    Procedures.

(1)    Meetings of the E/OJPA shall be convened as necessary for the consideration of those matters which are within the jurisdiction of the E/OJPA.

(2)    All meetings of the E/OJPA shall comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act and other State laws regulating the conduct of business by city councils in California. Public notice of meetings of the E/OJPA shall comply with the requirements of the Emeryville Municipal Code and shall, in addition, comply with the Oakland Municipal Code with respect to the owners of land within Oakland in the vicinity of the property.

(3)    The location of meetings of the E/OJPA shall be determined by the Chair of the Planning Council and the Appellate Council, respectively; provided, that reasonable effort shall be made to alternate meetings of each body between locations within Emeryville and Oakland.

(4)    Minutes of all meetings and appropriate legislation of the E/OJPA shall be public documents pursuant to State law and shall be appropriately maintained in the office of the City Clerk of Emeryville.

(5)    The E/OJPA shall adopt and implement all regulations which may be necessary for the performance of its obligations under the terms and conditions of this article and the memorandum of understanding between Emeryville and Oakland regarding the E/OJPA.

(e)    Appeals.

(1)    Any person or entity aggrieved or affected by a determination or decision by the Planning Council may appeal the determination or decision to the Appellate Council. Such appeal shall be taken by filing a written notice of appeal with the Emeryville City Manager within fifteen (15) days after the determination or decision of the E/OJPA. The notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds upon which the appeal is based. The notice of appeal shall also be accompanied by a fee in the amount established by applicable resolutions of the City of Emeryville for appeals to the City Council from the Emeryville Planning Commission.

(2)    The Appellate Council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or determination appealed from the Planning Council.

(3)    Decisions of the Appellate Council shall be final and shall be subject to the time limits and procedures provided for in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1086 and 1094.6 for such actions to which Sections 1086 and 1094.6, respectively, are applicable.

(f)    Remedies. All legislative and quasi-judicial decisions of the Planning Council and Appellate Council shall be subject to all remedies provided by State law including, but not limited to, referendum and writ of mandamus; provided, however, that any writ of mandamus shall be filed within ninety (90) days of the decision unless State law provides for a shorter limitation period.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.212 Effective Date.

A final decision on an application for any discretionary approval subject to appeal shall become effective after the expiration of the fifteen (15) day appeal period following the date of action, unless an appeal is filed pursuant to Article 14 of this chapter.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.213 Expiration and Extension.

(a)    Unless the Planning Commission or City Council specifies otherwise pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, any design review approval, conditional use permit, variance or exception to standards granted in accordance with the terms of these planning regulations shall automatically expire unless an application for a building permit has been filed and fees have been paid within one (1) year from the date of final approval, or, if a building permit is not required, a good faith effort to commence work upon the use has been made, as determined by the Director in his or her sole discretion. If a building permit is issued but expires with no work being done, then the associated planning permit shall also expire unless extended pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such extension may not exceed three (3) years from the planning permit’s original approval date.

(b)    In approving any design review approval, conditional use permit, variance or exception to standards the Director, Planning Commission, or City Council may grant an initial expiration period of up to two (2) years from the date of final approval upon the applicant’s request. Such lengthened expiration period, and the actual expiration date, shall be specified in the conditions of approval.

(c)    An applicant may request time extensions not exceeding one (1) year by applying to the original decision-maker(s) prior to the expiration date of the permit. In the case of one (1) year approvals, two (2) such extensions may be allowed. In the case of two (2) year approvals, one (1) such extension may be allowed. In no case shall a permit be extended beyond three (3) years from its original approval date. After that time, a new application shall be required.

(d)    The Director shall refer an extension request to the Public Works Director, Fire Chief, and Police Chief for their review and recommendation prior to action being taken on the extension request.

(e)    In order for an extension to be granted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, all of the following findings must be made:

(1)    The permit holder has clearly documented that it has made a good faith effort to commence work upon the use.

(2)    It is in the best interest of the City to extend the permit.

(3)    There are no substantial changes to the project, no substantial changes to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken, and no new information of substantial importance that would require any further environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.

(4)    The permit holder is maintaining the property in compliance with all applicable City regulations.

(f)    In granting an extension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the decision-maker(s) may modify the conditions of approval as it deems necessary in order to fulfill the purposes of these planning regulations.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.214 Modifications.

(a)    Minor Modifications. The Director may approve minor modifications to approved plans or conditions of approval that are substantially consistent with the original findings and conditions of approval and would not intensify any potentially detrimental effects of the project.

(b)    Major Modifications. Modifications to approved plans or conditions of approval that are not deemed minor by the Director require the approval of the original decision-maker(s). Any person holding a permit granted under these planning regulations may apply for such modification by following the same procedure required for the initial application for the permit. Such modifications may be to the terms of the permit itself or to conditions of approval.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.216 Denied Applications.

Whenever an application for any type of permit under these planning regulations has been denied, no application for essentially the same proposal affecting the same property, or any portion thereof, shall be filed within one (1) year after the date of denial. This shall not apply in instances where the applicant can show changed circumstances sufficient to justify a new application. Whether or not a new application is justified shall be determined by the Director, whose decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission pursuant to Article 14 of this chapter.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.217 Legal Considerations.

(a)    Indemnification. Applicant, its assignees, and successors-in-interest shall defend, hold harmless, and indemnify the City of Emeryville, the City of Emeryville as successor agency to the redevelopment agency, the Bay Cities Joint Powers Insurance Authority and their respective officials, officers, agents and employees (the indemnified parties) against all claims, demands, and judgments or other forms of legal and or equitable relief, which may or shall result from: (1) any legal challenge or referendum filed and prosecuted to overturn, set aside, stay or otherwise rescind any or all final project or zoning approvals, analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act or granting of any permit issued in accordance with the project; or (2) applicant’s design, construction and/or maintenance of the public improvements set forth in the final building plans. Applicant shall pay for all direct and indirect costs associated with any action herein. Direct and indirect costs as used herein shall mean but not be limited to attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, and court costs including, without limitation, City Attorney time and overhead costs and other City staff overhead costs and normal day-to-day business expenses incurred by the City including, but not limited to, any and all costs which may be incurred by the City in conducting an election as a result of a referendum filed to challenge the project approvals. The indemnified parties shall promptly notify the applicant, its assignees, and successors-in-interest of any claim, demand, or legal actions that may create a claim for indemnification under this section and shall fully cooperate with applicant, its assignees and successors-in-interest.

(b)    Irregularity in Proceedings. No action, inaction or recommendation regarding any application under these planning regulations shall be held void or invalid or be set aside by a court by reason of any error, irregularity, informality, neglect or omission (“error”) as to any matter pertaining to petition, application, notice, finding, record, hearing, report, recommendation, or any matters of procedure whatever unless, after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, the court is of the opinion that the error complained of was prejudicial and that by reason of the error the complaining party sustained and suffered substantial injury and that a different result would have been probable if the error had not occurred or existed. There is no presumption that error was prejudicial or that injury was done if error was shown.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)

Article 7.    Variances


9-7.701 Purpose.

This article is intended to provide a mechanism for relief from the strict application of these planning regulations where strict application would deprive the property owner of privileges enjoyed by owners of similar properties because of the property’s unique and special conditions.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.702 Applicability.

A variance may be granted with respect to dimensional and performance standards, except that certain minor exceptions to standards may be granted pursuant to Article 8 of this chapter, Exceptions to Standards. A variance may not be granted to authorize a use that is not otherwise authorized by these planning regulations, nor may a variance be granted from any standard that is based on requirements of the General Plan, including, but not limited to, floor area ratio, height, or residential density. A deviation from such a General Plan standard requires a General Plan amendment pursuant to Article 12 of this chapter. Personal, family or financial difficulties, loss of prospective profits, and neighboring violations are not hardships justifying a variance. Further, a previous variance can never have set a precedent because each case must be considered only on its individual merits.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.703 Procedures.

An application for a variance shall be considered by the Planning Commission and shall be filed and processed in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of this chapter, Common Procedures, including conditions of approval, expiration, extensions, and modifications. In addition to any other application requirements, an application for a variance shall include data or other evidence demonstrating that:

(a)    There are special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property, such as size, shape, topography, location, surroundings, or existing structures, which do not apply generally to uses, land or structures in the vicinity and in the same zoning district.

(b)    Due to the special circumstances applicable to this property, strict application of the regulation from which a variance is sought would deprive the property owner of privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the same zoning district.

(c)    Special circumstances applicable to the property were or are not self-imposed by the property owner.

(d)    Authorization of the variance would substantially meet the intent and purpose of the zoning district in which the subject property is located and would not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of persons living or working in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.704 Findings.

To grant a variance, all of the following findings must be made:

(a)    The proposal for which the variance is sought is consistent with the General Plan.

(b)    Because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of these planning regulations would deprive the property owner of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other property in the vicinity and in the same zoning district.

(c)    The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other conforming property in the vicinity and in the same zoning district and the variance, if granted, would not constitute a special privilege of the recipient inconsistent with limitations on other properties in the vicinity and in the same zoning district.

(d)    Granting the variance would not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare and would not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property.

(e)    The conditions upon which the requested variance is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property in the same zoning district.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.705 Appeals.

The Planning Commission’s decision on a variance may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to Article 14 of this chapter.

Article 8.    Exceptions to Standards


9-7.801 Purpose.

This article is intended to provide a means of granting relief from the requirements of these planning regulations for minor deviations from dimensional and design standards when strict application would preclude an effective design solution improving livability, operational efficiency, or appearance, and fulfilling the basic intent of the applicable regulation.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.802 Applicability.

Exceptions to standards may be granted for:

(a)    Minimum yards in the residential zones, up to one-third (1/3) of the required setback.

(b)    Maximum height of fences and freestanding walls in the residential zones.

(c)    Minimum landscaping, up to ten percent (10%) of required landscaping for sites or parking lots.

(d)    Parking space dimensions, up to five percent (5%) of length and/or width for no more than ten percent (10%) of spaces.

(e)    Individual establishment sign dimensions up to five percent (5%) of any linear dimension or ten percent (10%) of any area dimension; provided, that the maximum aggregate sign area for the establishment is not exceeded.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.803 Procedures.

An application for an exception to standards shall be considered by the Director and shall be filed and processed in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of this chapter, Common Procedures, including conditions of approval, expiration, extensions, and modifications. An exception to standards application that is combined with another permit application that requires Planning Commission or City Council approval shall be acted upon by the Commission or Council concurrently with the other permit application.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013)


9-7.804 Findings.

To grant an exception to standards, all of the following findings must be made:

(a)    The proposal for which the exception is sought is consistent with the General Plan.

(b)    Strict compliance with these planning regulations would preclude an effective design solution improving livability, operational efficiency, or appearance.

(c)    The proposal for which the exception is sought would fulfill the basic intent of the applicable regulation.

(d)    The proposal for which the exception is sought would comply with the applicable design review criteria at Section 9-7.406.

(e)    The proposal for which the exception is sought would be compatible with, and would not adversely affect, the surrounding area, and would not be detrimental to the health or safety of the public or the occupants of the property.

(Sec. 2 (Exh. A) (part), Ord. 13-001, eff. Mar. 7, 2013; Sec. 3 (part), Ord. 14-001, eff. Mar. 6, 2014)

Article 9.    Reasonable Accommodation


9-7.901 Purpose.

It is the policy of the City of Emeryville to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to provide reasonable accommodation by modifying the application of its zoning and subdivision regulations for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing.

(b)    Unless otherwise specified in a development agreement, the City Manager shall provide thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of such periodic review to the developer. Such notice shall require the developer to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement and to provide such other information as may be reasonably requested by the City Manager and deemed by him or her to be required in order to ascertain compliance with the development agreement. Such notice shall also include the statement that any review may result in amendment or termination of the development agreement.

(g)    Failure of the City to conduct a periodic review shall not constitute a waiver by the City of its rights to enforce the provisions of a development agreement, nor shall a developer have or assert any defense to such enforcement by reason of such failure to conduct a periodic review.

CHAPTER 2. ACTIVITIES IN THE TIDELANDS WITHIN THE CITY OF EMERYVILLE

Sections:

10-2.01    Purpose and Intent

10-2.02    Definitions

10-2.03    No Fishing, Boating, Access or Recreation within Parcel A of the Tidelands

10-2.04    Permitted Activities within Parcel B of the Tidelands

10-2.06    Exemption for Law Enforcement and Emergency Operations

10-2.07    Penalties for Violation


10-2.01 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose and intent of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to codify the City’s exercise of the public trust over the tidelands pursuant to City of Emeryville Resolution No. 89-31 enacted on May 2, 1989. This chapter also provides for specific restrictions on personal watercraft within the trust tidelands, in accordance with the City’s exercise of the public trust. The restrictions on personal watercraft are imposed in order to eliminate adverse impacts to the diverse and unusual floral and faunal species found within the tidelands of the City of Emeryville; to reduce existing and potential conflicts between uses of the tidelands; to promote overall public safety; and to reduce the nuisance impact from the noise and waves generated by personal watercraft on neighbors of the tidelands. These additional regulations on personal watercraft are necessary because of the nature and design of personal watercraft: high maneuverability, high speed, ability to travel in shallow areas and unique and annoying noise patterns.
