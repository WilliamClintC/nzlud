application, and to this end the provisions are severable.



§ 10.11  REFERENCE TO PUBLIC OFFICE OR OFFICER.



   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the village exercising the powers, duties, or

functions or change in the official title of the functionary. Such references

word or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the
intention of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no
meaning can be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or
words was clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be
corrected, and the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will
conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same
effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as originally
published.  No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists
regarding the nature or extent of the error.

ordinances, shall remain in full force and effect unless herein repealed
expressly or by necessary implication.



§ 10.15  ORDINANCES SAVED.



   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain village officer or employee to make additional
ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the intent of the
ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature serving that
purpose effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto,
shall remain in effect and are saved.

doing or omission, compensation for such damage, loss, expense, or injury may

issue the alleged violator a compliance or P ticket, as may apply, for the
following:



      (1)   A violation of any section of Title VII of this Code in
relation to which the violation can be rectified by correction of the
violation alleged.

violator may settle and compromise that ticket by paying to the village a fee
of $50 and showing proof of the correction of the violation (i.e.,
replacement of the faulty equipment, purchase of the required license or
permit), if applicable, within ten days from the date such alleged violation
was committed, or by paying to the village the sum of $100, subsequent to the

amends the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, §§ 1 et seq.) to allow
municipalities to adopt rules and procedures that permit appointed and
elected members of boards, commissions and committees to attend, participate
and vote at open and closed public meetings through the use of telephone
conference calls or other electronic means. The corporate authorities of the
village find that it is in the public interest to adopt a set of rules and
procedures that allow appointed and elected members of Village boards,
commissions and committees to attend, participate in and vote at open and
closed public meetings through the use of telephone conference calls or other
electronic means (e.g., video or audio conference).



   (B)   Definitions. The definitions of the terms “MEETING,”
“PUBLIC BODY,” “OTHER MEANS,” “QUORUM” or any other defined term
used in this section, which is also found in the Open Meetings Act, shall
have the same definitions as contained in the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5,
Act 120, SS 1 et seq.), as amended.



   (C)   Rules and procedures.



      (1)   Village boards, committees and commissions must comply
with all of the applicable requirements of the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5,
Act 120, §§ 1 et seq.), as amended.



      (2)   Village boards, committees and commissions are
prohibited from establishing a quorum to conduct business at an open or
closed meeting through the attendance of board members by the use of
telephone conference calls or other electronic means. A quorum of members of
a village board, commission or committee must be physically present at the
location of an open or closed meeting.

§ 31.004  ELECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE ILLINOIS MUNICIPAL RETIREMENT FUND,
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PROGRAM, TERM LIFE INSURANCE, AND HEALTH INSURANCE FOR
ELECTED OFFICIALS.



   (A)     Each elected official of the village may elect to
participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF) pursuant to all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The required employee contribution
to the IMRF shall be a deduction from the compensation due to each elected
official who elects to participate in the IMRF.



   (B)     Commencing on May 1, 1985, each elected village official of
the village shall be entitled to elect to participate in the deferred
compensation plan or program sponsored by the International City Management
Association or the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  Each elected official shall
be entitled to designate in writing to the Village Treasurer what portion (or
all) of his compensation to be paid into a deferred compensation program
together with a designation to which program it should be paid into.
Thereafter, the Village Treasurer shall be entitled to make payments until
that time as the Village Treasurer receives a written direction from an
elected official to either increase or decrease the amount of the payment or
to discontinue making the payments entirely for that official.  The Village
Treasurer shall be entitled to rely upon and act in accordance with any
written designation or direction received from time to time and the village
and the Village Treasurer shall be discharged from any and all liability in
connection therewith.



   (C)     Each elected official of the village shall, effective upon

to participate in the life insurance program offered from time to time by the
village to all full-time employees of the village through the South Towns
Area Benefit Cooperative or any other entity or agency as determined from
time to time by the village.  The village shall pay the entire cost of the
group term life insurance for those elected officials, with the amount of the
insurance to be in the same amount as from time to time provided to the
full-time employees of the village through the village's group term life
insurance program.  This insurance shall be provided on the same terms and
conditions as provided to the village's full-time employees, and shall be
subject to all restrictions and conditions as may be required from time to
time by the insurance carrier and the Cooperative or other entity or agency
providing the program.



   (D)     The village will purchase additional term life insurance
coverage for each elected official of the village with a death benefit of not
less than $20,000; provided, however, if the elected official has elected to
participate in the IMRF, and is provided a greater death benefit through the
IMRF based upon their compensation with the village, or if such term life
insurance benefits provided under division (C) of this section are greater
than the amount referenced in this section, then no such additional life
insurance benefit shall be required, with the death benefits then being
solely provided pursuant to the IMRF or other term life insurance provided
under division (C) of this section. As applicable, the beneficiary, or
beneficiaries, of said insurance shall be designated by the elected official.
This insurance shall be subject to all restrictions and conditions as may be
required from time to time by the insurance provider, as applicable.



   (E)     The village will purchase additional indemnity insurance
coverage for elected officials to provide a maximum death benefit in the
amount of $50,000 for any elected official of the village who dies while in
the act of conducting official village business. As applicable, the
beneficiary or beneficiaries, of said insurance shall be designated by the
elected official. This insurance benefit shall take into consideration the
benefits herein provided under divisions (C) or (D) of this section.
Accordingly, the maximum combined death benefit to be provided under
divisions (C), (D), and (E) of this section, in the case of a death of an
elected official while conducting official village business shall be in the
amount of $50,000. This insurance shall be subject to all restrictions and
conditions as may be required from time to time by the insurance provider, as
applicable.



   (F)     The village maintains comprehensive health and medical
insurance plans on an annual basis for its employees. Each elected official
of the village may choose to participate in the village's health insurance
plan offerings. Any elected official who opts to obtain health insurance
through the village's plans shall pay 20% of the premium cost for such
participation, with the remainder to be paid by the village. These health and
medical insurance benefits may also include dental, vision, and drug coverage
and are subject to change from time to time by the village or the insurance
provider.

occurrence or threat of catastrophic and widespread injury or loss of life to
village residents or property in the village resulting from any natural or
manmade cause, including but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, epidemic
and explosion. The Village President, Mayor Pro Tem, or emergency interim
successor may not exercise the emergency spending authority granted herein
without first declaring that an emergency, as defined above, exists, by
setting forth, in writing and under oath, a declaration of emergency
describing the nature of the emergency and detailing facts to substantiate
such finding. The declaration of emergency shall be filed with the Village
Clerk as soon as is practicable. The declaration of emergency, and concurrent
spending and other authority, shall expire not later than the adjournment of
the first regular meeting of the corporate authorities after the state of
emergency is declared.

(Ord. 2017-O-054, passed 9-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-O-026, passed 5-1-18)



§ 35.06  SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.



   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a
person because of that person’s sex. The courts have determined that sexual
harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in
an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable
misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations.
It is a policy of the Village of Tinley Park to prohibit harassment of any
person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.



   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment.



      (1)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment
as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual
harassment as:



         (a)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for
sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:



            1.    Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,



            2.    Submission to or rejection of such conduct
by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual, or



            3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating
an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.



      (2)   No co-worker, supervisor, department head, manager or
village official has the authority to require you to tolerate or agree to any
conduct that violates this policy in order to receive any job benefit.



      (3)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes
(but is not limited to):



         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits,
sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements
about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.



         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
“catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.



         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a
sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.



         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.



         (e)    Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically
sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use
of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all
forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network
websites like Facebook and Twitter).



      (4)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are
easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment
is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of
what would offend a “reasonable person.”



   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.



      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or
believes herself or himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal
with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her or his position to the offending employee, and her or his
department head, any department head, Village Human Resources or the Village
Manager. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the
person making the report.



      (2)   Any employee must report conduct which is believed to be
sexual harassment, including the following:



         (a)    Electronic/direct communication. If there is
sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should
directly and clearly express her or his objection that the conduct is
unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message
may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in
writing in a note or a memo.



         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel.



            1.   At the same time direct communication is
undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by
the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to, a department head,
the director of human resources, or the Village Manager.



            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she
believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware
of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.



         (c)   Resolution outside municipality.



            1.   The purpose of this policy is to establish
prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and
incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality.
However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois
Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the
alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the
EEOC must be filed within 300 days.



            2.    Documentation of any incident may be
submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the
place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters,
notes, memos and telephone messages.



            3.   All allegations, including anonymous reports,
will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the
attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications
of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their
investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s
willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an
appropriate outcome. All employees are expected and required to cooperate
fully in the investigation process. All matters will be treated with the
utmost discretion and sensitivity to the extent practicable without
compromising the investigation.



   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.



      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal
employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action
against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:



         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any
violation of this policy,



         (b)   The provision of information related to or
testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or
inquiry into any violation of this policy, or



         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to
enforce the provisions of this policy.



      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action
means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or
transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal
employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s
involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy.



      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against
provided a report is made in good faith even if it is not substantiated. In
addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation.



      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained
herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 §
15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or
transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:



         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor
or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member,
state agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably
believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,



         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any
violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency
or other state employee, or



         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce
the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.



      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch.740, Act 174
§ 15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative
commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has
reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or
law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule,
or regulation. (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174 § 15(b)).



      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch.
775, Act 5 § 6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two
or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he or she
has opposed that which he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be
sexual harassment in employment, because he or she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.



      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower
paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR
or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge - due within 189 days (IDHR) or 300
days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.



   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment. In addition to any and all other discipline that may be
applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures,
employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who
violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in
ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 § 5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state
law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from
any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties
imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.



   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.



      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by
an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other
than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual
harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be
proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or
frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary
action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or
discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements,
procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.



      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false
report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State
Police, a state’s attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law
enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission
may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who
intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.



   (G)   This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human
Rights Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to
Public Act 100-0554.

§ 36.06  FUNDS RECEIVED FOR SALE OF REAL PROPERTY.



   From time to time, the village receives funds as the result of the sale
of village-owned real property and/or right-of-way. The Corporate Authorities
of the village find it to be in the best interests of the village to earmark
such funds received for deposit into a specific fund as follows:



   (A)   A "Municipal Real Estate Fund" (the "Fund") shall be
established.



   (B)   The purpose of the Fund is to provide a revolving source of
monies to be available for the purchase of real property by the village.



   (C)   All funds received for the sale of village-owned real
property, net of any costs, expenses, and or charges due to third-parties in
relation to the sale, are to be deposited into the Fund. For purposes of this
policy, real property shall also include any dedicated street or other
right-of-way or any other similar real estate as well as any appurtenances
thereon.



   (D)   Amounts received by the village for the sale of real property
shall be required to be deposited into the Fund regardless of whether the
village-owned real property is sold to a private party, a not-for-profit
organization, or another governmental entity.



   (E)   The village may by ordinance or resolution, from time to time
at its discretion, transfer money into the Fund from any other village funds
established for accounting or reporting purposes.



   (F)   The village may by ordinance or resolution, from time to time
at its discretion, identify or ear-mark other revenue or revenue sources and
provide direction that these monies be deposited to the Fund either on a
one-time, or on-going basis.



   (G)   The Fund is not required to be the sole source of funding for
the purchase of real property by the village, it being understood that from
time to time there may be insufficient amounts in the Fund for the purchase
of a particular property by the village and/or that the Corporate Authorities
may direct that an additional or different source(s) of funds be used for a
particular purchase or series of related purchases.



   (H)   In addition to the purchase price, any related costs,
expenses, and/or charges due to third parties associated with a purchase of
real property by the village may be paid out of the Fund as well.



   (I)   The Corporate Authorities may, by a two-thirds vote, direct
that amounts be removed or transferred from the Fund for a purpose other than
the purchase of real property.



   (J)   All transfers into and out of the Fund pursuant to this
chapter shall be at the direction of the Village Treasurer with the
concurrence of the Finance and Economic Development Committee pursuant to
lawful authority from the Corporate Authorities.



   (K)   The Treasurer shall handle the investment of the amounts
deposited into the Fund pursuant to the village's existing investment policy

ensure that it is being conducted in the public interest. It is further
declared to be the public policy of the Village of Tinley Park that access by
all persons to public records promotes the transparency and accountability of
public bodies at all levels of government, and that it is a fundamental
obligation of government to operate openly and provide public records as
expediently and efficiently as possible in compliance with the Freedom of
Information Act.

business days after receipt. The response shall:

the fees to be charged, which the village may require the person to pay in
full before copying the requested documents;

exemptions set out in the Act;

      (2)   (a)   Within five business days after receiving a

request from a recurrent requester within a reasonable period considering the
size and complexity of the request.



   (I)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category
shall be complied with unless compliance would be unduly burdensome and there
is no way to narrow the request, and the burden on the village outweighs the
public interest in the information. Before involving this exemption, the
Freedom of Information Officer(s) shall extend to the requester an
opportunity to confer in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable
proportions. This communication shall be in writing and shall specify the
reasons why compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome.

all notices of denial in a single central office file that is open to the
public and indexed according to the type of exemption asserted and, to the
extent feasible, according to the types of records requested.



   (L)   If a denial is appealed by the requester to the Public Access
Counselor, the village shall participate in the appeal, if any, and may seek
administrative review of any decision pursuant to the Act.

contemplated law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement

      (2)   Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement
or correctional personnel or any other person; or

   (A)   It is the policy of the village that its employees and elected
and appointed officers should, in all cases, exercise their judgment and
perform their duties with integrity and impartiality and for the sole benefit
of the citizens of the village.  To this end all such persons should avoid
accepting or retaining any economic benefits or opportunities which could
impair or present an actual threat to the exercise of independent judgment or
interfere with serving the public interest.  It is further the policy of
this village that all appearances of impropriety shall be avoided.  It is
further the policy of this village to require disclosure by all officials and
employees of private financial or other interests in matters which may affect
the village.



   (B)   The President and the Board of Trustees of the village do
hereby determine that a policy setting forth ethical principles and
regulations applicable to public officials and employees is in the best
interest of the citizens of the village and will contribute to public
confidence in the integrity, ability and performance of said persons.



(Ord. 96-0-009, passed 2-20-96)



§ 39.02  STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES.

are proud of the privilege of serving the public.

citizens of the village.



   (C)   We affirm the dignity and value of the service that we render,
and strive for the constructive, creative and practical approach to our work
and responsibilities.



   (D)   We dedicate ourselves to the highest ideals of honor and
integrity and the principles of equality for all regardless of race, color,
sex, age, national origin, religion, physical or mental handicap, military
status or unfavorable discharge from military service, and any other
classifications protected by the Illinois Human Rights Act, as amended from
time to time.



   (E)   We believe it is our duty to continually improve our abilities
and skills in order to sustain productive and quality performance.



   (F)   We believe we hold office for the benefit of the public and in
order to serve the public.



   (G)   We emphasize a friendly and courteous attitude and seek to
present a positive image of public service.



   (H)   We respect and treat as privileged information accepted in
trust and believe that all matters of personnel  should  be  handled 
fairly  according  to established rules.



   (I)   We believe that personal gain, either immediate or in the
future, secured by the misuse of one's position is totally unethical and that
our conduct in public affairs must always be above reproach.



   (J)   We believe that public service is a public trust and the
public interest is and must always remain our primary concern.



   (K)   We believe that responsible business people and others living
in the village should not be discouraged from  running for office  by the
establishment of unrealistic or arbitrary regulations.

acting in good faith to carry out the person's official duties, to exercise
the person's clearly defined rights or to report or otherwise bring to the

Such departments shall make a list of costs available to the public. Any
department head may submit to the Village Treasurer an itemized statement of
expenses for providing services for which the recovery of costs is to be

§ 42.07  APPEALS TO VILLAGE MANAGER.



   (A)   Any responsible party who receives a statement of costs
assessed pursuant to this chapter may appeal any or all of the amount shown
on the statement by filing a written appeal with the Village Manager within
14 calendar days of the date of the statement of costs. The appeal must be
accompanied by a written explanation as to all of the reasons why the full
amount on the statement should not be charged to the person and why the
responsible party believes the costs assessed pursuant to this chapter should
be modified. Any reason, basis or argument for a modification of the assessed
costs not set forth in the written appeal shall be deemed waived by the
responsible party. Failure to file a written appeal within 14 days of the
date of the statement of assessed costs shall constitute a waiver of the
responsible party's right to appeal and to appear before the Village Manager.

the appeal and schedule a hearing with the responsible party to discuss the

the request that the village modify the assessed costs. The responsible party
shall be limited, in addressing the Village Manager, to those reasons and
bases set forth in the responsible party's written appeal and have the burden
of proving, by a preponderance of relevant facts, that the determination
appealed from is erroneous in whole or in part. The Village Treasurer and the
department head from the department from which the costs originated shall
have the opportunity to participate in the hearing and to address the Village
Manager to explain the process by which the assessed costs were determined
and allocated. The Village Manager, after hearing the responsible party and

determination appealed from. If the Village Manager determines that the
person is not liable for any or all of the expense of the response or that
the payment of the costs will impose an undue hardship, the Village Manager
may waive any or all of the costs. The decision of the Village Manager shall
be final when made. The Village Treasurer shall then send a statement of
assessed costs to the responsible party, by first class mail, to the last
known address of the responsible party. The assessed costs shall be due and
payable 30 days from the date of that statement. If the responsible party

   (E)   If a statement of costs is not paid in full or appealed within
30 days of the date of the statement, or paid in full within 30 days of the
denial or partial denial of an appeal, the village, to the extent allowed by
applicable law, may pursue any responsible party under one or more of the
subsections below.



      (1)   The Village Manager may authorize the Village Attorney
to commence a civil action to recover the costs, plus a late payment penalty
of 1% per month or part of month during which the costs remain unpaid,
together with attorneys' fees and any other costs allowed by law.



      (2)   The Village Treasurer may place the charges for
collection with a collection agency designated by the village.



      (3)   In cases where services have been rendered to real or
personal property in the village, or the owner of real or personal property
in the village, the charges shall constitute a lien on the property. The
Village Treasurer shall file or cause to be filed a notice of lien within two
years after such charges are incurred, which notice of lien shall be recorded
with the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds.

judgment, fine, penalty, restitution, damages, interest, tax, reimbursement,
recovery of a cost incurred by the village or other source of indebtedness to

CHAPTER 44:  ELIGIBILITY PROCEDURE UNDER THE PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
ACT



Section



   44.01   Purpose



   44.02   Application form, medical information and affidavit



   44.03   Health insurance benefits pending a final determination



   44.04   Applicant election of alternate group insurance



§ 44.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method
of determining the eligibility of an employee for the benefits enumerated
under the Public Safety Employee Benefits Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 320, §§ 1
et seq.) (PSEBA), as amended.  All benefits provided public safety employees
shall be consistent with PSEBA, which provides basic group health insurance
for an injured employee, the injured employee's spouse, and for each
dependent child of the injured employee until the child reaches the age of 25
if the child continues to be dependent for support or the child is a
full-time or part-time student and is dependent for support.  In accordance
with PSEBA, the benefits ascribed herein are limited to group health
insurance and do not include any additional benefits the PSEBA applicant may
have received as an employee of the village, including, but not limited to
dental or vision insurance.  The village has identified its BlueAdvantage
HMO Plan as its basic group health plan.  The Village Manager retains the
right to identify an alternative basic group health plan as needed.



(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)



§ 44.02  APPLICATION FORM, MEDICAL INFORMATION AND AFFIDAVIT.



   (A)   In conjunction with a request for PSEBA benefits, a public
safety employee, or his/her representative, shall file a completed, notarized
application for PSEBA benefits, waiver for relevant medical information, a
general waiver for relevant information and an affidavit for PSEBA coverage
with the Village Manager within 60 days of a Pension Board Duty Disability
determination. The application for PSEBA benefits shall include, but shall
not be limited to, a fully detailed statement of the nature of the employee's
claim giving full particulars thereof, i.e. date, time, place, nature of
injury, and any other factual circumstances surrounding the incident giving
rise to said claim. A copy of all required forms is attached hereto and
incorporated herein. The Village Manager is hereby authorized to modify
aforementioned forms as needed in accordance with Illinois law.



   (B)   Within 21 days after receipt of the aforesaid PSEBA
application, the Village Manager shall determine whether sufficient
documentation has been presented to warrant approval of the requested PSEBA
benefit. Should the Village Manager approve the PSEBA benefit, the Village
Manager shall issue a written decision which shall be deemed a final
administrative decision under the Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735,
Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.), as amended. Should the Village Manager deny the
request for PSEBA benefit, the Village Manager shall issue a written decision
to that effect. A copy of the Village Manager's written decision shall be
promptly served on the PSEBA applicant by certified mail.



   (C)   Should the Village Manager determine additional information
regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to the
injury are needed, he or she is hereby authorized to request additional
information from the PSEBA applicant within 21 days of receipt of an
application. In doing so, the Village Manager shall make a request for
additional information in writing, allowing a reasonable amount of time for
the applicant to respond to such requests and designating such deadline in
the request. Should the Village Manager request additional information, he or
she will make a determination regarding benefits within 15 days of receipt of
the PSEBA applicant's supplemental documentation.



(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)



§ 44.03  HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION.



   Until a final unappealable determination of PSEBA eligibility has been
made, a public safety employee shall be entitled to maintain his/her prior
health insurance as a village employee. However, until a final, unappealable
determination of PSEBA eligibility has been made, a public safety employee,
or his/her representative, shall be responsible for the prompt payment of all
health insurance premiums as though the public safety employee was not
eligible for PSEBA benefits. Should the public safety employee be found to be
eligible for PSEBA benefits by virtue of a final, unappealable judicial
determination, the public safety employee, or his/her representative, shall
be promptly reimbursed by the village for any out-of-pocket health insurance
premiums paid from the date of the employee's catastrophic, PSEBA-related
injury death or the date of the Pension Board awarded line-of-duty disability
pension.



(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)



§ 44.04  APPLICANT ELECTION OF ALTERNATE GROUP INSURANCE.



   A PSEBA beneficiary retains the right to elect any group health plan
available to village employees. An election which incurs a premium cost above
the cost associated with the basic group health plan will require a
beneficiary, his or her spouse and/or dependents to remit the difference in
premium costs above the identified basic group plan to the village. The
Village Manager will inform the PSEBA beneficiary of the time and manner in
which he or she must remit premium payment in accordance with the village's
contractual agreements with its insurance providers.

request shall state the reasons why water service should not be discontinued.
Hearing will be held within 72 hours after receipt of the request for a

further be the duty of the owner or occupant of the premises and the
individual water user to notify the village of any tampering, removing,
injuring, or destruction of any water meters immediately upon their acquiring
knowledge of any tampering.

Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.076  EXTENSIONS; SERVICE OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.



   (A)     Before any extension to the existing water main supply
system is installed other than extensions constructed by the village itself,
detailed plans and specifications of the proposed work shall be submitted to
the Director of Public Works and the Village Engineer for their approval. 
When approved, the work shall be carried on strictly in accordance with the
submitted plans and specifications under the general supervision of the
Director. No change in the plans will be permitted without the express
written approval in advance by the Director.  Anyone installing any such
extension shall give prior written approval to the provisions of division (B)
below.



   (B)     All extensions to the village water main supply system
hereafter made shall become the property of the village immediately upon
installation without regard to who may have paid for the cost of installation.



   (C)     Anyone who may hereafter construct water supply mains
outside the village limits which become a part of the water distribution
system of the village, shall maintain at their expense the mains so
constructed to keep them in good operating condition for a period of five
years after installation.  To guarantee this maintenance, a person shall
furnish a surety bond or other security acceptable to the village, approved
by the village, in the amount specified by the village, but not less than
$5,000, and conditioned upon the village  being reimbursed for or the person
paying all expenses incurred in maintenance of these mains.  After the
five-year period has expired, the village will assume full maintenance of the
mains, and the bond or other  security  will  be cancelled.  Failure to
keep a bond or other security in full force for the period required shall be
sufficient cause to shut off the water, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing as provided in § 50.021, and to keep the water shut off until the
bond or other security is reinstated.



   (D)     Whenever any water mains are constructed under this
section, the contractor shall, prior to final approval and payment, provide
as-built drawings of the water main and all appurtenances with sufficient
detail to satisfy the Director of Public Works.  This shall be accompanied
by the certificate of the designing engineer, certifying the correctness of
the as-built drawings.



   (E)     Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as giving any
person, firm, or corporation a vested right to water service or to the
continuance of water service to any property outside the village limits. The
President and Board of Trustees reserve the right to deny, consistent with
law, any application for an extension of the village water supply mains or
for the furnishing of water to any property outside of the village from
existing mains if it deems such denial in the interest of the public welfare,
or if such extension of water service creates an unreasonable demand upon the
water system.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.077  PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.



   Private agreements to contribute to the cost of a water main
installation by a subsequent customer are permissible, but the village shall
assume no responsibility for the enforcement of any agreements.  No property
located outside the village limits will be allowed to connect to a water
supply main unless otherwise agreed to by the President and Board of
Trustees.  The foregoing rules shall not apply to contracts or agreements
previously entered into by the village which may be in conflict therewith,
except as those agreements may hereafter be modified.  Nor shall any rules
or other provisions of this chapter be construed to imply a grant or right to
anyone outside the village limits to connect to the village's water system.



CONSTRUCTION AND CONNECTIONS



§ 50.090  CONNECTION PERMIT REQUIRED.



   All  applications to connect service pipes  with the village supply
mains, for the installation  of water meters, or for any other use of the 
village water supply as may now or hereafter  be authorized, shall be filed
with the Director of Public Works,  who  shall issue all permits therefor
upon forms provided for that purpose. However,  no  permit shall be issued
by the Director until all fees for same, as provided in this chapter, shall
have been paid to the village and a receipt issued.  No permit will be
issued to any plumber who has not fully complied with all regulations of the
village concerning plumbing.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.091  WATER SERVICE LINES.



   (A)     Materials and sizes.



      (1)     All water service lines connected to the village
supply mains up to and including two inches internal diameter shall be of
cold drawn, soft annealed seamless copper tubing known by the trade name of
Type K.  All water services larger than two inches internal diameter shall
be constructed of ductile iron cement lined pipe of a quality and weight
equivalent to Class 52 as specified by the American Water Works Association.



      (2)     The minimum size for any service line shall be
three-quarters of one inch (3/4") internal diameter, except that for premises
where the potential use would, in the opinion of the Director of Public
Works, require a larger service line to maintain adequate pressure, the
Director may require a larger size service line than the three-quarters of
one inch (3/4").



      (3)     All service taps larger than one inch shall be
supported by a service saddle.  For services larger than two inches, special
cast iron tees shall be used to make the connection to the village supply
main after approval of the proposed method for connection by the Director of
Public Works.



   (B)     Methods of installation.



      (1)     Taps in the village supply main shall be made on the
side of the main low enough to keep the service pipe below the top of the
main.  No tap shall be made closer than 18 inches to any bell or hub.



      (2)     Service pipe shall be in one continuous piece and
shall be laid in a straight line from the main to the curb box as near as
possible at right angles to the line of the street and shall have at least
4-1/2 feet of earth cover at all points. Any service pipes installed in, or
disturbing any public or private sidewalk, driveway, or street shall require
granular trench backfill (no sand shall be allowed).



      (3)     The curb stop and buffalo box shall  be  installed
in the parkway at a point  18  inches  from  the outer edge of the 
sidewalk  if  a  sidewalk  is  in  place.  If  there is no sidewalk
they shall be installed 7-1/2 feet from the lot line. They shall not be
installed in the area of a driveway or sidewalk.  In commercial areas where
there are no parkways buffalo boxes may be located at such points as may be
approved by the Director of Public Works.



      (4)     All connections and joints on a service line shall
remain uncovered until an inspection has been made with water pressure on to
determine if there are any leaks and that the line meets with other
requirements of the village.  Any leaks shall be repaired immediately before
the line is covered.  Particular care shall be taken to see that the buffalo
box is properly placed and vertical.



   (C)     Service lines to more than one building.  A separate and
complete service line shall hereafter be installed for each distinct property
or premises.  In no event will a single service line be hereafter allowed to
serve two properties under separate ownership.  Accessory buildings on a
single property may be served from the service line to the main building, but
separate meters for the accessory buildings may be installed either at the
request of the person receiving water service or on order of the Director of
Public Works.



   (D)     Records of service lines.  It shall be the responsibility
of the Director of Public Works to maintain permanent records of the service
lines installed showing location, sizes, number of taps, and other pertinent
information.



Penalty, see § 50.999

   Maintenance of service lines, see § 50.112



§ 50.092  WATER METER VALVES.



   It is required that either a long-rising stem full sized gate valve or
a full port ball valve be installed directly before and directly after all
water meters.  Brass valves will be used on all copper services.  Cast iron
valves will be used on all cast iron services.



(Am. Ord. 93-0-072, passed 10-26-93)  Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.093  USE OF WATER DURING CONSTRUCTION; FEES.



   Whenever a building permit is issued, the minimum water service charge
shall be paid, in addition to the building permit fee, to the village for
each three-month period while the building is under construction and before
the permanent water meter is installed and protected from freezing to cover
the cost of unmetered water used during the construction period and
anticipated use in the building prior to installation of the permanent meter.
If, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, the use of water during
the construction period may be excessive, the Director may require the
installation at the owner's  expense of a temporary outside meter to measure
water used, which shall then be paid for at the regular metered water rates.



§ 50.094  TURNING ON WATER.



   No plumber or other person shall turn on the supply of water to any
building or premises prior to the installation of a meter on all service
lines installed, or shall allow the same to be done, without a permit from
the Director of Public Works. However, this section shall not be construed to
prevent plumbers from turning on water to test the piping and fixtures and to
provide water for construction purposes, in which case the plumber shall turn
off the water as soon as these needs are met.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.095  WATER MAINS: HORIZONTAL SEPARATION.



   (A)   A water main shall be laid at least ten feet horizontally from
any existing or proposed drain or sewer line. However, should local
conditions prevail which would prevent a lateral separation of ten feet, a
water main may be laid closer than ten feet to, or in the same trench as a
storm or sanitary sewer provided the main is laid in a separate trench or on
an undisturbed earth shelf located to one side of the sewer and at such an
elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least 18 inches above the
top of the sewer.



   (B)   If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and vertical
separation as stipulated in this section and § 50.096, both the water main
and sewer shall be constructed of mechanical-joint, ductile-iron pipe and
shall be pressure-tested to assure watertightness before backfilling.



(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)



§ 50.096  WATER MAINS: VERTICAL SEPARATION.



   (A)   Whenever water mains must cross house sewers, storm drains, or
sanitary sewers, the water main shall be laid at such an elevation that the
bottom of the water main is 18 inches above the top of the drain or sewer.
This vertical separation shall be maintained for that portion of the water
main located within ten feet, horizontally, of any sewer or drain crossed,
this ten feet to be measured as the normal distance from the water main to
the drain or sewer.



   (B)   However, where conditions exist such that the minimum vertical
separation set forth in division (A) cannot be maintained, or it is necessary
for the water main to pass under a sewer or drain, the water main shall be
laid with mechanical-joint, ductile-iron pipe; and the mechanical-joint pipe
shall extend on each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the
water main to the sewer or drain line is at least ten feet. Where a water
main must cross under a sewer, a vertical separation of 18 inches between the
bottom of the sewer and the top of the water main shall be maintained, along
with means to support the larger-sized sewer lines to prevent their settling
and breaking the water main.



(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)



§ 50.097  WATER SERVICE LINES.



   The horizontal and vertical separation between water service lines and
all sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or any drain shall be the same as for
water mains, as detailed in §§ 50.095 and 50.096 above. However, when
minimum horizontal and vertical separation cannot be maintained, brass, or
copper, in addition to mechanical-joint, ductile-iron pipe, may be used for
water service lines.



(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)



REPAIRS; MAINTENANCE



§ 50.110  PERMIT REQUIRED FOR REPAIRS.



   No water service line or connection shall be repaired or altered
without first securing a permit from the Director of Public Works.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.111  REPAIRS REQUIRING STREET OPENING.



   (A)     Before opening any street for the construction or repair of
any supply main or service line, a permit must first be obtained from the
Director of Public Works.  This permit requirement shall be waived for any
work done by contract with the village or by authorized village employees.



   (B)     Any street opening made for installation or repair of
village supply lines or service lines shall be repaired in accordance with
the applicable provisions of all village ordinances.  All user service lines
shall be augered if crossing pavements maintained by the village.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.112  MAINTENANCE OF SERVICE LINES.



   It shall be the responsibility of the customer to maintain the entire
length of the customer's service line from its connection with the curb stop.



Penalty, see § 50.999



§ 50.113  MAINTENANCE OF PIPES AND FIXTURES.



   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a building or premises
to maintain all water piping and fixtures on the owner's property in good
repair and free from leakage of water.  In case of leakage or faulty
plumbing resulting in unnecessary waste of water, the owner shall make
necessary repairs promptly on notice from the Director of Public Works.  On
failure to do so within the time specified, the water supply will be
discontinued until such repairs are made and approved, after notice and an
opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as provided for in § 50.021.



Penalty, see § 50.999



ADMINISTRATION



§ 50.125  DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS.



   The system of water mains and pipes, pumping station, wells,
reservoirs, grounds, buildings, and appurtenances shall be under the
administrative control of the Director of Public Works.  When any action
herein is to be taken by the Director, this action may also be taken by the
Director's duly authorized agent or agents.



§ 50.126  INSPECTIONS.



   The Director of Public Works and his agents or representatives shall
have free access during all reasonable hours, in accordance with law, to all
parts of any building or premises on or in which village water is delivered

there is any unnecessary waste.  If access is refused, the supply of water
may be shut off after notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided in
§ 50.021.



§ 50.998  DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR VIOLATIONS.



   (A)     Whenever two or more properties are already supplied by one
existing service line, the failure on the part of any party owning, residing
on, or otherwise occupying any of the properties to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, or if the single service line becomes
unserviceable, shall be sufficient authorization for the Director of Public
Works to discontinue the service, after notice and an opportunity for a
hearing as provided in § 50.021, and without any liability whatsoever to any
one or all parties.



   (B)     The President and Board of Trustees reserve the right to

§ 51.061  CONTROL MANHOLE.



   (A)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole
and, when required by the village or MWRD, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole together with those necessary meters and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of
the wastes.  A manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
village and MWRD.  The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at
all times.



   (B)   (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements,
tests, and analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this
chapter and any special conditions for discharge established by the village
or MSDGC.



      (2)   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village and MWRD,
but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis
of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance
with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall
report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village and
MWRD at those times and in a manner as prescribed by the village.  The owner
shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required
by the village or MWRD.  At those times as deemed necessary, the village or
MWRD reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service.



   (C)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at the control manhole.  In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.)

IRED; EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)     No sewerage system permit of the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago will be approved by the village
unless the permit shall provide for the retention of stormwater in the area
covered by the permit in a central basin as provided for herein.



   (B)   The President and Board of Trustees of the village recognize
that in certain circumstances it may not be feasible for an applicant for a
sewer permit to retain its stormwater in a central basin.  In those
circumstances an exception may be granted by the President and Board of
Trustees after recommendation to it by the Village Engineer, to an applicant
for a Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago sewerage
system permit, when any one or more of the following circumstances warrants
an exception:



      (1)     Where the uniqueness of the land as it relates to
topographical, geological, and geographical considerations warrant an
exception.



      (2)     Where the nature of the development, whether it be
single-family, multi-family, commercial, or industrial, and recognized
engineering standards, would warrant an exception.



      (3)     Where the timeliness of the development as it relates
to other development in the area and the overall status of the central basin
program warrants an exception.



      (4)     In the event an exception shall be granted by the
village for any one or more of the foregoing reasons, then the applicant
shall provide for the retention of stormwater runoff as heretofore
established for wet central basin.



   (C)     The President and Board of Trustees may grant an exception
in favor of dry retention, only after recommendation by the Village Engineer
and only when one or more of the following factors are present:



      (1)     The natural rate of flow-through from upstream would
not support a wet pond.



      (2)     When the ecological balance of the pond, such as the
quality of the water to maintain plant and fish life, is that the quality of
water could not reasonably be maintained.



      (3)     When the nature of the recreational needs of the area
dictates a dry pond.



      (4)     When the aesthetic considerations as they pertain to
the surrounding development dictate a dry pond.

§ 51.076  MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CENTRAL RETENTION FACILITIES.



   The central retention facilities shall meet the following minimum
criteria:



   (A)     A combination of storage and controlled release of
stormwater runoff is required for all nonresidential developments exceeding
five acres in area, for all residential developments exceeding ten acres in
area and for all residential developments between five and ten acres which
have an impervious area of 60% or greater.  However, a residential
development of ten acres or less must have an adequate outlet as signified on
the permit by the Village Engineer.  If the outlet is not adequate, then
detention, as determined by the Village Engineer, will be required to store
that portion of the runoff exceeding the outlet capacity.



   (B)     (1)     The release rate of storm-water from all
developments requiring detention shall not exceed the storm- water runoff
rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state.  Because of the flat
conditions of the land in this area, channel configurations cut by nature are
generally unable to handle the runoff from high intensity rainfalls and
results in flood plain storage or spreading of runoff over the land areas
during the larger storm periods.  In order not to increase the runoff from
those areas after development, the release rate must be limited to the
carrying capacity of these natural channels.  The village will accept the
release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of three-year
frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of 0.15, unless the applicant can
show by his detail calculations, which are acceptable by the village, that
the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater.



      (2)     Channels, road crossings, and other conveyance
systems that connect new developments with central retention facilities that
require improvement must be incorporated into the overall design.
Calculations and drawings showing the proposed improvements are to be
submitted for approval of the Village Engineer.



   (C)     Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass
through the development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of
design frequency of ten years assuming that the land is in a fully developed
state under present zoning or zoning proposed under the Comprehensive Plan. 
The bypass flow rate shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not
less than 0.35.  An allowance will be made for upstream detention when such
upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the
village and that evidence of its construction can be shown.



   (D)     The live detention storage to be provided will be
calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published by
the U.S. Weather Bureau for this area.  The detention volume required will
be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any and
all durations, from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the
reservoir, less that volume discharged during the same duration at the
approved release rate.



   (E)     Construction, filling or other similar physical occupation
of the flood plain, may be permitted if adequate compensatory storage volume
is provided.

sewerage system permit is approved by the village, the applicant therefore,
shall submit to the village calculations and detailed drawings of the
stormwater retention facilities. The drawings must include topography, size,
capacity, slope of banks, soil borings, type of landscaping, inlets, outlet
control, and other pertinent data.  In the event the Village Engineer
determines that there is unsuitable soil in pond areas, and so recommends to
the Village Board, then the Village Board shall require the applicant to
remove the undesirable soil as a condition of the applicant's development and
relocate the same as shall be approved by the Village Board on the advice of
the Village Engineer.

§ 51.084  INSTALLATION OF WATER WELLS FOR MAINTAINING ADEQUATE LEVELS IN
RETENTION PONDS AND FOR IRRIGATING FIELDS.



   (A)   For the purpose of maintaining adequate water levels in storm
water retention ponds utilized as the water source for landscape irrigation
systems, the installation of irrigation wells will be allowed pursuant to the
criteria outline in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(4) and divisions (C) through
(H).



      (1)   Only areas in excess of three acres shall be allowed to
install irrigation wells for the purpose of recharging retention ponds used
as a supply for landscape irrigation.



      (2)   The storm water retention pond must be wholly owned and
maintained by the person, business or entity wishing to install the
irrigation well.



      (3)   In cases where the pond is owned and maintained by a
Homeowners Association or other non-public entity, a special service area
will be established by the village, at the expense of the Homeowners
Association or other non-public entity, for the maintenance, repair,
replacement or abandonment of said well and associated equipment.  The
special service area will remain inactive pending necessity for the village
to maintain, repair, replace and/or abandon the well and equipment due to
failure of the Homeowners Association or other non-public entity to maintain
same in accordance with village, state and/or federal regulations.



      (4)   Irrigation wells for the purpose of recharging retention
ponds shall be designed to have a maximum pump capacity of 20 gallons per
minute.  Wells in excess of this standard will be reviewed on a case by case
basis and must be approved by the Village Board.



   (B)   For the purpose of irrigating public and quasi-public athletic
fields, and similar areas with at least 40,000 square feet of open fields or
green space, the installation of irrigation wells will be allowed pursuant to
the criteria outlined in divisions (B) through (H).



      (1)   Only athletic fields owned and operated by public and
quasi-public entities, or similar areas with at least 40,000 square feet of
open fields or greenspace, will be allowed to install wells for the purpose
of irrigating the fields.



      (2)   Water from the irrigation wells can only be used for
irrigation purposes.  In no circumstance may water from the wells be used
for human consumption, food preparation, cleaning and the like.



      (3)   Wells for the purpose of irrigating fields shall be
designed to have a maximum pump capacity of 20 gallons per minute.  Wells in
excess of this standard will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and must be
approved by the Village Board.

USER CHARGES



§ 51.094 QUARTERLY CHARGES; WASTEWATER COLLECTION SERVICES.



   Wastewater Collection Service Charges are for the operation and
maintenance of the Village sanitary sewer system for the collection of
wastewater (sanitary sewerage) from a customer service location, and the
transportation of such wastewater to the point of delivery to the facilities
maintained by the governmental agency or business responsible for performing
the water reclamation and disposal of the residual solid waste (also referred
to as sewerage treatment) services. The wastewater collection charges may
also be referred to as the "sewer collection" or "sewer" charge.



   (A)   Measurement of flow. The basic wastewater collection charge
shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters. The volume of flow
used for computing basic user charges shall be the same as determined for the
purposes of metered water consumption.



      (1)   If a person, business, or other entity who is
discharging wastes into the village public sanitary sewers procures any part,
or all, of their water from sources other than the village's water system,
all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the party shall
install and maintain, at their expense, water meters of a type approved by
the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
the other sources.



      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater
discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from metered water consumption.



         (a)   Such metering devices for determining the volume
of wastewater shall be in accordance with Village specifications for this
purpose. Such devices shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the party
receiving wastewater collection services. Following approval and
installation, the meters may not be removed, without the consent of the
village unless service is cancelled.



         (b)   If an accurate determination of wastewater
generated and entering the village's wastewater collection system facilities
can be made by the village's Public Works Department, or the owner or
occupant of the property, by means of actual sewerage flow monitoring and or
metering, then the wastewater collection charge shall be based on the number
of gallons of wastewater produced for the billing period in 1,000 gallon
increments.



      (3)   If the user can prove through metering devices approved
by the village, and installed at the user's expense, that a portion of the
water used is not entering the wastewater collection system, such usage shall
be excluded from the wastewater collection service charges.



      (4)   Non metered users. All non-metered users of the
wastewater collection system facilities (a sanitary sewer connection only,
without a corresponding water service connection) shall have a measurement of
wastewater flow imputed for purposes of computing the wastewater collection
service charge if measurement of wastewater flow is not otherwise determined
by measurement as identified in division (A)(2) of this subsection.



         (a)   Imputed residential per person usage.



            1.   In the case of a residential dwelling unit,
the quarterly amount of wastewater generated per person shall be imputed to
be 8,000 gallons (based on United States Geological Survey statistics
regarding the typical gallons of domestic consumption of water per person,
per day). This imputed usage rate shall be multiplied times the number of
occupants of the dwelling unit for the quarterly billing period.



            2.   The resident or owner of the dwelling unit
shall be required to provide an accurate number of occupants of the home for
such billing purposes at least on an annual basis.



            3.   If the number of occupants cannot be
reasonably determined, a minimum residential per person charge shall be
computed using three occupants (based on United States Census Bureau
statistics of local population in relation to units of housing).



         (b)   Imputed non-residential per person usage;



            1.   If an accurate determination of wastewater
generated and entering the village's wastewater collection system facilities
can not be determined by measurement, then the additional charge shall be
calculated by means of the actual, or average (in the case where occupancy
fluctuates from day to day) number of occupants of said property for the
billing period, following the per person formula provided under division
(A)(4)(a)1. of this section.



            2.   For non-residential properties where
non-metered use of the wastewater collection system facilities (sanitary
sewer connection only, without corresponding water service connection) is
provided, and neither wastewater produced can be determined as provided under
division (A)(2) of this section, or the number of actual or average occupants
as provided under division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section can reasonably be
determined, the additional charge shall be based on ten residential per
person charges as provided under division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section.



      (5)   The amount of the wastewater collection system charges
provided under this section shall be presented separately on the quarterly
utility bill from any other charges contained therein.



   (B)   For wastewater collection services provided through December
31, 2009.  The wastewater collection service charge for the use of and for
service supplied by the wastewater collection system of the village shall
consist of a user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, and
a debt service charge.



      (1)   Wastewater collection service rate.  The basic user
rate for wastewater collection services shall be applied to all users of the
wastewater collection system of the village and shall be billed on a
quarterly basis as follows:



 

Rate per 1,000 gallons
 
Effective date


$0.77
 
May 1, 2004 through December 31, 2009



 



      (2)   Debt service charge.



         (a)   The debt service charge shall be computed by
dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding loans, bonds, and the
like, by the number of users. Through further divisions, the quarterly debt
service charges can be computed.



         (b)   A debt service charge of $1.26 per quarter to each
user of the wastewater collection system of the village is established.



      (3)   Minimum charge. A minimum charge for wastewater
collection services shall be computed at the basic user rate in effect for
the billing date times a minimum of 6,000 gallons of water consumption per
quarter. (Wastewater collection rate per 1,000 gallons times six). Said
minimum charge shall be charged to each user of the wastewater collection
system in addition to the debt service charge provided under division
(B)(1)(b) of this section.



      (4)   Each dwelling unit shall be counted as a separate user
for purposes of computing a minimum wastewater collection system charge for
an apartment house or other multi-unit dwelling under a common central water
meter.

§ 51.096  SEWER TREATMENT CHARGES.



   (A)   All property located in Frankfort Township, Will County and
also within the corporate limits of the village is subject to a wastewater or
sewer treatment charge (also known as water reclamation) for treatment and
disposal of sewerage wastes.



   (B)   The computed sewer treatment charges are in addition to the
charges set forth in §§ 51.094 and 51.095.



   (C)  The amount of the wastewater treatment charges provided under
this section shall be presented separately on the quarterly utility bill from
any other charges contained therein.



   (D)   Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Chicago Service
Area.



      (1)   For that portion of the village which lies within
Frankfort Township, Will County and also within the wastewater service area
under an agreement between the village and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago (hereinafter "MWRD"), an amount shall be charged
for wastewater treatment services and computed as follows:



         (a)   The most currently available equalized assessed
valuation for the property at the time the quarterly bill is being prepared
shall be multiplied by the most recent available real estate tax rate of the
MWRD for property within its district boundaries (primarily in Cook County)
and the result thereof shall be multiplied by 140% to obtain the annual
wastewater treatment charge for such property.



         (b)   One quarter of this amount shall be added to each
subsequent quarterly utility bill rendered.



         (c)   Each year, as a new equalized assessed valuation
becomes available for the subject property and/or a new tax rate becomes
available for the MWRD, the amount of such user charge shall be recomputed
utilizing such new equalized assessed valuation and/or tax rate and shall
apply to the subsequent quarterly utility bills rendered.



      (2)   This sewer treatment charge is applicable to all
properties which lie within the corporate limits of the village in Frankfort
Township, Will County and also within the designated wastewater service area
under an agreement between the village and the MWRD regardless of whether the
property is vacant land or otherwise developed.



      (3)   From time to time, a property owner may have had cause
to appeal the valuation of property for property tax purposes, or have an
error corrected that affects the property valuation, which may have resulted
in the recalculation of the related annual property tax bill. Should a
property valuation (equalized assessed valuation) for a given tax year be
reduced, the Village utility customer may be eligible for a reduction in the
related sewer treatment charge which is based on the equalized assessed
valuation.



         (a)   The recalculation of an annual sewer treatment
charge under this section due to a subsequent adjustment to equalized
assessed valuation will not occur automatically as the village is not
notified of such changes as they occur. It is the property owner's
responsibility to notify the village of such changes in order to initiate the
recalculation of the annual sewer treatment charges.



         (b)   The property owner must provide the Village
Treasurer, or such other person that may be designated by the Treasurer, with
valid and legible documentation of the revised or adjusted equalized assessed
valuation. Upon verification and validation of the information provided, the
calculation of the annual sewer treatment charges based on that tax year's
equalized assessed valuation can be recalculated and adjusted.



         (c)   Any such adjustment to the sewer treatment charge
will be provided as a credit against the current and future sewer treatment
charges.



   (E)   Village of Frankfort Service Area. For that portion of the
Village which lies within Frankfort Township, Will County and also within the
wastewater service area under an agreement between the village and the
Village of Frankfort (hereinafter "Frankfort"), an amount shall be charged
for wastewater treatment services and computed as follows:  The amount of
quarterly water consumption billed under § 50.023 times the Village of
Frankfort Basic User Charge rate per 1,000 gallons in effect on the date the
bill is being rendered.



   (F)   Illinois-American Water Company Service Area. For that portion
of the Village which lies within Frankfort Township, Will County and also
within the wastewater service area under an agreement between the Village and
the Illinois- American Water Company (formerly known as Citizens Utilities
Company of Illinois, hereinafter "IAW"), an amount shall be charged for
wastewater treatment services and computed as follows:



      (1)   The difference between the IAW "Collection and Treatment
Service"and "Collection Service" rates in effect during the billing period
shall be used to compute the wastewater treatment charges.



      (2)   As it is acknowledged that the terms "Collection and
Treatment Service" and "Collection Service" may change from time to time in
relation to the IAW tariff schedules, these terms shall also cover such other
terminology that may be used to distinguish between the charges applicable to
sewer collection and sewer treatment such that the charges applicable to
sewer treatment alone can be separately determined.



      (3)   Such charges may include both a fixed and volumetric
(consumption) based charges based on the Illinois Commerce Commission
approved tariff schedules that may be in effect during the billing period.
The current IAW rate structure is based on monthly billing. The computation
of the applicable wastewater treatment charges herein shall be adjusted to
reflect the Village quarterly billing cycle.

shall have a penalty charge of 10% added thereto. However, if the final day
for such payment falls on either a Sunday or a legal holiday when the village
is not open for business, such day shall be excluded from the computation of
the 20-day period allowed for payment without a penalty charge.

necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, the Director of
Public Works shall give notice to the customer to install such approved
backflow prevention device at each service connection to the premises. The
customer shall immediately install such approved device or devices at his or
her own expense; failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to
install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have
been installed. The customer shall retain records of installation,
maintenance, testing and repair as required for a period of at least five
years. The Director of Public Works shall require the customer to submit a
cross-connection inspection report to the Village of Tinley Park to assist in
determining whether or not service line protection will be required. All
cross-connection inspections shall be conducted by a Cross-Connection Control
Device Inspector certified by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

      (1)     Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.



      (2)     Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown
alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other
movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of- way to pedestrians lawfully
within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.

      (1)     Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or
yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is
being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter.



      (2)     Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-307, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and
no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.



   (C)     Steady red indication.



      (1)     Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this
section, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is
no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain
standing until an indication to proceed is shown.



      (2)     Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this
section, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter
the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless
entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal,
shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line,
before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if
there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall
remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such
red arrow is shown.



      (3)     Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and
local authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation
prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may
cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a
one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division
(C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the
right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another
roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such
driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways. 
Such driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.



      (4)     Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-307, pedestrians facing a
steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.



   (D)     In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected
and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application.  Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the
absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.



   (E)     The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals
as applicable to vehicles.

SPEED RESTRICTIONS



§ 72.001  SPEED LIMITS.



   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this village at a
speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property.  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed
the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty
to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when
approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when
traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists
with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or
highway conditions.  Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid
colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance
with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.



   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which
is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
division (C) below, by § 72.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under
this chapter.



   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit in an urban district for all vehicles is:



      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and



      (2)   Fifteen miles per hour in an alley.

            3.   A public, private, or religious nursery
school.



      (2)   On a school day when school children are present and so
close thereto that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity
of the motorized traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in
excess of 20 miles per hour while passing a school zone, or while traveling
on a roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.



      (3)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate
signs are posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located.  With
regard to the special speed limit while passing schools, the signs shall give
proper due warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate
the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when
school children are present.



      (4)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of
electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special
school speed zone or a construction or maintenance zone indicating the zone,
as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be
inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding, provided the use of the device
shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in the special school
speed zone or a construction or maintenance zone.



      (5)   A first violation of this section is a petty offense
with a minimum fine of $150.  A second or subsequent violation of this
section is a petty offense with a minimum fine of $300.



      (6)   (a)   When a fine for a violation of this section is
$150 or greater, the person who violates the section shall be charged an
additional $50 to be paid to the unit school district where the violation
occurred for school safety purposes.  If the violation occurred in a dual
school district, $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to the elementary school
district for school safety purposes and $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to
the high school district for school safety purposes.  Notwithstanding any

§ 72.067  RAILROAD GRADE CROSSINGS.



   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad
grade crossing, that person must exercise due care and caution, as the
existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and
under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop
within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the
railroad, and shall not proceed until he can do so safely.  The foregoing
requirements shall apply when:



      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device
gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train;



      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or
continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train;



      (3)   A railroad train approaching a highway crossing emits a
warning signal and the train, by reason of its speed or nearness to the
crossing, is an immediate hazard;



      (4)   An approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is
in hazardous proximity to the crossing;



      (5)   A railroad train is approaching so closely that an
immediate hazard is created.



   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under
any crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier
is closed or is being opened or closed.



   (C)   The village, with the approval of the Department of
Transportation, are authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway
grade crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When stop signs
are erected, the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less
than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only
upon exercising due care.



   (D)   At any railroad grade crossings provided with railroad
crossbuck signs, without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices,
crossing gates, or a human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage
of a train, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable
for the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a
clearly marked stopped line, or if not stop line, within 50 feet but not less
than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed
until he or she can do so safely. 



      (1)   If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train after driving past the
railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima facie
evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.



      (2)   No person may drive any vehicle through a railroad
crossing if there is insufficient space to drive completely through the
crossing without stopping.



   (E)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.

decal or device is not the authorized holder of the disability license plate
or parking decal or device or is not transporting the authorized holder of
the disability license plate or parking decal or device to or from the
parking location, and the person uses the disability license plate or parking
decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through the disability
license plate or parking decals or devices under this code.



      (3)   It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section
that either the sign posted pursuant to this section of the intended
accessible parking place does not comply with the technical requirements of
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-301, Illinois Department of Transportation
regulations, or regulations of the village, of a reasonable person would be
made aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking place that the place

some material of equal resiliency.  Solid tires shall be considered
defective, and shall not be permitted to be used, if the rubber or other
material has been worn or otherwise reduced to a thickness of less than
three-fourths of an inch, or if the tires have been so worn or otherwise
damaged as to cause undue vibration when the vehicle is in motion, or to

§ 80.01  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient
method of enforcement of the village's regulations through administrative
adjudication of charges of non-vehicular violations of this Code. All
provisions of this Code may be enforced through the administrative
adjudication system, provided the system shall have no authority to impose a
penalty of incarceration or adjudicate an offense under the Illinois Motor
Vehicle Code, which is a traffic regulation governing moving vehicles, or to
impose a fine in excess of $50,000. The village reserves its right to employ
all other means and methods available under the law to enforce this Code,
including direct application to the courts.



   (B)   PA 90-0516 to be found at Section 1-2.1-2 of the Illinois
Municipal Code, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 1-2.1-2, allows home rule
municipalities to provide by ordinance for a system of administrative
adjudication of municipal code violations to the extent permitted by the
Illinois Constitution. The village is a home rule municipality. The Illinois
Constitution provides that a home rule unit may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs (Illinois
Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(a)(1970)). The Illinois Constitution also
provides that a home rule unit may exercise and perform concurrently with the
state any power or function of a home rule unit to the extent that the
General Assembly by law does not specifically limit the concurrent exercise
or specifically declare the state's exercise to be exclusive (Illinois
Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(i)(1970)). The Illinois Constitution further
provides that the powers and functions of home rule units shall be construed
liberally (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(m)(1970)).



(Ord. 2004-O-009, passed 1-27-04)

owing the village under this section. The lien may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment lien would be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Act 5 § 6-306.5(c).



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.04  VIOLATION NOTICE.



   A violation notice shall be served by mail to the address of the
registered owner of a vehicle cited for an automated traffic law violation as
recorded with the Secretary within 30 days after the Secretary notifies the
village of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later
than 90 days after the violation. The violation notice shall include the name
and address of the registered owner of the vehicle, the registration number
of the motor vehicle involved in the automated traffic law violation, the
violation charged, the location where the violation occurred, the date and
time of the violation, a copy of the recorded images, the applicable penalty,
a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a red light
signal, a warning that failure to pay the applicable penalty or contest
liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a
suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle,
a statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the penalty or by
challenging the charge by mail or by administrative hearing, and the website
address where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.
Service of a violation notice shall be deemed complete as of the date of
deposit in the United States mail. The original or a facsimile of a violation
notice or, in the case of a violation notice produced by a computerized
device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on
the violation notice, shall be retained by the Administrator, and shall be a
record kept in the ordinary course of business. A violation notice issued,
signed and served in accordance with this chapter and ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 §
11-208.3, a copy of the violation notice or the computer generated record
shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the
correctness of the facts shown on the violation notice. The violation notice,
copy or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent
administrative or legal proceedings.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.05  DETERMINATION OF VIOLATION BY TECHNICIAN.



   Before a citation may be issued for any automated traffic law
violation, a determination must be made by a technician employed or
contracted by the village that, based on inspection of recorded images
generated by the system, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of
§ 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-306), or
similar provision of this village code, as described in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5
§ 11-208.6. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the
intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the
right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. Nor
shall a citation issue where a motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and
does not enter the intersection, as defined by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 1-132,
during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one or more pedestrians
or bicyclists are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a
stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop. All determinations
by a technician that an automated traffic law violation occurred must be
reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement
officer of the village prior to a citation being issued.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.06  ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.



   The registered owner of the vehicle cited in a violation notice shall
have the opportunity for an administrative hearing in which said owner may
contest the merits of the alleged violation. The lessee of a vehicle cited in
a violation notice likewise shall be afforded the opportunity for a hearing
of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The formal or technical rules
of evidence shall not apply at any such hearing. Such hearings shall be
recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the
Administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by
subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at such a hearing may be
represented by counsel at their own expense. No additional fee shall be
charged to an alleged violator for exercising his or her right to a hearing.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.07  DEFENSES.



   A hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:



   (A)   That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor
vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control
of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation. In order
to establish such defense, the owner must submit proof that a report
concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a
law enforcement agency in a timely manner; or



   (B)   That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection
when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an
emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.08  FINAL DETERMINATION OF LIABILITY.



   A final determination of automated traffic law violation liability
shall occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty after a hearing
officer’s determination of violation liability. Where a person fails to
appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner
specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer’s determination of
violation liability shall become final: (a) upon denial of a timely petition
to set aside that determination, or (b) upon expiration of the period for
filing such a petition without a filing having been made.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.09  DETERMINATION NOTICE.



   A determination notice shall be sent following a final determination of
automated traffic law violation liability and the exhaustion of, or failure
to exhaust, any proceedings in a petition to set aside a finding of liability
or of any judicial review procedures taken under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 §
11-208.3. A determination notice shall be sent by first class United States
mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited
vehicle as recorded with the Secretary or, if any notice to that address is
returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United
States Post Office approved database or, under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 §
11-1306, to the lessee of the cited



vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the
time of the lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as
undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post
Office database. Service of the determination notice shall be deemed complete
as of the date of deposit in the United States mail.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.10  PETITION TO SET ASIDE FINAL DETERMINATION.



   A person owing an unpaid fine or penalty for automated traffic law
violation penalty may file a petition to set aside a final determination of
such liability within ten  days after such determination is made. Such a
petition shall be filed by sending the same, together with any documentation
in support thereof, to the Administrator by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal delivery to the Administrator. The grounds for such
a petition shall be limited to: (a) the person not having been the owner or
lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (b)
the person having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in
question, (c) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a
hearing. A hearing on such a petition shall be held within 30 days after the
filing of same. In the event that such a petition is granted upon a showing
of just cause, and the subject determination of automated traffic law
violation liability is thereby set aside, the registered owner shall be
provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.11  SUSPENSION NOTICE.



   A suspension notice shall be sent to the person liable for any fine or
penalty that remains due and owing on five or more unpaid automated traffic
law violations. The suspension notice shall be sent by first class United
States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary or,
if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known
address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. Service of
a suspension notice shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the
United States mail.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.12  CERTIFIED REPORT.



   If the Administrator provides a suspension notice to a vehicle owner
and subsequently makes a certified report to the Secretary, the subject
vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in writing.
To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the Administrator a written
statement under oath, together with any supporting documentation,
establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the
certified report: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the
subject vehicle or vehicles receiving five or more automated traffic law
violations on the date or dates such violation notices were issued, or (2)
that the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five or more
automated traffic law violations indicated on the certified report. Such
statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the Administrator by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-delivered to the
Administrator within five days after the person receives notice from the
Secretary that the person’s driver’s license will be suspended at the end
of a specified period of time unless the Secretary is presented with a notice
from the village certifying that the fines or penalties due and owing have
been paid or that the inclusion of the person’s name on the certified
report was in error.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.13  CHALLENGE BY NON-RESIDENTS.



   Non-residents of the village who receive violation notices may contest
the merits of the alleged automated traffic law violation without attending a
hearing by sending a signed statement, under oath, together with any
supporting documentation, to the Administrator via certified mail, return
receipt requested, within ten days after



service of the violation notice. Such a statement shall set forth the reasons
why a finding of liability should not be entered. The Administrator shall
rule on such a statement within ten days after receipt of same, and shall
inform the non-resident of his or her decision within ten days thereafter.



(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)



§ 81.99  PENALTY.



   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle cited for an automated traffic
law violation received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer at
the time of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a
penalty of $100 per violation. In the event that such penalty has not been
paid by the time a determination notice is issued (no earlier than 35 days
following a final determination of liability), the penalty shall increase to
$125. In no case shall an additional fee be charged to an alleged violator
for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing.

   (B)   When an abandoned vehicle of more than seven years of age is
impounded as specified by this subchapter, it will be kept in custody for a
minimum of ten days for the purpose of determining the identity of the
registered owner and lienholder by the U.S. Mail, public service, or in

to be towed, inquiry shall be made of the Secretary of State of the
particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered
name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as
provided herein to the address furnished. In no case will the village be
required to delay towing more than seven days after the date of the mailing
of the notice if no request for a hearing has been received within that
seven-day period.



      (3)     A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest
date upon which the tow may take place and the address and phone number of

      (1)     The owner or person entitled to possession of a
vehicle, to be towed as an abandoned vehicle, shall have seven days after the
date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a
pre-tow hearing.  Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be
towed.  If the owner has not filed a written request for a hearing within
the seven-day period, the hearing provisions of this subchapter will be
deemed waived.



      (2)     Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be made in
writing or in person to the office indicated on the notice, with hearings to
be scheduled at some time prior to towing.  Forms for the requests shall be
made available at the Police Department.  The pre-tow hearing shall be

      (4)     The hearing shall be informal in nature and the rules
of evidence shall not apply.  After receiving all relevant evidence, the
Hearing Officer shall make a written decision as to whether towing of the
vehicle is authorized by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the
village.  The owner shall be provided a copy of the pre-tow hearing
decision.  In the event that the evidence supports towing and compliance
with the provisions of this subchapter, the Hearing Officer shall authorize
that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and storage costs to then be
imposed upon the owner thereof.  The owner of the vehicle having had such a
hearing may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the
improper location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful
condition of the vehicle.



      (5)     In the event that a pre-tow notice is not received by
the owner of the vehicle, post-tow hearing procedures are available, upon
request of the owner as provided in § 90.22.



      (6)     Where the evidence fails to support towing or
immobilization of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed.  The village shall furnish a copy of the
decision to the owner.  No vehicle about which the decision has been
rendered shall be towed by the village unless the circumstances under which
the decision was rendered have changed.  If at some  subsequent time the
village should wish to tow the vehicle from the same location, it shall
follow the same procedures required for the towing of any other similarly
situated vehicle.

         (h)   All areas used for the feeding and grazing shall
be maintained to prevent soil erosion and run off to neighboring properties.



      (5)   Screening of the premises.



         (a)   Licensed premises must contain a 6' solid fence to
screen the area which contains the chicken coop and open chicken run from
adjacent properties. Consideration will be given for a vegetative screen
instead of a fence if the setback distance between the chicken coop and
residential structures not occupied by the licensee is greater than 100'.



         (b)   Use of a chicken tractor will require the entire
area within which the tractor is moved to meet this screening requirement.

   (C)   Notice and hearing.  Prior to revoking any alarm user permit
issued pursuant to this chapter, the Alarm Director shall provide the alarm
user with written notice, via certified mail or personal delivery, setting

personal delivery of the Alarm Director's notice of the revocation. In the
report, the alarm user may describe actions that have been taken or will be

or that will be taken will substantially reduce the likelihood of false
alarms, if such revocation is based on the occurrence of eleven or more false
alarms; or, whether the alarm user has effected compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, if the revocation is based on any grounds for
revocation other than excessive false alarms. Within 14 days of the Alarm
Director's receipt of the alarm user's written report, the Alarm Director

written revocation notice. The Chief of Police shall serve written notice of
the time and place of the informal hearing on the alarm user, by certified
mail or personal delivery, within 14 days of the alarm user's request for the
informal hearing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Chief of Police

alarm user's request for the hearing.



      (2)   At the informal hearing, the alarm user may offer
evidence of his compliance with the provisions of this chapter and/or, in the
case of revocation based on excessive false alarms, evidence of actions that
the alarm user has taken or will take to identity and eliminate the cause or
causes of the false alarms. In the case of revocation based on eleven or more
false alarms in a calendar year, the Chief of Police shall determine whether
the alarm user's remedial efforts (or proposed efforts) will substantially
reduce the likelihood of false alarms and the Chief of Police shall issue to
the alarm user, via certified mail or personal delivery, written findings
regarding such determination and a written order regarding the revocation of
the alarm user's permit. In the case of revocation based on grounds other
than excessive false alarms, the Chief of Police shall determine whether the
alarm user has effected compliance with the provisions of this chapter and
shall issue to the alarm user, via certified mail or personal delivery,
written findings regarding such determination and a written order regarding
the revocation of the alarm user's permit. In either case, the Chief of
Police shall render a final decision regarding the revocation within 14 days
of the hearing.

ABATEMENT PROCEDURES



§ 98.35  DUTIES OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS.



   The Director of Public Works shall diligently inquire concerning the
introduction and existences of weeds, tall grass or other nuisances in the
village and if any are found growing or existing therein, he shall take
charge of all such growing or nuisance conditions and take care that they do
not go to seed or otherwise spread, and he shall carefully seek and learn, so
far as practicable and in his judgment, the best methods of their
destruction, cutting or abatement and he shall persistently apply in proper
time, such remedy or treatment as shall be best calculated to prevent their
spread and to eradicate the same.



(Ord. 2008-O-017, passed 6-17-08)



§ 98.36  DUTY OF OWNER TO DESTROY OR CUT; NOTICE.



   It shall be the duty of all owners of lands on which weeds are found
growing, to destroy the same before they reach a seed bearing state and to
prevent such weeds from perpetuating themselves. It shall be the duty of all
owners of property abutting any public streets, roads or ways to maintain the
area between the edge of the pavement or curb and their property line,
commonly known as the parkway, in a neat, clean and orderly condition and
free of any weeds and tall grass. It shall be the duty of all owners of land
on which any other nuisance exists to abate such conditions, which shall
include the cutting of tall grass. The Director of Public Works shall notify
the owner, agent, or occupant of any lands, or the owners of any property
abutting any public street, road or way, on which weeds are found growing,
tall grass, or other nuisance exists, in writing of such fact. Failure of the
Director of Public Works to give such notice shall not, however, constitute a
defense of any action to enforce the payment of any costs imposed for
abatement or other fee or penalty provided for or debt created under the
provisions of this chapter. Nuisance trees that are dead or declining due to
disease or insect infestation as determined by the Illinois Department of
Agriculture or the village shall be cut at ground level, with all firewood
and woody debris disposed of in accordance with the Illinois Department of
Agriculture regulations.  In case any such owner, agent, or occupant shall
refuse or neglect to destroy such weeds, cut tall grass, or abate the
nuisance, it shall be the duty of the Director of Public Works to enter upon
such lands and to destroy the weeds or cause the same to be destroyed, cut
tall grass, or abate the nuisance. Express power to enter upon such lands and
destroy such weeds, cut tall grass, or abate any other nuisance is hereby
conferred upon the Director of Public Works. Any owner who  maintains a
nuisance either on the owner's property or on the public parkway abutting the
owner's property, as provided for in this section, shall, in addition to
notice and abatement under this section and § 98.37, be subject to a
violation of § 98.21 and to any resulting graduated fines as provided in §
98.99.

   (A)   In addition to the penalties provided in § 98.99 for

to direct that the weeds, tall grass or other nuisance on the lot or piece or
parcel of land, including without limitation the parkway, be cut or otherwise
abated either by an employee of the village or by some private person at
reasonable cost.  The cost, which shall be reimbursed by the owner
immediately, shall consist of the actual cost of weed, tall grass or other
nuisance removal plus the administrative costs of the village related to the
matter, including inspections, research regarding ownership and preparation
and mailing of notices. If such reimbursement is not made, the cost shall be
a lien upon the real estate affected, superior to all subsequent liens and
encumbrances, except tax liens, provided that after the cost and expense are
incurred the corporate authorities of the village, or the person performing
the service by authority of the Director of Public Works, in his or its own
name, shall file notice of lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of
Cook or Will Counties, Illinois, or in the office of the Registrar of Titles
of Cook County if the land is registered under the Torrens System, whichever
is applicable. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out the
following:



      (1)   A description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof;



      (2)   The amount of money representing the cost and related
administrative and other expense incurred or payable for the service; and



      (3)   The date or dates which set cost or expenses thereof
became delinquent.



   (B)   After notice of a lien has been filed with the Recorder of
Deeds and upon payment of the cost and expenses, including the cost of
recording the notice and release (if such release is to be recorded by the
village) by the owner of or persons interested in the lot or piece or parcel
of land, a release of the lien by the village or person in whose name the
lien has been filed shall be delivered to the person so paying the cost and
expenses or shall be recorded by the village.

punished by a fine of not more than $750. 



   (C)   Each day a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter
shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.  Imposition of any
penalty for a violation of this chapter shall not be construed as a waiver of
the right of the village to collect the costs of removal of any nuisance or
nuisances as provided by the provisions of this chapter and/or to file such
costs as a lien against the property on which the nuisance exists.

the owner of or persons interested in the property after notice of lien has
been filed, a release of the lien by the village or person in whose name the
lien has been filed shall be delivered to the person so paying the cost and

exceed the cost of the restorations.  The interest in any such account shall
accrue to the benefit of the tenant.  A landlord may condition permission

the processing or by denying or varying the terms of a loan or other

discriminate in the fixing of that amount, interest rate, duration or other
terms or conditions of such loan or other financial assistance.



   (C)   Other financial services.  Discriminate against any person by

§ 103.01  PURPOSE; SCOPE.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies
and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the
village’s jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with
the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the
village rights-of-way and the village as a whole.



   (B)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to
all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the
public rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue
to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any
applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.



   (C)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in
its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such
an agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent
with this chapter.



   (D)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.



      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In
the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any
conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the
village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such
franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the
term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



   (E)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all
chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of such conflict.



   (F)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that
applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or
state laws or regulations.



   (G)   Sound engineering judgment. The Village shall use sound
engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the
standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the
Village so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability
of the Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare.

§ 103.06  EFFECT OF PERMIT.



   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest
created. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only
certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public
rights-of-way.



   (B)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by
the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances,
rules, and regulations.

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate
from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit
also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with § 103.21 of this chapter. If the
village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting solely and exclusively from the negligence, misconduct or breach of
this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.



(Ord. 2007-O-050, passed 8-21-07)



§ 103.10  SECURITY.



   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall
be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the
permittee’s sole cost and expense until the completion of the work
authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:



      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this chapter;



      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and



      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village
must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee’s failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the
village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable
law.



   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the
village in the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in
a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the village and the permittee;



      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and



      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and
within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Director of
Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that
the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to
perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under
the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village,
with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not
be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Village Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of
sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security
which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit.
The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
division (C) for any single phase.



   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for
such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:



      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or



      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that
the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.



   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice
from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
division (C) of this section.



   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by
the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the
minimum balance required in division (C) of this section.



   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a
result of the revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with
respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the
village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of any right with respect to the security
fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery
with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise
violated.

technically possible to install any such facilities underground, such
facilities shall be substantially screened from view by landscaping pursuant
to a landscaping plan which shall be approved in advance by the Village
Manager, or his or her designee.



      (3)   All freestanding facilities within any right-of-way
shall be so located so as to cause only the minimum possible interference
with the use of such right-of-way and so as to cause only the minimum
possible impact upon, and interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-way. No freestanding
facilities shall be placed within any right-of-way in such a manner to
interfere with the usual travel on such right-of-way, nor shall such
facilities limit the visibility of vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic within
such right-of-way.



      (4)   The owner of any freestanding facility shall promptly
comply with the reasonable requests of the Village Manager, or his or her
designee, with respect to the location and screening of such facilities
within any right-of-way.

as determined by the Village Manager, or his or her designee; and



      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location,
and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest
protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without
adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to,
self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration
of conductors and shall, in any event, include screening by landscaping
pursuant to a landscape plan which shall be approved in advance by the
Village Manager, or his or her designee.



      (4)   Where above-ground facilities are permitted in any
right-of-way, such facilities shall be so located so as to cause only the
minimum possible interference with the use of such right-of-way and so as to
cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the rights
and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-way.
When permitted, no above-ground facilities shall be placed in any
right-of-way in such a manner to interfere with the usual travel on such
right-of-way, nor shall such facilities limit the visibility of vehicular
and/or pedestrian traffic within such right-of-way.



      (5)   The owner of any facilities shall promptly comply with
the reasonable requests of the Village Manager, or his or her designee, with
respect to the location and, if above ground, the screening of such
facilities within any right-of-way.



      (6)   Where above-ground facilities are permitted in any

      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or
roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other
means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall
include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles,
cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from
the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are
volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.



      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a
facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data
demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:



         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the
commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to
persons and property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;



         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance
of the highway structure in the transportation system;

Works shall decide on an individual basis whether a variance is authorized
for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request.



   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Director of
Public Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:



      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.

   (A)   The Village Clerk or, at the request of the Village Clerk, the
Village Manager, may at any time suspend or revoke a permit if the operation
or conduct of the event is in violation of any conditions, rules, and/or
regulations imposed on the permit, any applicable provisions of this Code or
any other applicable law, or if, in the judgment of the Village Clerk, such
revocation is necessary to preserve the health or safety of the public. When
circumstances permit, the permittee, the event manager, and/or the sponsoring
organization shall be given such notice as is possible and an opportunity to
be heard prior to such suspension or revocation. In addition, the Village
Clerk, or Village Manager at the request of the Village Clerk, is authorized
to suspend or revoke a permit if he or she finds:



      (1)   That the application for the permit is incomplete and/or
contains any false, fraudulent or misleading material statement;



      (2)   That the applicant, permittee, event manager, and/or the
sponsor have made any false, fraudulent or misleading material statement, or
have been convicted of perpetrating a fraud upon any person, whether or not
such fraud was perpetrated in the course of conducting any business in the
village; or



      (3)   That the applicant, permittee, event manager, and/or the
sponsor have conducted any activities in the village in an unlawful manner or
in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the peace or a menace to the
health, safety or general welfare of the public.



   (B)   Automatic suspension of the permit shall occur whenever the
insurance required under this chapter, or as otherwise required for operation
of said event, has lapsed or is canceled.



   (C)   Except when suspension of a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter is automatic as provided in this chapter, the Village Clerk, or
designee, shall provide written notice of the suspension and/or revocation of
such permit stating the reasons therefor, which notice shall be transmitted
to the applicant, the permittee, the event manager, and the sponsor, if any,
via electronic mail, at the electronic mail addresses provided on the
application for such permit, or personally served upon the permittee or upon
the event manager, or designee, at the time of revocation. Unless the permit
will expire by its own terms before a hearing can be reasonably scheduled, no
revocation will take effect until the sponsor and/or permitee have been given
notice and an opportunity to be heard. When necessary to prevent an immediate
threat to the health or safety of the public, the Village Clerk, the Village
Manager or the Chief of Police, or their designee, shall be and is hereby
authorized to order the permittee to immediately cancel and require all
activities of the event to cease.

person to park or leave unattended any vehicle in violation thereof.

poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.



   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a
permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the
permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole
or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the

provider that  self-insures is not required, to the extent of the
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional
insureds under this chapter. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

§ 110.01  PURPOSE; JURISDICTION.



   (A)     Because each commercial establishment located in the
village or doing business in the village is a basic part of and affects the
physical and economic well-being of the village necessitating special
services from the village in the form of fire, health, sanitation, building,
and police inspections and services, these commercial establishments shall in
all respects be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
This chapter is designed to provide for the means whereby the village may
render the necessary inspections and services to commercial establishments
and commercial areas in order to promote, protect, and safeguard the public
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village and to enable the
effecting of an accurate record of commercial establishments located and
carrying on commercial establishments activities or commerce within the
village.



   (B)     The commercial establishments so registered may or may not
have their principal place of business located within the village.



   (C)     Persons subject to license. Whenever a license is required
for the maintenance, operation, or conduct of any business or establishment,
or for doing business or engaging in any activity or occupation, any person,
firm, or corporation shall be subject to the requirement if by himself or
through an agent, employee, or partner, he holds himself forth as being
engaged in the business or occupation; or solicits patronage therefore,
actively or passively; or attempts to perform any part of a business or
occupation in the village.



   (D)   The business license fees provided for herein are not intended
to license any business or profession that is not subject to the village's
licensing authority nor are they to be construed as an endorsement of the
competency or skill of any individual, company, corporation or other entity.

§ 110.02  APPLICATION.



   (A)     Applications for all licenses and permits required by
ordinance shall be made in writing to the Village Clerk in the absence of
provision to the contrary.  Each application shall state the name of the
applicant (and in the case of a partnership, the name and addresses of all
partners and in the case of a corporation, its president, secretary, and
registered agent), the license desired, the location to be used, if any, the

   (B)     It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly give false
information or falsely affirm or swear to any matter in the application for a
license or obtain a license by fraudulent means, or to display a fictitious
or fraudulently altered license or permit, or otherwise to misuse any
license.  The corporate authorities shall, pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, suspend or revoke the license of any person, firm, or
corporation who violates the provisions of this section and any suspension or
revocation shall be in addition to any and all other penalties hereinafter
provided.

§ 110.03  INVESTIGATION OF APPLICATION.



   Upon the receipt of an application for a license or permit where any

application to the proper officer for making such investigation within 48
hours of the time of the receipt.  The Village Clerk will circulate the
application to all other village departments to determine if the applicant
owes any fees, fines or penalties to the village.  If any such fees, fines,
or penalties are owed, the applicant shall be notified of the fees, fines, or
penalties and they shall be paid or otherwise adjusted to the satisfaction of
the village before any license or permit is issued.  In addition, the
Village Clerk shall forward the license application to the Zoning
Administrator to determine if the use or proposed use of the property
complies with the village's zoning ordinance.  In the event of a change of
occupancy of business, all necessary inspections coordinated by the Building
Commissioner or other designated officers shall be made and certificate of
occupancy be issued before a business license shall be issued. The officer
charged with the duty of making an investigation or inspection shall make a
report thereon, favorable or otherwise, within ten days after receiving the
application or a copy thereof.  The Health and Consumer Protection Officer
shall make or cause to be made an investigation in regard to those licenses
in connection with the care and handling of food and the prevention of
nuisances and the spread of disease, for the protection of health.  The
Building Commissioner shall make or cause to be made any inspections relative
to the construction of buildings or other structures.  All other
investigations except where otherwise provided shall be made by the Chief of
Police or some other officer designated by the Village President.  All
licenses shall be presented to the Chair of the Licensing Committee prior to
issuance.

establishment so as to occasion any nuisance, or so to be dangerous to life
or detrimental to health.

FEES



§ 110.25  CERTAIN FEES BASED ON SQUARE FOOT AREA; FEE SCHEDULE.



   (A)     Business license fees based upon square foot area are
predicated upon the premise that there is a finite amount of square footage
in all of the commercial zoning districts within the village.  These
commercial districts require substantial services over and above the services
provided for single-family homes and other residential districts.  The
business activities conducted within the village require these extra services
regardless of the activity being conducted within each commercial space. 
Therefore, the fee is based equitably upon the square foot area of each place
of business as a minimum fee. Minimum fee schedule shall be based on square
feet of floor/land area.  "Floor/land area" being the sum total of the gross
horizontal areas of all of the several floors of a building and its accessory
buildings measured in square feet from the exterior faces of the exterior
walls or from the center line of party walls separating two buildings or
business establishments on each floor, cellar floor, motor vehicle parking
space when the floor space is used in conjunction with a drive-in commercial
establishment (excluding however all common area parking provided for any
four or more stores or offices in any shopping or business area) and
commercial establishment, devoted to the sale, service, or repair of motor
vehicles (including the sale of gasoline and related petroleum products),
floor space used for mechanical equipment, whether open or enclosed,
penthouse attic space, balconies, mezzanines, porches and verandas, floor
area devoted to and occupied by accessory used.  Special enumerated fees
shall be a substitution for a fee based on square footage unless otherwise
slated.

§ 110.26  WHEN FEES TO BE PAID; REBATES AND REFUNDS.



       In the absence of provision to the contrary all fees and charges
for licenses of permits shall be paid in advance at the time of application
therefor.  Except otherwise provided all license fees shall become a part of
the corporate fund.  In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any
business regulation certificate of permit fee, or part thereof, by reason of

§ 110.27  EXEMPTIONS.



       The foregoing licensing and registration requirements are not
applicable to any business which is specifically and expressly preempted from
local regulation and control by state or federal law.  However, when a
business which is preempted from local control is operated as a portion of a
commercial establishment which also engages in business activities which are
not so preempted, the registration fee shall apply to the entire commercial
establishment, and the registration fee shall be computed based on that
portion of the floor/land area of the commercial establishment which is not
devoted to the preempted business.



(Ord. 84-0-050, passed 11-27-84)



§ 110.28  TERM OF LICENSE; PRORATION OF FEES.



   (A)   All annual licenses other than contractor licenses shall
terminate on December 31 in each year where no provision to the contrary is
made; except as otherwise expressly provided, the applicant for a license
other than a contractor license for a new place of business or to engage in a
new occupation shall be required to pay the full annual license fee specified
where the fee is $40 or more per annum, if at the time of the application for
a license three months or more but less than six months have expired he or
she shall be required to pay three- fourths of the annual license fee; if six
months or more but less than nine months have expired the applicant shall be
required to pay one-half of the annual license fee; if nine months or more
shall have expired, the applicant shall be required to pay one-fourth of the
annual license fee.  No license shall be issued for less than one-fourth of
the annual fee.



   (B)   If the annual license fee shall be less than $40, the license
fee shall be prorated semi-annually.



   (C)   The Village Clerk shall mail to all licensees of the village,
other than contractor licensees, a statement at the time of the expiration of
the license held by the licensee.  However, if the license is an annual
license, then the notice of expiration shall be mailed three weeks prior to
the date of expiration.  A failure to send out the notice, or the failing of
the licensee to receive it shall not excuse the licensee from a failure to
secure a new license, or a renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in any
action for operation without a license.



   (D)   The term of a contractor license shall be one year from the
date of issuance.

§ 110.29  PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO RENEW BY JANUARY 31.



   Any licensee who fails to pay the fees and charges for the renewal of a
license or permit by January 31 of the year following termination of the
license shall be charged a penalty of $50.  The penalty shall be paid at the
time of renewal of the license.  However, this section shall not be
applicable to contractors.



(Ord. 95-0-023, passed 5-22-95)



§ 110.30  TEMPORARY BUSINESS LICENSE.



   Provided that there is no danger to the public health and safety, and
further provided that a temporary or permanent occupancy permit has been
issued to a particular business for a particular location within the village,
a temporary business license may also be issued in accordance with procedures
established herein and any applicable administrative regulations of the
village. A temporary or permanent occupancy permit does not permit the
operation of any business required to have a business license under the
provisions of this chapter. A person seeking a temporary business license
must apply in writing to the Assistant Village Manager setting forth with
specificity the reasons why a temporary business license should be issued,
and the hardship or other conditions which justify such issuance. No
temporary business license shall be issued hereunder for a period in excess
of 45 days. It is the intent of this provision that a temporary business
license may, under appropriate circumstances, be issued, but that temporary
licenses will only be issued where the deficiencies in the application are
minor in nature and can be rectified within a set timetable. The Assistant
Village Manager shall be empowered to establish necessary conditions to make
certain that before the expiration of the temporary business license the
applicant shall be in a position to fully comply with the provisions of this
chapter and all other applicable ordinances, rules and regulations of the
village. The Assistant Village Manager in granting a temporary business
license shall specifically indicate in writing the length of time for which
such license is applicable. It shall be the responsibility of the recipient
of the temporary business license to rectify all deficiencies prior to the
expiration of said temporary business license, and the failure to do so may
constitute sufficient grounds to deny issuance of a permanent business
license.  Any temporary business license shall be presented to the Chair of
the Licensing Committee prior to issuance.

   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this
chapter shall be fined not to exceed $500 for each offense or jail sentence
as deemed appropriate, but not greater than six months.  A separate offense
shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs
or continues.

§ 112.17  APPROVAL, DENIAL OF APPLICATION.



   (A)   All applications for license under this chapter shall be
delivered by the Village Clerk to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner.  It
shall be the duty of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to investigate and
consider the application. For this purpose the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner may enlist the aid of the Chief of Police and any other village
officials or employees that he or she deems necessary to complete the
investigation. The investigation shall include a background search and credit
check. At any time during the pendency of an application the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner shall have the right to compel the applicant to submit
to any examination and to produce any books and records which, in the
judgment of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, are material to the
determination of whether the applicant is qualified to receive a license
under the provisions of this code, or whether the premises sought to be
licensed are suitable for such purposes. The Local Liquor Control
Commissioner shall also have the right to require the applicant to answer any
charges made in any objection to the issuance of the license made by the
Chief of Police, a prosecuting official, or by the sheriff or prosecuting
attorney of the county relative to the same. The failure of any applicant to
appear at the time and place fixed by the Local Liquor Control Commissioner
for his or her examination or to produce books and records when requested,
unless for good cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission that the
applicant is not qualified to receive a license and, therefore, a basis for
denial of the license.



   (B)   Upon completion of the investigation, the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the issuance of a license based on
the application, provided, in the case of approval, that there exists an
available license as set forth in § 112.22.

$250. No application shall be processed until such application fee is paid.



   (B)   All license fees provided in § 112.20 shall be paid in
advance in equal semi- annual installments on or before the first day of

in full unless the Local Liquor Control Commissioner determines that there
are sufficient reasons existing to allow the licensed premises to remain open
for a stated period of time.

sooner revoked as provided in this chapter.  Such license shall not
constitute property; be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution; be
alienable or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily; nor shall it be
subject to being encumbered or hypothecated.



      (1)   Such license shall not descend by the laws of testate or

      (2)   However, the executor or administrator of the estate of
any deceased licensee or the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee,
when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor, may continue the

bankruptcy until the expiration of the license but no longer than six months

applicable health requirements, contains no building or fire/safety
violations or other violations of any applicable laws and ordinances, and
otherwise meets with the approval of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner in
the lawful exercise of his or her powers and duties. Further, the renewal
privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested right which
shall in any case prevent the Board of Trustees from decreasing or increasing
the number of licenses to be issued within the village.



      (1)   Application for renewal of a license shall be filed with
the Village Clerk on or before November 15 preceding the expiration

and repairs), or any partnership or corporation or limited liability company
shall be dissolved, the license shall terminate forthwith.  However, other
than in the case of the termination of a partnership or the dissolution of a
corporation or limited liability company, a licensee may continue the license
in full force and effect, provided the Local Liquor Control Commissioner is
notified by the licensee within 40 days from the date of the sale of the
business or its discontinuance of a desire to maintain the license, the

original license. In the case of a church, the distance of 100 feet shall be

or consumption of alcoholic liquors.



   (D)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit a church or church
affiliated school from locating within 100 feet of a property for which there

the granting of an initial special use zoning permit for the church or church
affiliated school, provide that the 100-foot restriction in this section
shall not apply to that church or church affiliated school and future retail
liquor licenses.

apply for a Certificate of Condominium Conversion by submitting a completed
application form to the Building Commissioner.



   (B)   No Certificate of Condominium Conversion shall be issued
unless the completed application form is accompanied by the payment of the
inspection fee as defined in § 116.55.



   (C)   The Village Building Commissioner shall inspect, or cause to
be inspected, the multi-family rental dwelling structure where condominium
conversion is intended to occur to determine whether the multi-family rental
dwelling structure is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  No
Certificate of Condominium Conversion shall be issued until the Building
Commissioner, and/or his/her designee inspects the property and finds such
property to be in compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances.  Each
applicant shall be notified by the Building Commissioner in advance of the
date and time of such inspection.  Within ten days after receipt of
notification of the inspection date and time, the owner shall notify each
tenant of the date and time of the inspection and submit proof of such
notice, along with any objections by tenants, to the Building Commissioner. 
If any tenant refuses to consent to an inspection of a dwelling unit, the
Building Commissioner may either begin proceedings to obtain an
administrative search warrant for the particular dwelling unit or waive the
inspection requirement for the Dwelling Unit occupied by a tenant who refuses
consent.  The Building Commissioner shall inspect or cause to be inspected
the subject property for compliance with the Building, Housing, Property
Maintenance, and Zoning Codes, and the ordinances of the village.  If
compliance is found, a Certificate of Condominium Conversion shall be issued
by the Building Commissioner within 14 days after inspection of the subject
property.  The Certificate shall constitute approval to initiate, within one
year from its date, conversion of the building to condominiums.



   (D)   If, after inspection, the Building Commissioner determines the
multi-family rental dwelling structure does not comply with all applicable
codes and ordinances, a list of deficiencies shall be prepared and furnished
to the applicant.  A second inspection shall be scheduled at a time after
the deficiencies have been corrected.  Upon reinspection and verification of
correction of the deficiencies, the Building Commissioner shall issue a
Certificate of Condominium Conversion.



   (E)   The Certificate of Condominium Conversion is not renewable for
additional periods.

the owner shall provide notice of the conveyance to the village.  Such
notice shall include the name and address of the person or persons succeeding

§ 116.56  SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATES.



   (A)   Whenever, upon inspection of a multi-family rental dwelling
structure based on consent, or upon inspection pursuant to an administrative
search warrant as defined in § 116.58 below, the Building Commissioner,
and/or his/her designee, finds that conditions or practices exist which are
in violation of the provisions of this chapter, any applicable provisions of
the codes and ordinances of the village, or any applicable rules or
regulations pursuant thereto, the Building Commissioner, and/or his/her
designee shall serve the owner with notice of such violation or violations. 
Such notice shall state that unless the violations cited are corrected within
a reasonable period of time, but not less than five days, except that in
emergency situations the time period may be reduced, any and all certificates
issued pursuant to this chapter may be suspended.



   (B)   At the end of the time period allowed for correction of any
violation cited, the Building Commissioner, and/or his/her designee, shall
reinspect or cause the reinspection of the multi-family rental dwelling
structure and, if it is determined that such violative conditions have not
been corrected, an order may be issued suspending any and all certificates
issued under this chapter.  The order shall take effect seven business days
following service upon the owner unless, in the interim, the Owner requests,
in writing, a hearing.



   (C)   Any owner whose certificate issued pursuant to this chapter is
subject to suspension, pursuant to a suspension order, shall be entitled to a
hearing on the suspension action by filing a written request with the Village
Clerk, for a hearing before the Village Building Committee, within seven
business days following the receipt of the suspension order.  Upon receipt
of the request, the hearing shall be scheduled to be held before the Village
Building Committee at a date not more than seven business days after receipt
of the written request.  At the hearing, the Village Manager, or such person
as the Village Manager designates, shall present evidence in support of the
suspension, and the owner shall be permitted to rebut such evidence that is,
in the discretion of the Village Building Committee, relevant and material. 
Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the Village Building
Committee may either:



      (1)   Confirm the suspension;



      (2)   Allow additional compliance time for correcting the
violations cited; or



      (3)   Rescind the suspension.



The Village Building Committee's decision shall be final and binding.  The
suspension of any certificate issued pursuant to this chapter shall not
release or discharge the owner from paying any fees due, nor shall such owner
be released from prosecution for violations of this chapter.



   (D)   If no petition for a hearing before the Village Building
Committee on a suspension order is filed as provided above, then such order
shall remain in effect until the violations in question have been corrected,
as determined by the Building Commissioner, and/or his/her designee, upon
inspection of the multi-family rental dwelling structure.  If, after two
months from the effective date of the suspension, the violations in question
are not corrected sufficiently to bring the property into compliance with
this chapter, the Building Commissioner, and/or his/her designee will issue
an order revoking any and all certificates issued pursuant to this chapter,
and the owner shall be required to submit a new application to the village in
order to obtain any new certificates as required by this chapter.  The
effective date and appeals process for a revocation order shall be the same
as for a suspension order as defined in this chapter.

§ 116.57  USE OF EVIDENCE

multi-family rental dwelling structure or dwelling unit, no entry or
inspection shall be made without the procurement of an administrative search
warrant from the Circuit Court of Cook or Will Counties.  The Court may
consider any of the following factors along with such other matters as it
deems pertinent in its decision as to whether a warrant shall issue:



      (1)   Eyewitness accounts of violations;

sale or a salvage sale, the goods to be sold at the sale shall be clearly and
distinctly segregated, marked, or identified, and advertised, if at all, so
that, both on display and in advertising, the goods may be readily
distinguished from other stocks, and their identity readily ascertained. 
Any commingling of goods with other stocks of the licensee in a manner to
cause the goods to lose their separate identity, either on display or in
advertising, shall be unlawful, and shall void any license issued to conduct
a sale pursuant to this chapter, and the license shall cease to apply to the
sale.



   (B)     No person in contemplation of conducting any going out of

the license, or any person violating any of the other provisions of this
chapter, shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than $500.  Each false

   (A)   (1)   Cigarette smoking is dangerous to human health; and



      (2)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the
use of tobacco products causes cancer, heart disease and various other
medical disorders; and



      (3)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared
that nicotine addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and
is the most widespread example of drug dependence in this country; and



      (4)   The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse
concluded that the majority of the 320,000 Americans who die each year from
cigarette smoking became addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age
of legal consent; and



      (5)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that
cigarette smoking precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug
use; and



      (6)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of
tobacco products to persons under the age of 18 has proven ineffective in
preventing such persons from using tobacco products.



   (B)   The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in
furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the
village, particularly those residents under 18 years of age.

towing vehicles are called to the scene of an accident or to impound vehicles
on a rotation basis, distributing the calls on an equitable basis from the
towing list. Placement of a vehicle towing service on the towing list shall
not confer any right to be called in any particular order or for any specific

designee shall not call or cause to be called any towing vehicle not licensed
with the village unless all applicable towing vehicles are unavailable.

her designee to call a towing vehicle out of sequence where proximity to the
wreck and estimated response time make it more practical to do so.
Additionally, the Chief of Police or his or her designee may request a tow
from a service on the special heavy-duty vehicle towing list pursuant to §
122.06(A) if the vehicle towing service first called cannot provide
heavy-duty towing service, or cannot subcontract for such service within a
reasonable time.



   (C)   In the event that it is necessary to impound a towed vehicle
for an indefinite period of time, the Police Department shall do so by
completing the necessary form (a “hold order”) at the scene of the tow.

vehicle. A verbal hold order will not be sufficient.



   (D)   A marked police squad car shall remain on the scene of an
accident to protect the tow truck driver during debris cleanup on the roadway
or other hazardous location.

   (N)   The vehicle towing service shall be responsible for meeting
the tow needs of oversized vehicles such as semi-tractor trailers and
vehicles similar in size and weight, which require larger super-sized tow
trucks (“heavy-duty towing service”). The maximum response time provided
in division (L) of this section may be extended if necessary to provide a
super-sized tow truck. The vehicle towing service may subcontract for
heavy-duty towing service during its on-call period if it does not have a tow

weight as specified herein; provided, however, that in the case of a divided
load, by which is meant a load containing more than one order for the same or
different purchasers or consignees no penalty shall be imposed under this

net weight of each order or delivery is correctly shown on the weight
certificate and such correct net weight is delivered.

public weigh master shall be delivered by the driver or person in charge of

consignee of such load, or to his or their agent, at the time of the delivery
and before any of the commodity, produce, or other article or articles of
merchandise is removed from the vehicles, or such certificates shall be
delivered to the members of the Police Department or any officer or employee
designated by the Village President and Board of Trustees upon his or their
demand.  When delivery is made, in case no person is present to receive such
commodity, produce, or other article or articles of merchandise, and if the
purchaser or consignee or his or their agent cannot be located, then the
memorandum or certificate of weight hereinbefore provided for shall be posted
conspicuously at the place of delivery, before any of the commodity, produce,
or other article or articles of merchandise is removed from the vehicle.

weight of a load lot between the net weight as set forth in the public weigh
master's certificate and the net weight as ascertained by reweighing such
reweighing such load shall not be considered a violation of this chapter.

interruptions of electrical service.



   "EMERGENCY LOAD CONSERVATION PROCEDURES" means a planned course of
action developed by an electric utility company to be implemented in
emergency situations when the demand for electricity exceeds, or is at
significant risk of exceeding, the supply of electricity available to the
electric utility.

a controlled rotating interruption of electric service and notify the
appropriate electric utility company personnel, and

shall be made pursuant to a notification procedure approved by the Village
President after consultation with the Village Board.  The Village President
may waive the notice requirement to accommodate exigent circumstances.



   (B)   Subsequent to providing the notice as required above, an
electric utility company shall reasonably and separately advise the village
officials when it implements the each of steps of the emergency energy
plan.  Such steps shall include the following:



      (1)   A request for emergency help from neighboring utilities;

Village President, immediately upon the determination that there will be a
controlled rotating interruption of electric service pursuant to the
emergency energy plan.  The notification shall include the areas to be
interrupted; the sequence and estimated duration of the service outage for
each area; and the affected feeders and number of affected customers in each
area.  Whenever practical, the notification shall be made at least two hours
prior to the time of the outages, and in no case shall the notification be
made less than 30 minutes prior to the outages, if the company is aware that
controlled rotating interruptions may be required.



   (D)   Notification required by this section shall be in addition to
any notification requirements set forth in any applicable franchise agreement
or franchise ordinance, or as may be required by applicable federal or state
law or regulation.

§ 128.01  LICENSE; LOCATION.



   (A)   In addition to the general licensing requirements set forth in
Chapter 110 of Title XI of this code, each firearms dealer located in this
village shall be required to apply for and obtain a special firearms dealer's
license.  For purposes of this chapter, "FIREARMS DEALER" shall mean any
federally licensed firearms dealer, excluding any person licensed solely as a
"collector" pursuant to Section 923(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code
and possessing only a Type 03 federal license.  The term "FIREARMS DEALER"
shall mean and include any "GUN SHOP" which term is defined as the premises
of any federally licensed firearms dealer where the purchase or sale of
firearms or firearms ammunition is conducted.



   (B)   A license is hereby required for any firearms dealer and/or
for the maintenance, operation or conduct of a gun shop business by a
firearms dealer within this village, or for doing such business or engaging
in any such activity or occupation within the village.  Any person, firm or
corporation shall be subject to such requirement if by himself or through an
agent, employer or partner he holds himself forth as being engaged in the
business or occupation, or solicits patronage therefor, actively or
passively; or attempts to perform any part of such business or occupation in
the village.  This chapter shall not apply to the one-time sale of the
personal gun of its owner; provided, however, if the same individual sells
six or more guns within any three year period, such person shall be
conclusively deemed to be conducting the business of a gun shop.  Possession
of a valid federal firearms dealer's license from an address or for a
location in the village shall be deemed proof of being engaged in the
business of dealing in firearms in the village and thus requiring a village
firearms dealer's license.  It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in
the business of dealing in firearms or maintaining a gun shop at any address
within the village without having first applied for and obtained a firearms
dealer's license pursuant to this provision.



   (C)   No license shall be provided for any location within the
village other than in an appropriately zoned business or commercial area.



   (D)   No license shall be provided for any location within
one-quarter of a mile of the grounds of a school (which means any public or
private elementary or secondary school, community college, college or
university) or public park (which means any land or building set aside for
public recreation and owned by a public park district), as measured from the
closest property lines of the respective properties (actual distance, ["as
the crow flies"] not by route of human travel), unless the entity which has
applied for a license was lawfully in business prior to September 15, 1994
and either is in its original location as of September 15, 1994 or relocates
to another location in the village with appropriate zoning for such business
and its uses.



   (E)   Any person in the village who becomes a federally licensed
firearms dealer after September 15, 1994 and is thus required under this
chapter to obtain a village firearms dealer's license shall apply for such
license within 45 days of receipt of the federal firearms dealer's license
(anyone who, as of September 1, 1994, has a federal firearms dealer's license
shall apply for such license within 45 days of September 1, 1994).  Any
persons licensed under federal law at more than one location within the
village must obtain a license from the village for each individual location
in the village.  A separate application license fee is required for each
location.  No license issued under this section shall be transferrable or
assignable to any other person or any other location.



   (F)   No license shall be issued hereunder to any person who fails
to provide proof of a valid federal firearms dealer's license and a valid
Firearm Owners Identification Card issued by the State of Illinois.

   (A)   The provisions of §§ 110.03 through 110.07, 110.09 and
110.10 shall apply to the required licenses for federal firearms dealers
and/or gunshops.  In addition, § 110.10(E)(6) which is incorporated herein
shall be and is hereby amended as incorporated herein to read, only in
relation to licenses issued under this chapter, in its entirety as follows:



   "Denial, suspension or revocation by any other public body of a
comparable license or permit for comparable or similar reasons as stated
above."



   (B)   Moreover, a license may be denied and/or suspended or revoked
if the licensee violated the provisions of § 133.41 of this code and/or any
other federal, state, county or local law dealing in any way whatsoever,
directly or indirectly, with the ownership, possession, sale or use of guns
(including discharge thereof).

fees and charges for such licenses shall be paid in advance at the time of
application.  All license fees shall become a part of the corporate fund of
this village.  In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any such
license fee, or any part thereof, for any reason including non-use of the
license and/or discontinuance of the operation or conduct of the regulated
business.

shall terminate on December 31 of each year.



   The Village Clerk shall mail to all licensees a notice of expiration
three weeks prior to the date of expiration.  A failure to send out the
notice, or the failing of the licensee to receive it, shall not excuse the
licensee from a failure to secure a new license, or a renewal thereof, nor it
shall be a defense in any action for operation without a license.

authorized in this chapter, the village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the village by telecommunications retailers.

shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer
who provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law
in the same manner as the original charge for such service.

may request, and the telecommunications retailer shall provide, written
substantiation for such credit.  However, no claim for such credit may be

      (1)   The credit is used only to offset a claim of
underpayment made by the village within the applicable statutory period of
limitations; and

telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.

retailers shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following

   (G)   The village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit
the books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this
chapter to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly
accounted to the village for the village infrastructure maintenance fee. 
Any underpayment of the amount of the village infrastructure maintenance fee
due to the village by the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the
village plus 5% of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an
audit, plus any costs incurred by the village in conducting the audit, in an
amount not to exceed 5% of the total amount of the underpayment determined in
an audit.  Said sum shall be paid to the village within 21 days after date
of issuance of an invoice for same.

§ 129F.08  CRIME-FREE LEASE ADDENDUM.



   Every lease or other agreement for rental of any residential property
entered into after the effective date of this chapter shall include a
"Crime-Free Lease Addendum" in substantially the following form, unless
otherwise prohibited by law:



 

   Crime-Free Lease Addendum

In addition to all other terms of the lease, Landlord and Tenant agree as
follows:

1.   The Tenant, any member of the Tenant’s household, any guest or any
other person associated with the Tenant on or near the leased premises:

      a)   Shall not engage in criminal activity, including
drug-related criminal activity, on or near the rental unit, common areas or
appurtenances. “Drug related criminal activity” means the illegal
manufacture, sale, distribution, use, or possession of any illegal or
controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

      b)   Shall not engage in any act intended to facilitate
criminal activity on or near the rental unit, common areas, or appurtenances.

damage.

SUBSTANTIAL VIOLATION OF THE LEASE, MATERIAL NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LEASE,
AND GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF TENANCY AND EVICTION. It is understood that a
single violation shall be good cause for immediate termination of the lease.
Proof of violation shall not require criminal conviction, but the Tenant
understands and agrees that an arrest or citation (supported by admissible
corroborating evidence that activity in violation of the above provisions has
occurred) for a described violation or criminal activity shall be sufficient
evidence of a violation and grounds for termination of Tenant’s tenancy and
occupancy. Corroborating evidence may include, but is not limited, to police
reports detailing the circumstances of the arrest, witness statements, and
other relevant documentation to assist in making a determination that the
conduct underlying the arrest occurred.



 

3.   A Tenant who is an innocent party or the victim of a crime, including

eviction. Nothing in this Addendum prohibits the eviction of the perpetrator
of the domestic violence, or sexual violence, or other criminal activity. A
TENANT IS  ENCOURAGED  TO  REPORT  CRIMES  WITHOUT FEAR OF HIS/HER
STATUS AS A TENANT.

4.   A Tenant will not be in violation of this Crime Free Lease Addendum
or subject to eviction based on:

violence or sexual violence against the tenant, household member, or guest
occurring in the rental unit or on the premise; or

      c)   Criminal activity or a local ordinance violation
occurring in the rental unit or on the premises that is directly relating to
domestic violence or sexual violence, engaged in by a tenant, member of a
tenant’s household, guest, or other party, and against a tenant, household
member, guest or other party.

VANDALISM AND PARENTAL IRRESPONSIBILITY



§ 131.15  PURPOSE.



   The corporate authorities find that the incidence of acts of vandalism
and similar offenses by juveniles resulting in damage to real and personal
property within this village have increased, thus posing a threat to the
value of the property within the village, and also threatening the general
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the village, and also
recognize the need to provide the means to eliminate such problems in order
to insure the safety of the property and residents of the village.  The
corporate authorities further find that increased parental responsibility is
essential for the effective control and elimination of such juvenile
offenses.  Furthermore, the corporate authorities further find that it is in
the best interests of the village that such acts be prosecuted by the village
as a local offense; that penalties therefore be imposed which are related to
the nature of the act and the type of offender; and that parents or legal
guardians of minors found guilty of such acts be held responsible for any
monetary penalty or order of restitution or reparation imposed.  The
diligent pursuit of such interest will tend to increase parental supervision
of minors and reduce the incidence of juvenile vandalism, thus advancing the
welfare of residents of the village.

§ 131.18  FINES, CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE AS REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION.



   Every person found guilty of an offense as defined in § 131.17 hereof
shall be subject to either or both of the following penalties for each
offense:



   (A)     A fine as specified in § 131.99.



   (B)     A period of conditional discharge not to exceed one year.



      (1)     The conditions of a conditional discharge shall
include that the defendant:



         (a)   Not violate any criminal statute of quasi-criminal
ordinance of any jurisdiction; and



         (b)   Report to and appear in person before such person

condition imposed for conditional discharge, the court:



         (a)     May order a summons to the offender to appear;
or order a warrant for the offender's arrest where there is a danger of his
fleeing the jurisdiction or causing serious harm to others or when the
offender fails to answer a summons.  The issuance of such warrant or summons
shall stay the sentence of conditional discharge until the final

run so long as the offender has not answered the summons or warrant.



         (b)     Shall conduct a hearing of the alleged
violation.  The court may admit the offender to bail pending the hearing.



         (c)     Shall receive evidence in the open court with
the right of confrontation, cross-examination, and representation by
counsel.  The village has the burden of going forward with the evidence and
proving the violation by the preponderance of the evidence.



         (d)     Shall not revoke a conditional discharge for
failure to comply with conditions of a sentence which imposed financial
obligations upon the offender unless such failure is due to his or her
willful refusal to pay.



         (e)     May modify the conditions of a conditional
discharge on motion of the village or in its own motion or at the request of
the offender after notice to all parties and a hearing.

it may continue to the offender on the existing period, with or without
modifying or enlarging the conditions, or may impose any other penalty that
was available at the time of the initial penalty.



      (6)     A judgment revoking probation or conditional
discharge is a final appealable order.



§ 131.19  OFFENSE OF PARENTAL IRRESPONSIBILITY.



   (A)     Offense.  It shall be unlawful for a parent or legal
guardian of an unemancipated minor residing with that parent or legal
guardian to fail to exercise proper parental responsibility by allowing or
permitting the minor to commit any violation of a village  ordinance or
state statute concerning vandalism, battery, curfew, disorderly conduct,
obscene conduct, trespass, graffiti, or possession or use of alcoholic
liquor, cannabis, or controlled substances, or any other offense of willful
or malicious acts to persons or property.



   (B)     Presumption.  A parent or legal guardian shall be presumed
to have allowed or permitted the minor to have committed a violation of a
village ordinance or state statute under all of the following conditions:



      (1)   The minor has been either adjudicated to be in the
violation of the provisions of § 131.17 above or § 131.20 below, or has
been charged with any such violation (except if found to be not guilty); or
has incurred non-judicial sanctions from any peace officer or conservator of
the peace resulting from an admission of guilt to any such offense; and



      (2)   The parent or legal guardian has received a written
notice by certified mail (return receipt requested) or by personal service in
substantially the following form:




LEGAL NOTICE




      TO:    (Parents' Names)



      FROM:  Village of Tinley Park



         You are hereby notified that                   
minor's name            has been involved with a violation of an
ordinance or state statute concerning vandalism, battery, curfew, disorderly
conduct, obscene conduct, trespass, graffiti, or possession or use of
alcoholic liquor, cannabis, or controlled substances, or any other offense of
willful or malicious acts to persons or property. If said minor is again
involved with a violation of one of the above-type ordinances or state
statutes you may be found guilty of the offense of parental
irresponsibility.  Conviction for said offense can result in a fine of not
less than $25 nor more than $500.  You are hereby notified that you must
exercise proper parental responsibility over said minor by controlling his
unlawful conduct.



      (3)     Said minor, within two years of the receipt of said
notice by the parent or legal guardian, has been either adjudicated to have
committed, has been charged with the violation (except if found not to be
guilty) of, or has admitted to have committed any violation of any ordinance
or state statute as described in (1) above.



   (C)     Notice.  It is the policy of the village that a parent or
legal guardian of a minor be notified and required to appear in court
whenever that minor is charged with a violation of an ordinance or state
statute which requires the minor's appearance in court.  To this end, it is
hereby directed that a notice in substantially the following form be sent to
the parents or legal guardians of the minor:




LEGAL NOTICE




               TO:    (Parents' Names)



               FROM:  Village of Tinley Park



   You are hereby notified that    minor's name    has been charged
with an offense which is a violation of a village ordinance or state statute
and which requires the appearance of said minor in court.  You are further
notified that one of the parents of said minor must appear in court before
the case will be tried or be disposed.



   If you fail to appear, the Village Prosecutor has been directed to have
issued a subpoena to bring you into court. Failure to obey a subpoena can
result in contempt of court, with a fine of imprisonment as the penalty.



   (D)     Subpoenas.  The Village Prosecutor is hereby directed to
have subpoenas issued whenever a parent or legal guardian of a minor does not
appear in court after the first two times the case has been before the court.

§ 131.20  GRAFFITI.



   (A)   Purpose and objectives.  The placement or maintenance of
graffiti anywhere within public view in the village poses a serious threat to
the orderly and proper maintenance of the village and to the safety, health,
and welfare of the general public.  Accordingly, the village has determined
that it is necessary to deal strictly with any person who commits or intends
to commit the offense of placing graffiti within public view in the village.
The village recognizes that the perpetrator is the principal offender under
this section, and thus intends that every such perpetrator be punished
accordingly.  The village also recognizes, however, that graffiti must be
eradicated and, therefore, that the owner or person in control of any
property or place on which graffiti has been placed in public view, while
also a victim, must be required to remove that graffiti for his or her own
good and for the protection of the safety, health, and welfare of all
residents of the village.  The purpose of this section is to prevent the
propagation of graffiti and to cause any graffiti that does appear to be
removed as quickly as possible, with the objective of protecting the public
safety, health, and welfare.



   (B)   Definition of graffiti.  For purposes of this section, the
word "GRAFFITI" shall mean any symbol, announcement, insignia, name
identification, inscription, picture, or similar marking, including without
limitation any letter, word, numeral, emblem, or combination thereof, that is
painted, written, drawn, scratched, etched, or in any other way placed on any
wall, fence, sign, building, or other structure, or sidewalk, pavement, post,
stone, tree, or any other real or personal property or place, private or
public, except as specifically permitted by state law or regulation or
Village Code, ordinance, or regulation.



   (C)   Graffiti prohibited.  It shall be unlawful for any person to
place graffiti upon the real or personal, public or private, property of
another without the express, written permission of the owner of said real or
personal property.



   (D)   Placement with owner's permission.  It shall be unlawful for
any owner/occupant or person having control of any real or personal property
which is in the public view within the village to place, permit, or otherwise
tolerate graffiti to be placed or to remain on that property or place if such
graffiti, as described in division (B), incites violence by reference to gang
or criminal activity, depicts or expresses obscenity by referring to sexual
activity, contains defamatory materials about a public or private person, or
is such that the Code Enforcement Commissioner, or his or her agent, in their
sole discretion, deems said graffiti to be inappropriate for the purposes
rendered.



   (E)   Possession of graffiti materials prohibited.  It shall be
unlawful for any person to possess any spray paint, paint, ink, marking pen
containing any nonwater soluble fluid, brush, applicator, or other tool or
material for painting, drawing, marking, scratching, or etching with the
intent to use such tool or material in violation of division (C) above.



   (F)   Duty to remove graffiti.  Every owner of any real or personal
property or place within the village, and every person having control of any
real or personal property or place within the village, shall remove, cover,
or otherwise eradicate, at his or her own expense, any graffiti that is
placed in public view on that property or place within three business days
after receipt of a notice from the village to do so.  Such notice from the
village shall describe the graffiti generally, shall order its immediate
removal by said third business day and shall set forth the possible results
of non-removal discussed in division (G) below.



   (G)   Nuisance declared.  Every violation of any provision of this
section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.  Where the owner or
other person upon whom notice was served pursuant to division (F) above,
fails to remove the graffiti described in the notice within seven days of
service of the notice, the village may take all such steps to remove, cover,
or otherwise eradicate or abate the graffiti in conformance with this section
and the nuisance abatement procedures set forth in §§ 98.35 through
98.37.  All costs incurred by the village in removing or otherwise abating
the graffiti shall be borne by the property owner and may be a lien on the
property as set forth in § 98.37 upon filing of a notice of lien.

§ 132.03  OBSCENITY.



   (A)     For the purpose of this section, a material or performance
is "OBSCENE" if:



      (1)     The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the
prurient interest;



      (2)     The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether
normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory
functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and



      (3)     Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value.



   (B)     A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the
nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable
inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he:



      (1)     Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to
sell, deliver, or provide any obscene writing, picture, record, or other
representation or embodiment of the obscene; or



      (2)     Presents or directs an obscene play, dance, or other
performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it
obscene; or

represented or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.



   (C)     Interpretation of evidence.



      (1)     Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary
adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other
specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the
material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed
for or directed to such an audience.



      (2)     Where circumstances of production, presentation,
sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is
being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such
evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can
justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value.



      (3)    In any prosecution for an offense under this section,
evidence shall be admissible to show:



         (a)     The character of the audience for which the
material was designed or to which it was directed;



         (b)     What the predominant appeal of the material
would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any,
it would probably have on the behavior of such people;



         (c)     The artistic, literary, scientific,
educational, or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;



         (d)     The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the
material in this state;



         (e)     Appeal to prurient interest, or absence
thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material;



         (f)     Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or

procurement, or possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of
obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the
possession of more than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie
evidence of an intent to disseminate.



   (E)     Affirmative defenses.  It shall be an affirmative defense
to obscenity that the dissemination:



      (1)     Was not for gain and was made to personal associates
other than children under 18 years of age;



      (2)     Was to institutions or individuals having scientific
or other special justification for possession of such material.



   (F)  Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted
previously of the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or
subsequent offense of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture
provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of
1963.



 



   (G)  Obscenity is a misdemeanor.  A second or subsequent offense is a

action for operation without a license.



   (G)   Any licensee who fails to pay the fees and charges for the
renewal of a license by January 31 of the year following expiration of the
license shall be charged a penalty of fifty dollars ($50). The penalty shall

discharge and dismissal under this section, unless the disposition of
supervision was for violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 §§ 3-707, 3-708,
3-710, 5-401.3, or 11-503, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a

be five years after discharge and dismissal, a person may have his record of
arrest expunged as may be provided by law. However, any defendant placed on
supervision before January 1, 1980, may move for expungement of his arrest
record, as provided by law, at any time after discharge and dismissal under
this section. A person placed on supervision for a sexual offense committed
against a minor as defined in subsection (g) of Section 5 of the Criminal
Identification Act (ILCS Ch. 20, Act 2630 § 5) or for a violation of ILCS
Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-501 shall not have his or her record of arrest sealed or
expunged.

of appeal.



   (I)   The court shall require a defendant placed on supervision for
possession of a substance prohibited by the Cannabis Control Act or Illinois
Controlled Substances Act after a previous conviction or disposition of
supervision for possession of a substance prohibited by the Cannabis Control
Act or Illinois Controlled Substances Act or a sentence of probation under
ILCS Ch. 720, Act 550 § 10 or ILCS Ch. 720, Act 570 § 410 and after a
finding by the court that the person is addicted, to undergo treatment at a
substance abuse program approved by the court.

shall be fined as provided in § 133.99.



   (B)     Sentence of supervision.  The court may impose a sentence

§ 133.36  DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS.



   (A)   (1)   It shall be unlawful to discharge any firearms or
airguns in the village; provided that this section shall not be construed to
prohibit any officer of the law to discharge a firearm in the performance of
his or her duty; nor to any citizen to discharge one when lawfully defending
his or her person or property.



      (2)   Exceptions. This section shall not be applicable to a
person or persons operating an air gun, paintball gun, or BB or pellet gun at
a place of recreation, carnival booth, paintball course or shooting range
which has been duly inspected and licensed by the village.



   (B)   It shall be unlawful to carry on any public road or way in the
village, whether concealed or unconcealed, any firearm or airgun other than
in compliance with the hunting and game laws of the state; provided that this
section shall not be construed to prohibit any officer of law to carry
firearms as are necessary in the performance of his duty.



   (C)   Any person convicted of a violation of either division (A) or
(B) above shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 nor more than

number of hours as determined by the court.



   (E)   In light of the nature of the violations set forth in
divisions (A) and (B) above, the alleged violation of either division (A) or
(B) is much greater than the expense of law enforcement responses to more
minor violations.  As such, in addition to any penalty as set forth in
divisions (C) and (D) above, any person found guilty of a violation of either
division (A) or (B) shall be required to reimburse the village, as well as
any other law enforcement agency responding to the violation in conjunction
with the village, for the actual costs and expenses incurred by the village
and any other law enforcement agency in regard to the incident that was the
basis for the finding of guilty.  In regard to the reimbursement, the Chief
of Police is hereby directed to prepare an affidavit as to the costs/expenses
of any such incident, and present same to the court against the person found
guilty.  This division shall be applicable to all future violations of
either division (A) or (B), as well as all pending cases under division (A)
or (B) for which there has not been a final adjudication as of the effective
date of this division, April 17, 1993.

deadly weapons in the village without first being licensed to do so by the
village, as well as by appropriate federal and state authorities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the giving away of any such dangerous or
deadly weapon shall not be prohibited if it is given away free as a prize or
an award by a private club or an association at a banquet, benefit, annual
dinner, or similar event, but no such private club or association shall be
permitted to do so more than twice a year.  Also, as provided in § 128.01
of this code, the provisions of this section shall not apply to the one-time
sale of the personal gun of its owner; provided, however, if the same
individual sells six or more guns within any three year period, such person
shall be conclusively deemed to be conducting the business of a gunshop.

§ 150.01  INSPECTION PROCEDURE; ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF SAFETY.



   (A)     (1)     Every elevator, escalator, and other similar
equipment designed or used for the movement of passengers either as its main
or sole purpose or in conjunction with the movement of freight or other
commodities, now in operation or which may hereafter be installed, together
with all equipment thereof, shall be inspected at least once every six
months, and in no case shall any new equipment be placed into operation until
an inspection of the same has been made.  It shall be the duty of each
owner, agent, lessee, and occupant of any building wherein any equipment is
installed, and of the person in charge or in control of any such equipment,
to permit the making of a test of that equipment and all devices used in
connection therewith, upon demand being made by the Building Commissioner, or
by his duly authorized elevator inspector, within five days after such demand
has been made.



      (2)     Whenever any elevators, escalators, or other similar
equipment, and all devices and equipment used in connection therewith, have
been inspected, and all required tests have been made of all safety devices
with which that equipment is equipped, and the result of the inspection and
tests show that equipment, including all safety devices, to be in good
working condition and in good repair, it shall be the duty of the Building
Commissioner to issue or cause to be issued a certificate setting forth the
result of the inspection and tests and containing the date of inspection, the
weight which the equipment will safely carry, and a statement to the effect
that the elevator complies with all village requirements.  It shall be the
joint and several duty of the owner, agent, lessee, or occupant of the
building in which that equipment is located, and of each person in charge or
control of the equipment, to frame the certificate and place the same in a
conspicuous place in each elevator and near each escalator or other
equipment. The words "SAFE CONDITION" in this chapter means that it is safe
for any load up to the approved weight indicated in the certificate.



   (B)     If the result of the inspection or tests required under
division (A) above show that the elevator, escalator, or other equipment is
in an unsafe condition or bad repair, or shows that any of the safety devices
have not been installed or if installed are not in good working order or not
in good repair, the certificate provided for in division (A) above shall not
be issued until that elevator, escalator, or other equipment, or other
devices, have been put in good working order and good repair.

§ 150.02  EQUIPMENT FOUND TO BE IN UNSAFE CONDITION.



   When the elevator inspector finds any elevator or escalator or other
equipment in an unsafe condition, he shall immediately report the same to the
Building Commissioner, together with a statement of all facts relating to the
condition of the equipment.  It shall be the duty of the Building
Commissioner, upon receiving any report, to order the operation of the
equipment to be stopped and to remain inoperative until it has been placed in
a safe condition and in good operating condition.  It shall be unlawful for
any agent, owner, lessee, or occupant of any building wherein any equipment
is located, and of each person in charge or control of that equipment, to
permit or allow the same to be used after receipt of a notice from the
Building Commissioner, which notice shall be in writing, that the equipment
is in an unsafe condition, and it will remain so unlawful until it has been
restored to a safe and proper operating condition.



(Ord. 84-0-003, passed 8-14-84)  Penalty, see § 150.99



§ 150.03  INSPECTION FEES.



   The fee for the semi-annual inspection of an elevator or escalator or
other equipment shall be $35, which fee shall be the joint and several
obligation of the owner, agent, lessee, and occupant of any building wherein
the equipment is installed.  An additional fee of $35 shall be charged for
each additional inspection which may be required because the initial
inspection indicated the elevator or escalator or other equipment to not be
in a safe or good operating condition.



(Ord. 84-0-003, passed 8-14-84)



§ 150.99  PENALTY.



   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.  Each day a
violation continues or occurs shall be considered a separate offense. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any other legal remedies
as may be available to the village under the provisions of the building code
or as otherwise provided by law.

§ 151.01  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The Village President and Board of Trustees of the village
find as follows:



      (1)   Excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that
are undergoing development for certain non-agricultural uses, including but
not limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and
industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, filling of land, and
the creation of recreational facilities;



      (2)   The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across
and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by
decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles;



      (3)   Said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of
gulleys, washed-out fills, and embankments;



      (4)   The sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers
and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs;



      (5)   Said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for
most beneficial purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life, and that
said sediment is costly and difficult to remove; and



      (6)   Said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways,
resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public
health and safety.



   (B)   The Mayor and Board of Trustees therefore declare that the
purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons,
to protect property and prevent the despoliation of the environment, and to
promote the public welfare, by regulating and controlling the design,
construction, quality of materials and use and maintenance of any development
or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results
in the movement of earth on land situated in the village.

§ 151.05  GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.



   Unless judged by the village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management
at all sites:



   (A)   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible,
establish storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of
storm water discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the
generation of storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize
pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff
from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to
the maximum extent practical.



   (B)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific
channel protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the Illinois
Urban Manual.



   (C)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement
a storm water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent
(NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) general permit. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.



   (D)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the
village to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design
requirements.



   (E)   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the
MWRDGC shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices where
applicable.



(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)



§ 151.06  BASIC STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.



   (A)   Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture
storm water runoff pollutants.  In particular, designers shall give
preference to wet bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent to or near
existing wetlands or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to
the village and all flows from the development shall be routed through the
basin.



   (B)   Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain
developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the
village.  Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted
throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water
runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.



   (C)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation, wetlands, and water
quality mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions of the
property exclusively for storm water management.



(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)



§ 151.07  POST CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT.



   (A)   The requirements of Section IV (D)(2)(b) of NPDES permit No.
ILR10 including management practices, controls and other provisions at least
as protective as the requirements contained in the Illinois Urban Manual,
2002 or most recent edition.



   (B)   The long-term operation and maintenance of all BMP's shall be
provided.



(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)



§ 151.08  WAIVERS TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Waiver eligibility criteria.  Every applicant shall provide
for storm water management as required by this chapter, unless this
requirement is waived by the village.  The minimum requirements for storm
water management may be waived in whole or in part upon request of the
applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:



      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is
not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.



      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management
of storm water discharges have been established in a storm water management
plan that has been approved by the village and the implementation of the plan
is required by local ordinance.



      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to
or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there
is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and
maintenance of the storm water practice.



      (4)   The village finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site.



      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on the sites that
reduce: the generation of storm water from the site; the size and cost of
storm water storage; and the pollutants generated at the site. These
nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the Illinois Urban Manual.



   (B)   Assurances required for waiver.  In instances where one of
the conditions above applies, the village may grant a waiver from strict
compliance with these storm water management provisions, as long as
acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a
variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village
that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream
waterway:

   (A)   Applicability.  All earth moving grading and grading
operations not specifically exempted by the provisions of this chapter shall
comply with the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this
section in addition to the other requirements of this chapter.



   (B)   Handbook adopted by reference.  The standards and
specifications of the Illinois Urban Manual are hereby incorporated into this
section and made a part hereof by this reference, for the purpose of
delineating procedures and methods of operation under development plans
approved in § 151.04 and methods of operation under development plans
approved in § 151.04.  In the event of conflict between provisions of the
said manual and other provisions of this chapter, the said provisions of this
chapter shall govern.  The village "Erosion Control Practice Standards" are
hereby incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by this
reference, for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation
under development plans approved in § 151.04 and methods of operation under
development plans approved in § 151.04.  In the event of conflict between
provisions of the said standards and other provisions of this chapter, the
said provisions of this chapter shall govern.



   (C)   Special precautions.



      (1)   If at any stage of the grading the Village Engineer or
Director of Public Works determines by inspection that the nature of the
formation is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is
likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure
they may require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such
reasonable safety precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the
likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be
limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, leveling, or cribbing,
installation of plant materials for erosion control and reports of a
registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made
requirements for further work.



      (2)   Where it appears that flood damage may result because
the grading is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required
to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary
structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual
site conditions prevail, the Village Engineer or Director of Public Works may
specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require
that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure
completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal
rains.



   (D)   Expiration of permit.  Every site development permit shall
expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such
permit has not been commenced within 180 days, or is not completed within one
year from date of issue; except that the Director of Public Works may, if the
permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have
prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits,
grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before
the expiration date of the permit.

§ 152.01  PURPOSE.



   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this
village by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5 §§ 1-2-1, 11-12-12, 11-30-8, and 11-31-2. 
The purpose of this chapter is to maintain this village's eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to
periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve
economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and
related land resources.  This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the
following specific purposes:



   (A)   To meet the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5 § 18(g), an
Act in Relation to the Regulation of Rivers, Lakes and Streams of the State
of Illinois, approved June 10, 1911, as amended.



   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;



   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings
from flood damage;



   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;



   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control
projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood
rescue and relief operations; and



   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.



   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended.



   (H)   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of
land and water resources;



   (I)   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic
habitats;



   (J)   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in
order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce
soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development

      (3)   To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site,
the regulatory floodway boundary should be scaled off the regulatory floodway
map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps.
Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the
regulatory floodway boundary, the Division should be contacted for the
interpretation.



   “REPAIR, REMODELING OR MAINTENANCE.”  Development activities which
do not result in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any
changes to the dimensions of a structure.



   “RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY.”  A “RETENTION FACILITY” stores
stormwater runoff without a gravity release.  A “DETENTION FACILITY”
provides for storage of stormwater runoff and controlled release of this
runoff during and after a flood or storm.



   “RIVERINE SFHA.”  Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river,
creek, intermittent stream, ditch, on stream lake system or any other
identified channel.  This term does not include areas subject to flooding
from lakes, ponding areas, areas of sheet flow or other areas not subject to
overbank flooding.



   “RUNOFF.”  The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on
the land surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in
channels or conduits.



   “SEDIMENTATION.”  The processes that  deposit soils, debris and
other materials either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or
watercourses.



   “SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).”  Any base flood area subject
to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent stream, ditch or any other
identified channel or ponding and shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or
Flood Insurance Rate Map as Zone A, A0, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V30, VE, V, M
or E.

home or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days, unless
they are fully licensed and ready for highway use.



   “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.”  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure either, before the
improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged from
any source, and is being restored, the damage occurred.  This term includes
structures which were damaged whereby the cost of restoring the structure to
its predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value before
the damage occurred, regardless of the actual repair work performed.  For
the purposes of this definition “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT” is considered
to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.  The term does not,
however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply
with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration
of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic  Places or a
State Inventory of Historic Places.

§ 152.03 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.



   This chapter's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance
Study for the village.  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency
flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection
standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the
Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository.  When a
party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit
it to DWR and FEMA.



   (A)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHAs of Midlothian Creek, Midlothian Creek Western Tributary, 76th Avenue
Ditch, Filsen Park Ditch, Union Drainage Ditch, Union Drainage Ditch Northern
Tributary, and Flossmoor Ditch shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 19, 2008, and as
delineated on the 100-year profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study
for Will County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated
November 6, 2000, and such amendments to such studies and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.



   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook and Will Counties that are within
the one and one-half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or may
be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 19, 2008, and as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance
Study for Will County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
dated November 6, 2000, and such amendments to such studies and maps as may
be prepared from time to time.



   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map of the village or those parts of unincorporated Cook and Will County
that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may
be annexed into the village shall be according to the best existing data
available in the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information
Repository.  When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine
SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2 or a
dynamic model such as HIP.  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models
shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I TR-20, or HIP, or by
techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States
Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be
based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as
determined from adopted local and regional land use plans.  Along any
watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be
submitted to DWR for approval once approved it must be submitted to the
Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. 
For a nonriverine SFHA,the base flood elevation shall be the historic Flood
of Record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study
and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey.

§ 152.04  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  This
chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage.  This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

§ 152.05  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions.  Where this chapter and other
ordinance, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.  This
chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was
adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not
intended to repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to
establish initial eligibility for the program.

DEVELOPMENT IN SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS



§ 152.20  OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.



   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of this
chapter are met.  No use will be permitted which adversely affects the
capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the
flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the
requirements of §152.23.



   (A)   Development permit.  No person, firm, corporation or
governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in
the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Director of
Community Development.



      (1)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a
form provided by the Director of Community Development.  The application
shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing
property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by
a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in
M.S.L., (1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD and all changes in grade resulting
from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and
additions to buildings.  For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on
the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements
of §152.23.



      (2)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the
Director of Community Development shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  Any development
located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood
elevation as of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is
not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter.  The Director of Community Development shall maintain documentation
of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification
that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first
Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.



      (3)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures.  Shall be as
detailed in Chapter 151, Erosion and Sedimentation Control.



      (4)   The Director of Community Development shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local,
state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may
be required for this type of activity.  The Director of Community
Development shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and
federal permits have been obtained.



   (B)   Preventing increased damages.  No development in the flood
fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.



      (1)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.



      (2)   Compensatory storage.  Whenever any portion of a
floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied
by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a
hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  The excavation volume shall be at
least equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.  In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.  All floodplain storage lost
below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed ten-year flood elevation.  All floodplain storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

activity.  The Director of Community Development shall not issue the
development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been
obtained.  A registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract
of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this
section.



   (B)   Preventing increased damages and a use of appropriate uses.



      (1)   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed
are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions
of the floodway or channel, or permanently  impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat.  Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.  Only those appropriate
uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code 708 will be allowed.  Appropriate uses do
not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill,
building additions, buildings on stilts, fencing (including landscaping or
planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as
specifically defined above as an appropriate use.  The approved appropriate
uses are as follows:



         (a)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other
public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage,
flooding, erosion or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.



         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of,
or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment
facilities, and facilities  and improvements related to recreational
boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;



         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;



         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;



         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and
trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed
from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and
including open air pavilions;



         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other
nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing
buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;



         (g)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways,
runways and taxiways and any modification thereto;



         (h)   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where
depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0
foot) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation;



         (i)   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to
create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse.



         (j)   Flood proofing activities to protect previously
existing lawful structures including the construction of water tight window
wells, elevating structures or construction of floodwalls around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the
existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to
the structure.



         (k)   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings,
reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50%
of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and
which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.



      (1)   Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do
not increase the building's foot and are valued at less than 50% of the
market value of the building.



      (2)   Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the
regulatory floodway maps designated by DWR, the construction of an
appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed
project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a
registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the
protection requirements of §152.23:



         (a)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to
increase flood stages upstream.  For appropriate uses other than bridge or
culvert crossings on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory
floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood.  In calculating
effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be
taken into consideration:



            1.   Regulatory floodway conveyance,



   "K"=(1.486/n) AR2/3



where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the
cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. 
(See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill  Book Company,
New York).



            2.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used
for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance
agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can assure the
proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a
vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover.



            3.   Transition sections shall be provided and
used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The
following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an
applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or
model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:



               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow
section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster
than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded
stream's length.



               b.   When water is flowing from a wide
section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no
faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the
flooded stream's length.



               c.   When expanding or contracting flows in
a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten
feet of stream length shall be used.



               d.   Transition sections shall be provided
between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when
meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties.



               e.   All cross-sections used in the
calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.



         (b)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to
increase downstream flooding.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for
any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume
of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control
projects.  Compensatory storage or fill or structures shall be equal to the
volume of floodplain storage lost.  Artificially created storage lost due to
a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be
replaced.  The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation.  All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood
elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.  If the compensatory storage will not be placed
at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer 
shall demonstrate to DWR through a determination of flood discharges and
water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically
equivalent.  Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area
as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary
to reduce flooding at existing structure.



         (c)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to
increase stream erosion or flood heights.  For all appropriate uses, except
bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway
velocities.  However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream
structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if
scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or
other design measures.



         (d)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings
and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an
increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the
existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained
within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the
channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees
or flood walls or within recorded flood easements.  If the proposed
construction will increase upstream flood stages greater an 0.1 feet, the
developer must contact DWR, Dam Safety Section for a dam safety permit or
waiver.



            1.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood
stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding
flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
152.03.  Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart
for the Selection of Highway Culverts.  Bridges must be analyzed using the
U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways
calculation procedures.



            2.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for
per division (B)(2)(b) of this section.



            3.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per
division (B)(2)(c) of this section.



            4.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater
caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory
profile must be submitted to DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required
by division (B) of this section.



            5.   All excavations for the construction of the
crossing shall be designed per division (B)(2)(h) of this section.



         (e)   Reconstruction or modification of existing
bridges, culverts and approach roads.



            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach
reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1
foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood
frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure
is not a source of flood damage.



            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway
approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the
upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility
of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into
consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.



            3.   The determination as to whether or not the
existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must
be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 92 Ill.
Adm. Code 708 (Floodway Construction  in Northeastern  Illinois) and
submitted to the Division for review and concurrence before a permit is
issued.



         (f)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0
foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements.  A permit or letter indicating a permit is
not required must be obtained from DWR, Dam Safety Section for a dam safety
permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water
in the stream during normal or flood  flow.  All dams and impoundment
structures as defined in § 152.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of
92 Ill. Adm. Code 702  (Construction  and Maintenance of Dams).  If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:



            1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the
public interest by providing flood control, public recreation or regional
stormwater detention;



            2.   The impoundment will not prevent the
migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas
as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning;



            3.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute
to degraded water quality or habitat conditions.  Impoundment design should
include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a
pre-sedimentation basin.



            4.   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of this section.



         (g)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential
and commercial structures.  If the construction is required beyond the
outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the
floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the
outside of the building.  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will
not be required for floodproofing activities.



         (h)   Excavation in the floodway.  When excavation is
proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the
modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures,
or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition
sections shall be provided for the excavation.  The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:



            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section
to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's
length;



            2.   When water is from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and



            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a
vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten
feet of stream length shall be used.



            4.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided
inland upstream



and downstream of the transition sections.



         (i)   Seeding and stabilization plan.  For all
activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be
submitted by the applicant.



         (j)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures.  Shall
be as detailed in Chapter 151, Erosion and Sedimentation Control.



         (k)   Public flood control projects.  For public flood
control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be
considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and
hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or
cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project
right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to an including the
100-year frequency event.



         (l)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.



            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data
in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in § 152.03, must be used for
analysis of the base conditions.  If the study data appears to be in error
or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for approval and
concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.



            2.   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation
at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a
downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed
construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the
100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and
conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.



            3.   If the applicant learns from DWR, local
governments or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or
culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional
flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or
modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be 
analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the
existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the
bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.



         (m)   Conditional Letter of Map revision.  If the
appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location
or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DWR
and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be
issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from DWR a
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued.  However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by
DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by
FEMA and DWR.  In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated area shall concur with
the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before DWR approval
can be given.  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.  No further development activities
shall take place until a final Letter of Map revision (LOMR) is issued by
FEMA and DWR.



         (n)   Professional engineer's supervision.  All
engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a
registered professional engineer.



      After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision,
construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may
proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map
is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received.  The regulatory
floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR and FEMA
of the “as-built” plans.



         (3)   State review.  For those projects listed below
located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted
to DWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:



            (a)   DWR will review an engineer's analysis of
the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to division (B)(2)(d) of
this section.



            (b)   DWR will review an engineer's determination
that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage
and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to division
(B)(2)(e) of this section.



            (c)   The DWR will review alternative transition
sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to division (B)(2)(a),
(b) and (h) of this section.



            (d)   The DWR will review and approve prior to the
start of construction any Department projects, dams (as defined in § 152.02)
and all other state, federal and local units of government projects,
including projects of the municipality or county.



         (4)   Other permits.  In addition to the other
requirements of this chapter, a development permit for a site located in a
floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or
written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR, issued pursuant
to ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5 §5 et seq.  No permit from DWR shall be required if
the Division has delegated this responsibility to the village.



         (5)   Dam safety permits.  Any work involving the
construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in § 152.02 per
Ill. Adm. Code 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an Illinois
Division of Water Resources Dam Safety permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam.  If the Director of Community Development finds a dam
that does not have a DWR permit, the Director of Community Development shall
immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of the Division of Water
Resources.  If the Director of Community Development finds a dam which is
believed to be in unsafe condition, the Director of Community Development
shall immediately notify the owner of the dam; DWR, Dam Safety Section in
Springfield; and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).



         (6)   Activities that do not require a registered
professional engineer's review.  The following activities may be permitted
without a registered professional engineers review.  Such activities shall
still meet the other requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation
requirements.



            (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:



               1.   Do not result in any increase in
existing ground elevations,



               2.   Do not require the  placement of above
ground structures in the floodway, or



               3.   In the case of underground stream
crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three
feet below the existing stream bed, and



               4.   In the case of overhead utilities, no
supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a
fashion as not to catch debris.



            (b)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:



               1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of
the existing adjacent natural bank slope, and



               2.   Do not result in an increase in ground
elevation, and



               3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream
erosion at the outfall location.



            (c)   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields
(excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at
grade.



            (d)   Construction of shoreline and streambank
protection that:



               1.   Does not exceed 1000 feet in length.



               2.   Materials are not placed higher than
the existing top of bank.



               3.   Materials are placed so as not to
reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake.



               4.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual
side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion
problems.  Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action
necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or
rip-rap are preferred materials.  Artificial materials such as concrete,
construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.

§ 152.22  OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS
ARE NOT IDENTIFIED.



   (A)   In SFHA or floodplains, where no floodways have identified and
no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations havebeen established by
FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted
unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede
or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly
increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.



      (1)   Development permit.



         (a)   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body,
not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the Director of
Community Development.  Application for a development permit shall be made
on a form provided by the Director of Community Development.  The
application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale
showing property line dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all
changes in grade resulting from evacuation or filling, sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or surveyor, the location and dimensions of all buildings
and additions to buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of § 152.23.



         (b)   The application for a development permit shall
also include the following information:



            1.   A detailed description of the proposed
activity, its purpose and intended use;



            2.   Site location (including the legal
description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway
maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or
unincorporated area;



            3.   Anticipated dates of initiation and
completion of activity;



            4.   Plans of the proposed activity shall be
provided which include as a minimum:



               a.   A vicinity map showing the site of the
activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the
vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale and north arrow.



               b.   A plan view of the project and
engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including
principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level
(1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership,
drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed activity and
navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially
navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of
cross-sections, north arrow and a graphical or numerical scale;



               c.   Cross-section views of the project and
engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including
principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed
elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation,
100-year frequency flood elevation and graphical or numerical scales
(horizontal and vertical); and



            5.   Engineering calculations and supporting data
shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of
division (B) of this section.



            6.   Any and all other local, state and federal
permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development.



      (2)   Based on the best available existing data according to
the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository, the
Director of Community Development shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  Should no elevation
information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the
elevation according to § 152.03(C).  Any development located on land that
can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the
sites first Flood Insurance Rate Map Identification is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the  requirements of this chapter.  The Building
Commissioner shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at
the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed
prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.



      (3)   The Director of Community Development shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state
and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be
required for this type of activity.  The Director of Community Development
shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and
federal permits have been obtained.



   (B)   Preventing increased damages.  No development in the SFHA,
where a has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and
safety.



      (1)   Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not
been determined, the following standards shall apply:



         (a)   The developer shall have a registered professional
engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and
data that the project meets the engineering requirements of §
152.21(B)(2)(a) through (l) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of § 152.03(C).  As an alternative, the developer should have an
engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that
engineering study to DWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway.  Upon
acceptance of their floodway by the Department, the developer shall then
demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of § 152.21 for the
regulatory  floodway.  The floodway shall be defined according to the
definition in § 152.02.



         (b)   A development permit shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a
permit is not required from the DWR.



         (c)   No permit from DWR shall be required if the
Division has delegated permit responsibility to the village per 92 Ill. Adm.
Code, Part 708 for regulatory floodways, per DWR's statewide permit entitled
“Construction in Floodplains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern
Illinois.”



         (d)   Dam safety permits.  Any work involving the
construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to
impound water as defined in § 152.02 shall obtain an Illinois Division of
Water Resources Dam Safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required prior to the start of construction of a dam.  If the Director of
Community Development finds a dam that does not have an DWR permit, the
Director of Community Development shall immediately notify the Dam Safety
Section of the Division of Water Resources.  If the Director of Community
Development finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the
Director of Community Development shall immediately notify the owner of the
dam; DWR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield; and the Illinois Emergency
Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).



         (e)   The following activities may be permitted without
a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood
elevation and regulatory floodway.  Such activities shall still meet the
other requirements of this chapter:



            1.   Underground and overhead utilities that:



               a.   Do not result in any increase in
existing ground elevations,



               b.   Do not require the placement of above
ground structures in the floodway, or



               c.   In the case of underground stream
crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three
feet below the existing streambed, and



               d.   In the case of overhead utilities, no
supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a
fashion as not to catch debris.



            2.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:



               a.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of
the existing adjacent natural bank slope,



               b.   Do not result in an increase in ground
elevation, and



               c.   Are designed so as not to cause
streambank erosion at the outfall location.



            3.   Construction of shoreline and streambed
protection that:



               a.   Does not exceed 1000 feet in length or
two cubic yards per lineal foot of streambed.



               b.   Materials are not placed higher than
the existing top of bank.



               c.   Materials are placed so as not to
reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than 10%.



            4.   The construction of light poles, sign posts
and similar structures;



            5.   The construction of sidewalks, driveways,
athletic fields (excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are

carports built at or below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of
flood waters;



            7.   The placement of properly anchored buildings
not exceeding 70 square feet in size, nor ten feet in any one dimension (for
example, animal shelters and tool sheds);



            8.   The construction of additions to existing
buildings which



do not increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which are located on
the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not
extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the
flow of flood waters;



            9.   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream 
channel where:



               a.   The affected length of stream is less
than 1000 feet.



               b.   The work is confined to reestablishing
flows in natural stream channels, or



               c.   The cross-sectional area of the dredged
channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of
the site.



         (f)   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or
relocated watercourse shall be maintained.



      (2)   Compensatory storage.  Whenever any portion of a
floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied
by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a
hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  The excavation volume shall be at
least equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.  In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.  All floodplain storage lost
below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed ten-year flood elevation.  All floodplain storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

§ 152.23  PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOOD PLAIN AREAS;
PROTECTION OF BUILDING.



   In addition to the requirements found in §§ 152.20 through 152.22 for
development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways and SFHA or floodplains
where no floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99,
VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements shall be met.



   (A)   Public health standards.



      (1)   No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or
storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers,
flammable liquids, pollutants or other hazardous or toxic materials below the
floodplain elevation.



      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells,
sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted
providing all manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE
are watertight.



   (B)   Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving
channel modification, fill or stream maintenance (including levees), the
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained.  In
addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days
prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the
watercourse.



   (C)   Protecting buildings.  All buildings located within a
100-year floodplain also known as a SFHA, shall be protected from flood
damage below the flood protection elevation.  However, existing buildings
located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive
appropriate use standards included in § 152.21.  This building protection
criteria applies to the following situations:



      (1)   Construction or placement of a new building.



      (2)   A structural alteration to an existing building that
either increases the first floor area by more than 20% or the building's
market value by more than 50%. This alteration shall be figured cumulatively,
beginning with any alteration which has taken place subsequent to April 1,
1990.



      (3)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site.  This building protection requirement
does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and



      (4)   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days.



   (D)   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the
following methods.



      (1)   A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed,
may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following:



         (a)   The lowest floor, (including basement) shall be at
or above the flood protection elevation.



         (b)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than
one foot deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond
the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection
elevation.  The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection
elevation.  However, the ten foot minimum may be waived if a structural
engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures.  The fill shall be protected against erosion
and scour.  The fill shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.



      (2)   A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated
in accordance with the following:



         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on
crawl space, stilts, piles, walls or other foundation that is permanently
open to flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood.  The permanent openings shall be
no more than one foot above existing grade and no higher than the existing
BFE, and consists of a minimum of two openings.  The openings must have a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation.



         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be
anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so
as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves,
ice and floating debris.



         (c)   All areas below the flood protection elevation
shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage.  The lowest
floor (including the basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located

§ 152.35  DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT; DUTIES.



   The Director of Community Development shall be responsible for
fulfilling all of the duties listed in division (B) of this section.



      (1)   To fulfill those duties, the Director of Community
Development first should use the criteria listed in § 152.03, Base Flood
Elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a
floodplain.  Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the Director of Community Development must determine whether the
development site is within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within a
SFHA or floodplain on which no floodway has been identified.  If the site is
within a flood fringe, the Director of Community Development shall require
that the minimum requirements of § 152.20 be met.  If the site is within a
floodway, the Director of Community Development shall require that the
minimum requirements of § 152.21 be met.  If the site is located within a
SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and
approved, the Director of Community Development shall require that the
minimum requirements of § 152.22 be met.  In addition, the general
requirements of §152.23 shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of §§ 152.20 through 152.22.  The Director of Community
Development shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the
requirements of § 152.24.



      (2)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the
Director of Community Development shall review the requirements of § 152.36
to make sure they are met.  In addition, the Director of Community
Development shall complete all notification requirements.



      (3)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits
as required in this chapter, the Director of Community Development may take
any and all actions as outlined in § 152.99.



   (B)   The Director of Community Development shall be responsible for
the general administration and enforcement of this chapter which shall
include the following:



      (1)   Determining the floodplain designation.  Check all new
development sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard
Area (SFHA).  If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a
floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not
been conducted which drains more than one square mile.



      (2)   Professional engineer review.  If the development site
is within a floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not
been conducted which drains more than one square mile then the permit shall
be referred to a registered professional engineer (P.E.) under the employ or
contract of the village for review to ensure that the development meets the
requirements of § 152.21.  In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E.
shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of §
152.21.



      (3)   Dam safety requirements.  Ensure that a DWR Dam Safety
permit has been issued or a letter indicating no dam safety permit is
required if the proposed development activity includes construction of a dam
as defined in § 152.02.  Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures.



      (4)   Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all
required federal, state &nd local permits are received prior to the issuance
of a floodplain development permit.



      (5)   Plan review and permit issuance.  Ensure that all
development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village
meet the requirements of this chapter and issue a floodplain development
permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other
regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of
this chapter.



      (6)   Inspection review.  Inspect all development projects
before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the
structure and to ensure they comply with  the provisions of this chapter.



      (7)   Elevation and floodproofing certificates.  Maintain in
the permit files an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the
lowest floor (including the basement) of a residential  or nonresidential
building or the elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to
§ 152.23 for public inspection and provide copies of same.



      (8)   Records for public inspection. Maintain for public
inspection and furnish up on request base flood data, SFHA and regulatory
floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance
documentation, Conditional Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision,
Letter of Map Amendment and “as built” elevation and floodproofing or
elevation and floodproofing certificates for all buildings constructed
subject to this chapter.



      (9)   State permits.  Ensure that construction authorization
has been granted by the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of
Water Resources, for all development projects subject to §§ 152.21 and
152.22, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the
village.  Upon acceptance of this chapter by DWR and FEMA, responsibility is
hereby delegated to the village as per 92 Ill. Adm. Code 708 for 
construction in the regulatory floodway and floodplain when floodways have
not been defined in §§ 152.21 and 152.22.  However, the following review
approvals are not delegated to the village and shall require review or
permits from DWR:



         (a)   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter,
as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes;



         (b)   Department of Transportation projects, dams or
impoundment structures as defined in § 152.02 and all other state, federal
or local unit of government projects, including projects of the village and
county, except for those projects meeting the requirements of § 152.21(B)(6);



         (c)   An engineer's determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, per § 152.21(B)(2)(e);



         (d)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to
§ 152.21(B)(2)(d);



         (e)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically
equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in § 152.21(B)(2)(a), (b) and
(h);

§ 152.36  VARIANCES.



   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a
regulatory floodway as defined in § 152.02.  However, when a development
proposal is located outside a regulatory floodway, and whenever the standards
of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the
applicant may apply to the Director of Community Development for a
variance.  The Director of Community Development shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
Board of Trustees.



   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
SFHA;



      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance was
not granted;

      (8)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not
represent a general problem; and



      (9)   The granting of the variance will not alter the
essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses.



   (B)   The Director of Community Development shall notify an
applicant in



writing that a variance from the requirements of § 152.23 lessen the degree
of protection to a building will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;



      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk
and liability.



   (C)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site
or building listed on the National Register of Historical Places or
documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation
Agency may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§ 152.24(A) and (B).

variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter.  Upon
due investigation, the Director of Community Development may determine that a
violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exist.  The Director of
Community Development shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.



   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the
violation:



      (1)   The Village may make application to the circuit court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter.



      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined not less than $50 or more than $1,000 for each
offense.



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.



      (4)   The village may record a notice of violation on the
title to the property.



   (B)   The Director of Community Development shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.



   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations.  All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 153.01  PURPOSE.



   The standards used in displaying signs can significantly affect the
public safety as well as the value and economic stability of adjoining
property.  However, a reasonable display of signs is necessary as a public
service and to the conduct of competitive commerce and industry. Therefore,
the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the display
of signs of all types.  Also, the standards contained in this chapter are
intended to reduce distractions which may increase traffic accidents,
eliminate hazards caused by signs overhanging or projecting over public
rights-of-way, relieve traffic congestion, and encourage a more attractive
environment in which to live and do business.

§ 157.09  CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   (A)   Certificate required.  Except as provided in this section, no
construction, alteration, demolition, or removal of a designated landmark, or
a development within a Historic Preservation District shall be permitted
without a receipt of a certificate of appropriateness.  Exterior siding,
porch improvements, railings, fences, satellite dishes, and exterior lighting
which are subject to other village regulations and building code requirements
shall also require a certificate of appropriateness.



   (B)   Review.  Upon the filing of an application for a demolition
or building permit on property within a Historic Preservation District or
designated as a historic landmark, the Director of Community Development
shall notify the applicant of the need for a certificate of appropriateness,
and shall notify the Historic Preservation Commission of receipt of the
application. The application shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation
Commission considering recommendations of the Director of Community
Development and staff shall decide whether the certificate should be
approved, approved with conditions or denied.



   (C)   Standards for issuing a certificate of appropriateness.  In
considering whether to grant a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall consider the effect of the proposed
construction, alteration, removal, or demolition upon the historic, cultural,
or architectural value, character and significance of a landmark, or of a
Historic Preservation District. The standards to be used by the Commission in
making its determination shall include, but not limited to:



      (1)   Whether the project is compatible with the landmark or
historic district as a whole in terms of size, scale, and massing.  As a
guideline for alterations or new construction, the building height shall be
no greater than that of the tallest existing structure and no less than the
lowest existing structure in the same block.  The building street facade of
the proposed alterations or new construction shall be no wider or narrower
than the widest or narrowest street facade on the same block.



      (2)   The extent to which the alteration affects the
distinctive character of architectural features of the structure, including
consideration of the harmony of materials, details, height, mass, proportion,
rhythm, scale, setback, shape, street accessories, and workmanship. 
Proposed exterior materials shall be compatible in type, scale, texture, and
color with other buildings in the same block.  As a general guideline,
asbestos siding, asphalt siding, cast stone, artificial brick, aluminum,
vinyl, or masonite clapboard siding more than eight inches wide are not
acceptable materials to be used where visible from the street.



      (3)   The degree to which the proposed work would isolate the
structure from its historical or architectural surroundings.



      (4)   The compatibility of the architectural style and design
of the proposed work with the original architecture of the landmark or styles
within a historic district.



      (5)   The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with
the original design concept of the structure or with the general design
characteristics of the era which the structure represents.



      (6)   The degree to which the proposed building materials are
compatible with the aesthetic and structural appearance of the structure,
including the texture, style, and color of the materials and the proposed
combination of materials such as brick, stone, concrete, shingle, wood, and
stucco.



      (7)   The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with
additional development guidelines adopted from time to time by the Historic
Preservation Commission for landmarks or historic districts.



      (8)   The relationship of the location of the proposed work to
the streets, public or semi-public ways and any other structures or property
contiguous to a landmark or within a historic district.



      (9)   The degree to which the proposed work involves the
removal or alteration of any historic or distinctive architectural features.



      (10)     The degree to which the proposed work is compatible
with the US Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation
(codified in 36 CFR 67), as may be amended from time to time.  The following
standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a
reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical
feasibility:



         (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose
or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining
characteristics of the building and its site and environment.



         (b)   The historic character of a property shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.



         (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical
record of its time, place, and use.  Changes that create a false sense of
historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.



         (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes
that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained
and preserved.



         (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property
shall be preserved.



         (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired
rather than replaced.  Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old
design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible,
materials.  Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.



         (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. 
The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible.



         (h)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a
project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.



         (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related
new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.



         (j)   New additions and adjacent or related construction
shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the property and its environment shall be
unimpaired.



         (k)   New additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the
future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.



   (D)   Guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings.  The
following guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings are outlined in
the US Secretary of the Interior's publication, Standards for Rehabilitation
and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings ("Standards for
Rehabilitation", or "Standards"). These principles shall apply to historic
buildings of all sizes, materials, occupancy and construction types whether
designated as a landmark or part of a Historic District.  Please refer to
Standards for Rehabilitation for further details, which document is hereby
incorporated by reference into this chapter to the extent that it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or Illinois law.  The
Village Clerk shall at all times have at least three copies of the Standards
for Rehabilitation on file in his or her office for public use, and has had
said copies on file for at least 30 days prior to the adoption of this
chapter.



      (1)   As stated in the definition, the treatment
"REHABILITATION" assumes that at least some repair or alteration of the
historic building will be needed in order to provide for an efficient
contemporary use; however, these repairs and alterations must not damage or
destroy materials, features, or finishes that are important in defining the
building's historic character.  For example, certain treatments - if
improperly applied - may cause or accelerate physical deterioration of a
historic building.  This can include using improper repainting or exterior
masonry cleaning techniques, or introducing insulation that damages historic
fabric.  In almost all of these situations, use of these materials and
treatments will result in a project that does not meet the Standards. 
Similarly, exterior additions that duplicate the form, material, and
detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic
character of the structure will fail to meet the Standards.



      (2)   Identify, retain, and preserve.  The guidance that is
basic to the treatment of all historic buildings: identifying, retaining, and
preserving the form and detailing of those architectural materials and
features that are important in defining the historic character is always
recommended and encouraged.  Those actions that are most apt to cause the
diminution or even loss of the building's historic character are not
recommended and are to be discouraged.



      (3)   Protect and maintain.  After identifying those
materials and features that are important and must be retained in the process
of rehabilitation work, then protecting and maintaining them should be
addressed.  Protection generally involves the least degree of intervention
and its preparatory other work.



      (4)   Repair.  When the physical condition of
character-defining materials and features warrants additional work, repairing
is recommended.  Guidance for the repair of historic materials such as
masonry, wood, and architectural metals again begins with the least degree of
intervention methods.  Repairing also includes the limited replacement in
kind--or with a compatible substitute material--of extensively deteriorated
or missing parts of features when there are surviving prototypes.  Although
using the same kind of material is always the preferred option, substitute
material is acceptable if the form and design as well as the substitute
material itself convey the visual appearance of the remaining parts of the
feature.



      (5)   Replace.  Following repair in the hierarchy, guidance
is provided for replacing an entire character-defining feature with new
material because the level of deterioration or damage of materials precludes
repair. If the essential form and detailing are still evident so that the
physical evidence can be used to re-establish the feature as an integral part
of the rehabilitation project, then its replacement is appropriate.



      (6)   Design for missing historic features.  When an entire
interior or exterior feature is missing, it no longer plays a role in
physically defining the historic character of the building unless it can be
accurately recovered in form and detailing through the process of carefully
documenting the historical appearance.  Where an important architectural
feature is missing, its recovery is always recommended in the guidelines as
the first, or preferred, course of action.  However, a second acceptable
option for the replacement feature is a new design that is compatible with
the remaining character-defining features of the historic building.  The new
design should always take into account the size, scale, and material of the
historic building itself and, most importantly, should be clearly
differentiated so that a false historical appearance is not created.



      (7)   Alterations/additions to historic buildings.  Some
exterior and interior alterations to the historic building are generally
needed to assure its continued use, but it is most important that such
alterations do not radically change, obscure, or destroy character defining
spaces, materials, features, or finishes.  The construction of an exterior
addition to a historic building should be avoided, if possible, and
considered only after it is determined that those needs can not be met by
altering secondary, i.e., non-character defining interior spaces. If, after a
thorough evaluation of interior solutions, an exterior addition is still
judged to be the only viable alternative, it should be designed and
constructed to be clearly differentiated from the historic building and so
that the character-defining features are not radically changed, obscured,
damaged, or destroyed.



      (8)   Health and safety code requirements; energy
retrofitting.  Work done to meet health and safety code requirements (for
example, providing barrier free access to historic buildings); or
retrofitting measures to conserve energy (for example, installing solar
collectors in an unobtrusive location on the site) is quite often an
important aspect of rehabilitation projects, but it is usually not part of
the overall process of protecting or repairing character-defining features.
Rather, such work is assessed for its potential negative impact on the
building's historic character. For this reason, particular care must be taken
not to radically change, obscure, damage, or destroy character-defining
materials or features in the process of rehabilitation work to meet code and
energy requirements.



   (E)   Care and maintenance of designated property.  Any property,
real estate or improvement that is designated as a landmark, or which is
within the Historic Preservation District, whether owned or controlled
privately or publicly, shall receive reasonable care, maintenance and upkeep
appropriate for the preservation, protection, enhancement and perpetuation of
the historic, architectural and cultural atmosphere of the District.



   (F)   Action by the Historic Preservation Commission.  At the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission following
receipt of a complete application for a certificate of appropriateness and
the recommendation of the Director of Community Development and appropriate
staff, and following written notification to the owner, the Commission shall
review the application.



      (1)   If the Commission finds that the activity proposed by
the applicant:



         (a)   Will not adversely affect the significant
historical, cultural, architectural, or archaeological character or
significance of the designated landmark or Historic Preservation District or
cited in the application for landmark designation;



         (b)   Is appropriate and consistent with the criteria
established for landmark designation set forth in division (A)(4); and/or



         (c)   Will remedy conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or safety as determined by the Building Department.



      Then, the certificate of appropriateness shall be granted.



      (2)   If the Historic Preservation Commission finds the
activity proposed by the applicant does not meet the provisions included in
division (F)(1) above, and will adversely affect the historic, architectural,
archaeological, or cultural character or significance of the landmark or
Historic Preservation District, then the Commission shall recommend to the
Board of Trustees that the certificate of appropriateness be denied and so
advise the applicant and the Building Department in writing of the denial.



         (a)   Upon receipt of notice of a recommended denial of
an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the applicant may submit
evidence to the Historic Preservation Commission of any hardship from the
denial of the application that would result in substantial economic loss. 
For a landmark or landmark eligible structure:



            1.   If the Commission determines that a denial of
a certificate of appropriateness does not cause an undue economic hardship,
the Commission may recommend to the Board of Trustees to postpone the
alteration, demolition, or removal, and the Commission shall so notify the
owner in writing.  During the period set forth for postponement, the
Commission shall explore alternatives to alteration, demolition, or
removal.  Such alternatives may include consultation with private civic
groups, interested private individuals and public agencies in an effort to
find a persuasive means of preserving the structure. If the sale of the
property is considered a feasible alternative to the owner, the building must
remain on the open market for six months.  If, after a period not to exceed
six months, no alternative agreement has been reached with the applicant, the
Commission shall recommend to the Board that a certificate of appropriateness
be issued for alteration, demolition, or removal of the structure in question.



         (b)   For any structure existing in the Historic
District that is not a landmark or landmark eligible structure:



            1.   If the Historic Preservation Commission
determines that a denial of a certificate of appropriateness does not cause
an undue economic hardship, every effort should be made to reach a compromise
with the applicant that would allow approval of a certificate of
appropriateness.



      (3)   In recommending that the certificate of appropriateness
be approved, the Commission shall recommend conditions necessary to minimize
the adverse impact of the requested activity.



      (4)   The right of appeal.



         (a)   All persons shall have the right to appeal the
Historic Preservation Commission's decision pertaining to interpretation of
the codes contained in the Historic Preservation Chapter of the village. 
All appeals shall be directed to the Building Committee which is appointed by
the Board of Trustees of the village.  An application for appeal shall be
based on a claim that the true intent of this chapter or rules legally
adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted.



         (b)   The application for appeal shall be filed in
writing, addressed to the Chairman of the Building Committee, and shall
contain the following information:



            1.   Name and address of the appellant.



            2.   Location of premises or property in question.



            3.   Division, article, and section of the chapter
being contested.



            4.   Interpretation being contested.



            5.   Appellants' reasons for challenging the
Committee's interpretation stating the relief or solution requested.



            6.   Request for a hearing by the Building
Committee to review the matter.



         (c)   The Chairman shall respond to the appellant, and
shall establish a date and time for a meeting or hearing to be held within 60
days of receipt of the appeal.



         (d)   The Building Committee shall conduct an open
meeting or hearing allowing the appellant an opportunity to be heard, and
shall have the right to seek counsel from professional and technical staff
and consultants who may be called upon to offer testimony which will aid the
Committee in attempting to arrive at a just decision in the matter being
heard. The procedures shall not require compliance with strict rules of
evidence, but shall mandate that only relevant information be received.



         (e)   The Building Committee, after due deliberation,
shall render a decision in writing within 21 days of completion of the
hearing process. A simple majority vote by the Committee shall constitute the
Committee decision.



   (G)   Action by Board of Trustees.  If there is still a dispute
concerning the denial of a certificate of appropriateness and all of the
preceding options have been explored, the concerned person, group of persons,
or association may request an appeal to the Board of Trustees. In making its
decision, the Board shall consider the recommendations of the Historic
Preservation Commission, the Director of Community Development and staff, and
the criteria in division (A)(4), and grant, grant with conditions, or deny
the certificate of appropriateness.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish high standards of
landscaping and buffering for all public and private properties within the
village, promote and enhance the village's aesthetic qualities and natural
heritage, and preserve and enhance property values within the village. 
These regulations are intended to be a benefit to the owners and users of
property, as an asset of the neighborhoods, and as a source of identity and
pride to the village.  The requirements of this chapter are also intended to
promote the public health and welfare by protecting to the maximum extent
possible the village's existing landscaping and buffering and by fostering
and encouraging new or increased creative and attractive landscaping and
buffering.  It is intended that these requirements will improve the
appearance of the village, as well as assist in the natural control of air
pollution and soil conservation.  Standards for the installation, and
maintenance of bufferyards are also provided in this chapter to ensure the
compatibility of different land uses.

§ 158.02  RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE.



   (A)   All new residential developments of six units or less shall be
exempt from the provisions of this chapter.



   (B)   All new residential developments of seven units or more and
all nonresidential development shall comply with all of the standards
provided in this chapter.



   (C)   All additions, alterations, or enlargements to existing
buildings, except single-family dwellings, that exceed 50% of the value of
the existing building shall comply with all the standards set forth in this
chapter.  For the purposes of determining the applicability of these
provisions to an addition, alteration or enlargement of an existing building,
the value of the existing building shall be as indicated as the equalized
assessed value ("EAV") on the most current tax bill (the total EAV minus the
EAV of the land itself).



   (D)   Where a vacant parcel is being developed adjacent to another
vacant parcel, then the first parcel to be developed shall provide one-half
of the required bufferyard based on the most intense land use permitted on
the adjacent parcel.



   (E)   Where a vacant parcel is being developed adjacent to an
existing land use, then the developer shall provide the required bufferyard.



   (F)   Any change in land use of a property shall require the
corresponding change in bufferyard requirements.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.03  LANDSCAPING PLAN.

§ 158.04  REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF LANDSCAPING PLAN.



   (A)   Landscaping plans for single family detached residential
developments of seven units or more and all other types of development shall
be reviewed in conjunction with either site plan review and/or special use
approval (the latter if special use approval is required under the Tinley
Park Zoning Ordinance).



   (B)   The Planning Department of the village shall review the
proposed landscaping plans and shall issue a recommendation to the Plan
Commission regarding whether the proposed plan satisfies the village's
landscaping and buffering criteria.



   (C)   The Plan Commission shall review the landscaping plan and the
recommendation of the Planning Department and shall determine whether the
proposed plan meets the village's landscaping and buffering standards.



   (D)   The Plan Commission may also impose conditions on the issuance
of its approval. These conditions shall pertain to the external appearance of
the development, and may include additional landscaping, buffering, fencing
or other exterior treatment.



   (E)   The Board of Trustees may review the decision of the Plan
Commission.  If submitted in conjunction with a special use approval, the
Board shall review the Plan Commission's decision.  If submitted in
conjunction with site plan review, the applicant may appeal the Plan
Commission's decision to the Board.  The Board shall review the application
and the recommendation of the Planning Department and the decision of the
Plan Commission, and shall grant or deny the application within 30 days of
receipt of the appeal.



   (F)   No site plan or special use approval shall be granted unless a
landscaping plan is approved.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.05  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF LANDSCAPING PLANS.



   The following criteria shall be used to evaluate proposed landscaping
plans:



   (A)   Landscaping should be designed to be natural looking while
having proportion, balance, unity, variety of species, and variety of color
throughout the seasons;



   (B)   Landscaping materials that are native to the area should be
selected wherever feasible;



   (C)   As an architectural feature, landscaping should visually
soften the mass of the buildings, parking areas, and other structures;



   (D)   Landscaping should provide massings of natural colors and
shapes to offset the mass of a building and to provide a visual relief to the
straight lines of building architecture, parking lots and other man made
features.



   (E)   Landscaping should reduce the intrusion of headlights and
other glare;



   (F)   Landscaping should provide a safety barrier between vehicles
and pedestrians;



   (G)   Landscaping should offer a visual separation or screen between
land uses that have intense activities or significantly different
appearances, or that are otherwise incompatible to some degree;



   (H)   Landscaping should shade seating, walking, and outdoor
activity areas, shield buildings from winter wind and summer sun so as to
conserve energy, and should not interfere with clear access to the sun where
solar energy collection is anticipated;



   (I)   Landscaping should be designed to trap noise, odor and dust,
control erosion, and allow groundwater recharge;



   (J)   Landscaping should provide a natural habitat for birds and
other animal life, and should preserve existing natural vegetation and other
natural features of a site so as to enhance overall site design and protect
animal populations and other ecological systems;



   (K)   Landscaping should be innovative and creative, and should
ensure the proper long-term maintenance and replacement of landscaping as
needed; and



   (1)   The best professional practices of the American Society of
Landscape Architects regarding planting, installation, and other maintenance
should be followed.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.06  TIME FOR INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   All landscaping, including mulching and seeding, shall be
completed in accordance with the approved site plan or special use approval
prior to issuance of an occupancy permit for the site.  This shall apply to
all types of developments, except single family detached residential
developments of less than seven units.



   (B)   The village may issue a temporary occupancy permit until the
earliest planting season if landscaping is delayed due to unusual conditions,
such as drought, ice, over-saturated soil (deep mud), or inappropriate
planting season for the plant species, unavailability of plant species, or
other circumstances beyond the applicant's control, provided that the
developer or property owner provides the village with a letter of credit
approved by the Village Attorney ensuring the installation of the remaining
landscape materials.



   (C)   All landscaping for single family residential developments of
seven units or more shall be completed in accordance with the approved site
plan at the time that 80% of the development is completed or within the next
planting season following occupancy, whichever comes first.  If the
development is built in phases, than the landscaping shall be completed as
80% of each phase is completed or within the next planting season following
occupancy, whichever comes first.  The developer or property owner shall
provide the village with a letter of credit approved by the Village Attorney
ensuring the installation of the landscape materials. The developer or
property owner shall be notified by the Planning Department of any incomplete
landscape installation and shall be given 15 days to respond to the notice.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.07  VEGETATED BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Bufferyards shall be required to provide open space and
natural barriers around the perimeter of a proposed land use in order to
separate and screen the proposed use from adjacent development, vacant land,
or roads.



   (B)   Bufferyard requirements supplement the minimum setbacks
required in a given zoning district by imposing vegetation protection,
landscaping and fencing or screening requirements. The width, amount of
vegetation and other features of a bufferyard will vary depending on the
nature of adjacent development, vacant land, or road.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.08  LOCATION OF BUFFERYARD.



   The buffers required by this chapter shall be located along the entire
perimeter of a lot or parcel, except at approved entrances or exits to the
property or in required sight triangles. Bufferyards shall extend to the lot
line, parcel boundary line or right of way line, except where easements,
covenants or natural features may require the bufferyard to be set back from
the property line.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.09  REQUIRED BUFFERYARD FOR SPECIAL USES PROPOSED IN RESIDENTIAL
DISTRICTS.



   Any special use proposed in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 districts shall
be separated from any residential lot by a Class C bufferyard.  Refer to
Appendix A for all other bufferyard requirements.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.10 REQUIRED BUFFERYARD FOR ANY USES PROPOSED IN A NONRESIDENTIAL
DISTRICT.



   The class of the bufferyard required between a proposed land use in any
nonresidential district and an adjacent land use shall be determined by
referring to Appendix A of this chapter for the appropriate type of zoning
district.  The required bufferyard is determined by cross-referencing the
"proposed land use" with the appropriate "adjacent land use."  If a proposed
land use is not shown on the chart, the Village Staff shall determine the
appropriate bufferyard.  Any decision by the Village Staff may be appealed
to the Plan Commission.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.11  REDUCED BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS FOR IRREGULARLY SHAPED PARCELS.



   When a parcel contains a "panhandle" or other narrow shape, the
bufferyard requirements may be reduced along the irregular portion of the
parcel perimeter.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.12  BUFFERYARD SPECIFICATIONS.



   (A)   The bufferyard illustrations, which follow graphically,
indicate the width and number of plants required per 100 linear feet.  To
determine the total number of plants required, the length of each side of the
property requiring a given class of buffer shall be divided by 100 and
multiplied by the number of plants shown in any of the options in the
illustration.



Any buffer area, which overlaps another buffer area, shall be subtracted from
the total to avoid double counting.  If the calculations required by this
section yield a fractional number, that number shall be rounded up to the
next highest whole number.



   (B)   The developer or owner of the property shall determine the
arrangement of plants in the bufferyard.



   (C)   Existing trees and vegetation within a required buffer, which
meet these requirements may be counted toward the total bufferyard plant
material requirements.  If existing trees and plants do not fully meet the
standards for the type of buffer required, additional vegetation shall be
planted.  Other existing site features within the required buffer area which
do not otherwise function to meet the standards for the required buffer shall
be screened from the view of other properties or removed, as determined
during review and approval of the site plan or major special use.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.13  FENCES, WALLS, BERMS AND HEDGES.



   Fences, walls, berms and/or hedges may be required to supplement
required plant materials if the Department of Community Development
determines that additional screening is necessary to shield a proposed land
use from adjacent uses.  Fences, walls or berms may be used to replace
one-half of the required plantings in bufferyards D or E with the approval of
the Planning Department.  If required, fences, walls, berms or hedges shall
be constructed in accordance with the following specifications:



   (A)   Fences, walls and solid hedgerows shall be not less than five
feet in height nor more than six feet in height in residential areas and
eight feet in height in nonresidential areas around the perimeter of the
property.



   (B)   Fences and walls for residential developments over seven units
and all nonresidential development shall be made of natural materials, such
as wooden picket fences, wood stockade fences or brick or masonry walls.



   (C)   Hedges shall consist of densely planted compact evergreens.



   (D)   Earthen berms shall not be less than three feet in height and
shall be covered with grass or other living vegetative ground cover.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.14  USE OF BUFFERYARDS.



   A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation or for utility or
drainage easements, provided that the utility requirements and the bufferyard
requirements are compatible.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.15 OWNERSHIP OF BUFFERYARDS.



   Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of the owner of the lot, or
they may be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently conveyed to a
homeowners' association, provided that any such conveyance adequately
guarantees the protection and maintenance of the bufferyards for the purposes
of this chapter.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.16  NO DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE REQUIRED BUFFER.



   The required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious
surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this
chapter.  No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur
within the buffer unless approved by the Plan Commission at the time of site
plan, if required, or special use approval, if required.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)

(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.18 INTERIOR LOT LANDSCAPING.



   Except for parking lot interiors provided for in § 158.20 below, the
following interior lot landscaping standards apply to single family detached
residential developments of seven or more units, and to all other types of
multi-family and nonresidential development:



   (A)   Areas of the lot not covered by structures or pavement shall
be planted with live landscaping.



   (B)   Decorative stone, brick, or pavement may be used for edging
planting beds but may not cover more than 20% of the landscaped area.



   (C)   Live species shall be planted along the front and sidewalls of
non-residential buildings and along the rear walls of non-residential
buildings wherever feasible.



   (D)   Shade trees should be located on the south side of buildings
wherever feasible to block summer sun.



   (E)   Plantings shall be clustered along long walls and fences to
soften the visual effect of the horizontal lines.



   (F)   Building foundations shall be landscaped to provide massings
of natural colors and shapes to offset the mass of the building and to
provide visual relief to the straight lines of building architecture, parking
lots and other man-made features.



   (G)   The precise location of all plantings shall be shown on the
landscaping plan.  The plantings shall be far enough away from the
foundation and pavement to allow roots to spread and mature growth to
occur.  Plantings may be clustered along the building wall.



   (H)   Only small trees, small shrubs and flowers may be planted in
raised containers.



   (I)   Courtyards, berms and other landscaping features may be

interior access lanes.



   (K)   A minimum of one tree is required per dwelling for
multi-family residential development, one tree per 10,000 square feet of lot
area for commercia1/office development, and one tree per 25,000 square feet

(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.19  PARKWAY STANDARDS.



   All uses which require site plan or special use approval shall install
and maintain trees along any parkway which abuts the perimeter of the
property.



   (A)   The parkway shall be grass or low ground cover, except where
covered by driveway pavement, trees, or shrubs or a strip of paver bricks, or
stones (six inches or more in diameter) set in mortar, that strip being two
feet wide or less and being located along the curb.  This applies to all
zoning districts except the following: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7.



   (B)   A minimum of one parkway tree per 50 feet of frontage is
required for all development; provided, however, a minimum of one parkway
tree per 25 feet of frontage is required for all non-residential development
in the B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and B-5 Districts and also in the ORI Office and
Restricted Industrial District and M-1 General Manufacturing District under
the Tinley Park Zoning Ordinance.



   (C)   The use of loose stone, rock, or gravel is prohibited on
public parkways.  Compacted cobbles, flagstone, or other rocks may be
approved if these features are compacted firmly into the ground or mortared,
reducing risk of being scattered in the street.



   (D)   Trees shall be planted on the centerline of parkways or as
close to five feet from the sidewalk as possible and located so as not to
interfere with overhead wires or traffic or pedestrian safety.



   (E)   A minimum parkway width of four feet is required for trees in
a parkway.



   (F)   Wherever feasible, parkway trees shall be planted on the
public parkway and not on the private property side of the sidewalk.



   (G)   Parkway trees shall consist of shorter trees if overhead
utilities exist or if the street is subject to widening in the future. 
Otherwise, taller trees are required as shown in the following list.  A
mixture of trees shall be planted whenever feasible.



(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)



§ 158.20 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.

material at maturity shall allow for a three foot bumper overhang from the
face of the curb.



      (5)   All sidewalks shall be at least ten feet from the trunks
of large trees, unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer where the

accommodate both the tree and the sidewalk.



      (6)   Curbs shall be provided between vehicular use areas and
landscaped areas.



      (7)   Parking lots shall be graded so that landscape islands

on-site retention of stormwater.



      (8)   Groves of trees, as well as isolated islands with single
trees, are encouraged.



      (9)   At least 15% of the parking lot shall be covered by
landscaping, that 15% being exclusive of required bufferyards and foundation
planting areas.



   (B)   Parking Lot Island Standards.



      (1)   Each island shall be at least 200 square feet and at
least ten feet wide.  Larger islands are encouraged, however, especially

Standards for Nursery Stock, published by the American Association of
Nurserymen for that type of tree or shrub at the time of installation.



      (3)   All plant material shall be installed free of disease
and in a manner that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water to
sustain healthy growth.



      (4)   All plant material shall be planted with a minimum of
six inches of organic soil and mulched to a depth of three inches.



      (5)   All plant material shall be planted in a manner which is
not intrusive to utilities or pavement.



      (6)   All earth berm locations shall be reviewed by the
Village Engineer to determine how the berms shall relate to drainage and
public utilities.



   (D)   Maintenance Standards.



      (1)   The plantings in any landscaped area must be properly
maintained in order for the landscaped area to fulfill the purposes for which
it was established.  The owner of the property and any tenant on the
property where a landscaped area is required shall be jointly and severally
responsible for the maintenance of all plant material within the landscaped
area.  Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the
landscaped areas free of litter and debris and to keep plantings healthy and
orderly in appearance.



      (2)   All landscape materials required by this chapter in any
business or commercial, industrial and/or office developments shall be
installed in accordance with the standard practices of horticultural
professionals and in good and workmanlike manner and shall be maintained by
the property owner in good condition.  All applicants for landscape plan
approval shall file a maintenance schedule and the scope of maintenance work
with the Planning Director and the Code Enforcement Officer.  Such
maintenance schedule shall be subject to the approval of the village.  Any
damaged or dead trees, shrubs or ground cover shall be replaced promptly. 
Maintenance of landscaped areas shall include continuous operations for
removal of weeds; mowing; trimming; edging; cultivation; reseeding; plant
replacement; appropriate fertilization; spraying; control of pests, insects
and rodents by non-toxic methods wherever possible; watering; and any other
operations necessary to assure normal plant growth and good health. The
obligation for continuous maintenance shall be binding on the applicant for
landscape plan approval, on any subsequent owners of the property, and on any
other parties having a controlling interest in the property and/or tenants
residing thereon.



      (3)   A letter of credit shall be provided to the village by
the owner or developer prior to the issuance of a building permit.



      (4)   The adjacent property owner shall maintain a parkway
unless an agreement for maintenance has been reached with the village.



      (5)   The plantings, fences, walls or berms that constitute a
buffer must be properly maintained in order for the buffer to fulfill the
purpose for which it is established.  The owner of the property and any
tenant on the property where a buffer is required shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the maintenance of all buffer materials. Such
maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffer free of
litter and debris, to keep walls, fences, and berms in good repair and neat
appearance.  All buffer materials shall be protected from damage by motor
vehicles or pedestrians, which could reduce the effectiveness of the buffer.



      (6)   In the event that any vegetation or physical element
functioning to meet the standards of this section is severely damaged due to
an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, the owner shall have
one year or one growing season, whichever is sooner, to replace or replant.

SECTION III
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Except as hereinafter specifically provided, the following general regulations shall apply:
A. INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION
In interpreting and applying these regulations, the requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum requirements necessary to carry out the purpose of these regulations. Except as hereinafter provided, these regulations shall not be deemed to interfere with, abrogate, annul, or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever, any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties. Whenever the provisions of these regulations impose greater restrictions upon the use of land or buildings, or upon the height of buildings, or require a larger percentage of lot to be left unoccupied than the provisions of other ordinances, rules, regulations, permits, or any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, the provisions of these regulations shall govern.
B. USE OF LAND OR STRUCTURES
The provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to all properties as hereinafter specifically provided:
1. New and Existing Uses. No building or structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or altered, except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located;
2. Nonconforming Uses. Any lawful building, structure, or use existing at the time of the enactment of the Zoning Ordinance may be continued, even though such building, structure, or use does not conform to the provisions herein for the district in which it is located, and whenever a district shall be changed hereafter, the then existing lawful use may be continued, subject to the provisions of Section VI;
3. Lot of Record. A Lot of Record at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance which is unable to meet the requirements of this Ordinance as to area and lot width may be used, provided it shall meet all the other requirements of this Ordinance. However, when two (2) or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate area and dimensions to qualify for a Permitted Use under the requirements of the use district in which they are located, are contiguous and are held in one ownership, at the time of or subsequent to the adoption of this amendment, they shall be used as one zoning lot for such use; and
Section III  Page 2
4. Construction in Process. Where construction of a building or structure has begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and is being diligently prosecuted to completion, said building or structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the Building Permit was issued, and further may, upon completion, be occupied under a Certificate of Occupancy subject to the provisions herein set forth in the section pertaining to nonconforming structures and uses.
C. HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
1. No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered to exceed the height limit hereinafter established for the district in which the building is located, except that penthouses or roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or similar equipment required to operate and maintain the building and fire or parapet walls, skylights, towers, steeples, stage lofts and screens, flagpoles, chimneys, smokestacks, individual domestic radio, television aerials and wireless masts, water tanks, or similar structures may be erected above the height limits when recommended by the Zoning Board of Appeals and approved by the Village Board. No such structure may be erected to exceed by more than fifteen (15) feet the height limits of the District in which it is located; nor shall such structure have a total area greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the roof area of the building; nor shall such structure be used for any residential purpose or any commercial or industrial purpose other than a use incidental to the main use of the building. Provided, however, that all buildings in the Zoning Districts established by the 2011 Legacy Code (being the Downtown Core District, Downtown Flex District, Downtown General District, Neighborhood General District, Neighborhood Flex District, and Civic District) are governed by the height provisions of said Legacy Code and are, therefore, exempt from the height limitations set forth in this Section III.C.1.
2. Hospitals, institutions, schools, or public utility and service buildings, when permitted in a district, may be erected to a height not exceeding sixty (60) feet, provided said specified buildings shall be set back from the front, rear, and side lot lines on the ratio of two (2) feet for every one (1) foot of building height greater than forty (40) feet; provided, however, that said specified requirements shall apply in addition to the other requirements for building line setbacks and for rear and side yards specifically set forth in this Ordinance. Provided, however, that all buildings in the zoning districts established by the 2011 Legacy Code (being the Downtown Core District, Downtown Flex District, Downtown General District, Neighborhood General District, Neighborhood Flex District, and Civic District) are governed by the height provisions of said Legacy Code and are therefore exempt from the height limitations set forth in this Section III.C.2.
3. Planned Unit Developments may exceed the height limits established for the district in which the structure is located, provided that the height conforms with the standards and requirements set forth in Section VII.C.2.O of this Ordinance.
Section III  Page 3
D. LOTS
1. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a lot as herein defined, and in no case shall there be more than one principal building on a lot except in a Planned Unit Development, or as otherwise provided in this Ordinance.
2. No lot shall hereafter be divided in order to secure one or more additional lots for transfer of ownership or establishment of a principal use thereon, unless each lot, resulting from such division, shall have the minimum lot area and lot width as required in this Ordinance for the district in which the lot is located.
3. Where two (2) or more permitted or Special Uses, each requiring a minimum lot area, are provided in the same building or on the same lot, the required lot area shall be the sum of the areas required for each use individually.
4. Every dwelling shall be constructed or erected upon a lot or parcel of land which has at least twenty (20) feet of frontage abutting upon a public street.
5. Where unique land planning designs are employed in a subdivision or a Planned Unit Development to conserve the natural character of the land or to create a functional or compatible arrangement of structures or uses, a lot which does not abut upon a public or private street may be permitted provided that:
a. Adequate provision is made for free access to the lot for the property owner, or in the case of a non-residential lot, for those persons who would normally require access to the lot;
b. Adequate provision is made for the unobstructed access of firefighting equipment, police protection, rubbish collection, and other governmental services;
c. Adequate provision is made for the extension and maintenance of public and private utility services; and
d. The arrangement will not contribute toward congestion in nearby streets as a result of delivery services, lack of guest parking, or other reasons.
6. The maintenance of yards, courts, and other open spaces and minimum lot area legally required for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building or of the property on which it is located, as long as the building is in existence.
E. YARDS
1. All yards and other open spaces, as required by this Ordinance, shall be located on the same lot as the principal structure or use. No legally required yards, open space, or lot
areas for any use or structure shall be used to satisfy yard, open space, or lot area requirements for any other structure or use.
Section III  Page 4
2. On a corner lot, the front lot line shall be the lot line having the shortest dimension along the street right-of-way line. The required front yard setback on corner lots shall apply to each side of the lot facing a street.
3. On vacant through lots, the front lot line shall be along the street line designated by the Building Inspector except that when a front line has been established on one or more lots in the same block and all have front lot lines established along the same street line, the street line designated as the front lot line for such lot or lots shall be the front lot line on all vacant through lots in such block. On through lots, only those obstructions permitted in this Ordinance in front yards shall be located in that part of a rear yard adjoining a street that is equivalent in depth to a required front yard; however, where a no-access strip has been provided for such lots on a recorded plat, the Zoning Administrator may waive such requirements if, in his judgment, an exception to this requirement would be appropriate.
4. No yards allocated to a structure or use existing on the effective date of this Ordinance shall be subsequently reduced or further reduced below the yard requirements of this Ordinance, except a yard adjoining a street may be reduced in depth in the event and to the extent the right-of-way width of such street adjoining such yard is subsequently increased.
5. Where fifty (50) percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have observed (within a variation of five (5) feet or less) a front yard greater in depth than required herein, new buildings shall not be erected closer to the street than the average front yard so established by the existing buildings. Provided, however, that all building in the zoning districts established by the 2011 Legacy Code (being the Downtown Core District, Downtown Flex District, Downtown General District, Neighborhood General District, Neighborhood Flex District, and Civic District) are governed by the front yard/frontage provisions of said Legacy Code and are, therefore, exempt from the frontage/front yard requirements set forth in this Section III.E.5.
F. REQUIRED SETBACKS
Setback lines shall be maintained on all lots abutting streets and thoroughfares. The minimum setback on lots abutting a street or thoroughfare shall be the distance required for a front yard or side yard, adjoining a street, in the district where such lots are located, measured from the existing right-of-way line of the street or thoroughfare, or from the proposed right-of-way line as designated on the Official Map, and as duly established by other Ordinances or as established by county or state highway authorities, whichever has the greatest right-of-way width requirements.
Except for incidental uses, no structure shall be constructed on a dedicated public or private utility easement, nor shall any structure be constructed so as to encroach upon any easement.
Section III  Page 5
G. VISIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  CORNER LOTS
No structure, wall, fence, shrubbery, or trees shall be erected, maintained, or planted on any lot which will obstruct the view of the driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection, excepting that shrubbery and low retaining walls not exceeding two (2) feet in height above the curb level and shade trees where all branches are not less than eight (8) feet above the street level will be permitted. For residential corner lots, this unobstructed area shall be a triangular section of land formed by the two street right-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points thirty (30) feet from the intersection of said right-of-way.

Under any circumstances, personal wireless facilities shall not exceed the following height restrictions unless otherwise specifically approved by grant of a Special Use Permit as per Section X.J hereof:
a. The maximum height of a freestanding tower shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet provided; however, that an applicant requesting a freestanding tower shall demonstrate that the tower antenna is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily;
b. If mounted on the roof of an existing building or structure, the height of an antenna shall not exceed ten (10) feet above the height of the existing structure provided; however, that the maximum height may be increased if: (1) the radio signal would be impaired or blocked off if the antenna was located near the middle of the roof; and (2) the Village Board determines that it is preferable to locate the antenna at a location other than near the edge of the roof; and
c. An antenna attached to the side of a building, structure, or tower shall not extend above the roof of the building, structure, or tower; provided, however, if the radio
Section III  Page 36
signal is distorted or blocked by structures located on the roof of the building, the Village may allow the height to exceed the height of the building, structure or tower in its discretion.
3. Screening and Site Location for Personal Wireless Service Facilities Attached to
Freestanding Towers:
a. Support structures and antennas shall have a non-contrasting blue, gray, or similar color that minimizes their visibility and is compatible with the surrounding landscape;
b. Personal wireless service facilities should be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical; and
c. Personal wireless service facilities attached to a freestanding tower shall not be located between a principal building and a street or in the front yard of the lot in question. Such freestanding tower shall be located adjacent to the rear wall of the principal building unless: (1) it is shown that an alternate location results in more effective screening or blending of the tower into the surrounding landscape; or (2) the location has the effect of interfering with the operations of the principal use on the subject property; provided, however, such personal wireless service facilities nevertheless may not be located between the principal building and the street or in the front yard of the lot in question.
4. Screening and Site Location for Personal Wireless Service Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings or Structures:
a. Personal wireless service facilities may be attached to the wall or roof of a building subject to height restrictions in this Subsection therein.

Said Building Permit shall verify that towers and antennas are constructed in compliance with applicable Village Building Codes and any requirements of the Electronic Industries Standards and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as the provisions herein.
7. Co-Location and Location on Existing Structures Preferred:
In order to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one provider on existing or new towers and location of antennas on existing buildings or structures shall take precedence over the construction of new freestanding towers. If a new, freestanding tower is proposed, Special Use Approval shall not be granted unless the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following:
a. A diligent effort has been made to locate the antenna on an existing structure and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints and economic or technological feasibility, no other appropriate location is available;
Section III  Page 38
b. Covenants shall be recorded which require that the applicant allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other providers of personal wireless service facilities and other antennas to co-locate on the proposed freestanding tower, where such co-location is technologically feasible; and
c. The Site Plan for the construction of a new, freestanding tower shall delineate an area, either on site or on adjacent property, near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of additional equipment and buildings for other users. To the extent that the site for the new freestanding tower is adequate to allow co-location on such site, the applicant must allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other providers to locate on site.
8. Abandonment of Towers or Antennas:
In the event the use of a tower or antenna is discontinued for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the tower or antenna shall be deemed to be abandoned. The Community Development Director shall determine the date of abandonment based on documentation required from the tower owner/operator or other appropriate sources. Upon abandonment, the tower owner/operator shall have an additional sixty (60) days within which to:
a. Reactivate the use of the tower either by said owner/operator or transfer of the tower to another owner/operator for such use within the aforesaid sixty (60) day period. Transfer of the tower to another owner/operator shall not require Special Use Approval provided use of the tower is re-activated within the sixty (60) day period, and that the use of the tower complies with all conditions of the original Special Use Approval and the terms of this Ordinance;
b. Dismantle and remove the tower at which time any Special Use shall become null and void; and
c. Request approval from the Board of Trustees to allow the abandoned tower or antenna to remain for a specified period of time. If said approval is granted, the tower shall be reactivated or removed within the time period approved by the Board of Trustees as per regulations herein.

Section IV − Page 2
SECTION V
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
A. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICTS
1. Residential Districts: The R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts are intended to stabilize, preserve, and protect certain older areas of the community developed principally for single-family uses, and to provide new areas in which exclusively single-family detached dwellings may be constructed.
The R-5 Low Density Residential District is intended to provide an environment of predominantly low density single-family dwelling units, including two-family and townhouses in which individual units are privately owned.
The R-6 Medium Density Residential District is intended to provide for a compatible co-mingling of single-family, two-family, and multiple-family dwellings. Garden apartments and larger multiple-family structures with corresponding proportions of open space may also be developed under prescribed standards of density and open space. In addition to large areas allocated for this district, it has useful application as a buffer or transitional zone along highways, major streets, and bordering shopping centers.
The R-7 High Density Residential District is intended to be used only in areas having close proximity to rail service, major shopping facilities, and within Planned Unit Developments providing such amenities that would, in the judgment of the Plan Commission and the Village Board, justify the higher density.
2. Business Districts: The B-1 Neighborhood Shopping District is intended to provide areas for retail and service establishments to supply convenience goods or personal services for the daily needs of the residents living in adjacent residential neighborhoods. The district is designed to encourage shopping centers with planned off-street parking and loading and to provide for existing individual or small groups of local stores.
The B-2 Community Shopping District is intended to provide for a wide variety of related retail-type businesses along with personal uses and other complementary uses. The permitted uses would serve not only nearby residential areas, but also people in neighboring communities and transients for goods and services usually found in larger shopping centers. Comparison shopping is to be emphasized and highway-oriented uses are to be discouraged.
The B-3 General Business and Commercial District is designed to accommodate a wide range of specialized commercial uses, including highway-oriented services and commercial types of establishments to serve the needs of motorists. This district is intended to include those uses which would not be compatible in a neighborhood or community-type shopping center.
Section V – Page 1
The B-4 Office and Service Business District is intended to provide areas used primarily to provide office space for service-type businesses. Certain commercial uses, which conform to the pattern of the district and are compatible with the types of services provided, are also permitted. This district is normally small in size and is intended to serve as a buffer or transition between residential and commercial areas.
The B-5 Automotive Service District is intended to provide certain areas for automotive service and related types of uses. The district is intended to be located along major thoroughfares where adequately sized and properly located parcels of land will allow for adequate setbacks, clear vision, and safe ingress and egress.
3. Industrial Districts: The ORI Office and Restricted Industrial District is intended to provide land for medium to large office buildings, research activities, and non-objectionable industrial activities which are attractively landscaped and designed to create a “park-like” setting. The low intensity and limiting restrictions are intended to provide for permitted uses which will be compatible with adjacent residential and commercial developments.
The M-1 General Manufacturing District is intended to provide for those industrial activities that have moderate environmental effects and are located in areas relatively removed from residential and prime retail development.
4. Overlay Districts: The MU-1 Mixed-Use Duvan Drive Overlay District is intended to provide for business and light industrial uses in the Duvan Drive Business Park along with some automobile-related uses compatible with the area.
The UD-1 Urban Design Overlay District is intended to promote specific design standards concerned with the character and placement of non-residential buildings, including related parking and other accessory uses, as well as the role and nature of the spaces between buildings and the public streets.

9. Performance Standards: Any use established in the ORI and M-1 Districts, after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall be so operated as to comply with the Performance Standards governing: (a) noise; (b) vibration; (c) air pollution; (d) fire and explosion hazards; and (e) glare–as set forth hereinafter.
Uses in ORI Office and Restricted Industrial District shall be governed by the Category A Performance Standards described below, and uses in the M-1 General Manufacturing District shall be governed by the Category B Standards. Uses in the commercial and business districts shall be governed by Category B Standards with regard to glare. Uses already established on the effective date of this Ordinance shall be permitted to be altered, enlarged, expanded or modified, provided that the additions or changes comply with said Performance Standards.
A. Noise
For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, noise shall be measured with a sound level meter and impact noise analyzer, meeting the applicable standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI S1.4-1971 and ANSI S1.11-1966). The instrument shall be set to the A-weighted response and the meter to the slow response.
1) Maximum Permitted Sound Levels: The following table specifies the noise limits that apply on or beyond adjacent lot lines or zone boundaries outside the user’s property. Noises shall not exceed the maximum sound levels specified in the table, except as designated below. Where more than one specified sound level applies, the most restrictive shall govern. Measurements may be made at points of maximum noise intensity.
Category
Maximum Permitted Sound Levels Section V – Page 29
A
65 dBA at Lot Line
B
65 dBA at Zone Boundary
In any residential zone, the weighted sound level shall not exceed 55 dBA during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and shall not exceed 45 dBA during the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.; however, these levels may be exceeded by 10 dBA for a single period no longer than fifteen (15) minutes in any one day.
For impact noise levels, the maximum sound levels described above, increased by 20 dB, shall apply. For purposes of this Ordinance, impact noise shall be considered to be those noises whose peak values, as measured on the impact noise analyzer are more than 6dB higher than the values indicated on the sound level meter.
Noises not under the direct control of an industrial operation (such as motor vehicles, excavation equipment, or other independent transportation facilities) are excluded from the above limitations.
B. Vibration
No activity or operation shall cause or create earth borne vibrations in excess of the displacement values given below. Ground-transmitted vibrations shall be measured with a seismograph or complement of instructions capable of recording vibration displacement, particle velocity, or acceleration and frequency simultaneously in three mutually perpendicular directions. Measurements may be made at points of maximum vibration intensity.
1) Vibration Level Restrictions: The maximum peak permitted particle velocities, measured at the adjacent lot line or any point along a residential district boundary line, shall not exceed the following:
Category
Maximum Peak Particle Velocity
(in/sec*)

during the hours 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and shall not exceed 0.01 inches per second
during the hours 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The maximum particle velocity shall be the
maximum vector sum of three mutually perpendicular components recorded
simultaneously. Particle velocity may also be expressed as 6.28 times the displacement
in inches multiplied by frequency in cycles per second.
For the purpose of this Ordinance, steady state vibrations are vibrations which are continuous, or vibrations in discrete impulses more frequent than sixty (60) per minute. Discrete impulses which do not exceed sixty (60) per minute shall be Section V – Page 30
considered impact vibrations. Impact vibrations shall be limited to values no more than twice as high as those specified for the maximum peak particle velocities permitted above.

A. No improvements shall be constructed, erected, placed, altered, maintained, or permitted on any building site until plans and specifications of the proposed improvements have been approved by the Industrial and Commercial Commission of the Village of Tinley Park. Such plans and specifications shall be drawn to scale and shall show, among other things: plot layout and all exterior elevations; materials and colors; signs and landscaping; number and size of parking spaces; driveways; grading, easements, and utilities; proposed building use; number of employees (approximately); and such other information as may be requested by said Commission.
B. All buildings and improvements shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
Section V – Page 35
1. No building or structure shall be erected nearer than fifty (50) feet to any existing street right-of-way, or nearer than twenty-five (25) feet to the side property lines of any building site;
2. Building construction and design shall be used to create a structure with four (4) equally attractive sides of high quality, rather than place all emphasis on the front elevation of the building while neglecting or down grading the aesthetic appeal of the side and rear elevations of the building;

Parking areas and access drives and loading areas shall be paved with an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete and shall be graded to assure proper drainage. No parking shall be permitted within ten (10) feet of the right-of-way line of any street, and no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the area between the front setback line and the street right-of-way line shall be used for parking areas and access drives.
7. Every site on which a building or structure is placed shall be landscaped according to plans approved in writing by the Industrial and Commercial Commission. Such landscaping plan shall include information regarding other customary landscape treatment for the entire site. Further, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of the building site to landscape and maintain the area between the lot lines and the street pavement adjacent to the owner’s building site. Landscaping shall be installed within sixty (60) days of the completion of construction or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit.
8. The Industrial and Commercial Commission shall base its recommended approval (or disapproval) on compliance with the standards of the Tinley Park Zoning Ordinance and such other things as: the adequacy of site dimensions; the effect of the proposed location and use on the development or maintenance of improvements on neighboring sites; the proposed operations and uses; the effect upon neighboring sites of the topography, grade and finished ground elevations proposed for the site; coordination of landscaping within the site or with neighboring sites; and the facing of the main elevation with respect to nearby streets, the extent to which the design of Section V – Page 36
all proposed elevations is integrated.
11. Temporary Uses: Upon application to the Building and Planning Department’s review and recommendation by the Zoning Administrator and issuance of a permit therefore, the following uses may be operated as temporary uses:
A. Temporary building of yard for construction materials and/or equipment, both incidental and necessary to construction in the Zoning District: Each permit shall specify the location of the building or yard and the area of permitted operation. Each such permit shall be valid for a period of not more than six (6) calendar months and shall not be renewed for more than five (5) successive periods at the same location.
B. Temporary office, both incidental and necessary for the sale or rental of real property: Each permit shall specify the location of the office and the area of permitted operation.

Section V – Page 37
G. Parking Lot designated for a special event; provided, however, that each permit shall be valid only for the duration of the designated special event.
12. Adult Regulated Uses: In the development and execution of this Ordinance, it is recognized that there are some adult uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas.
Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this Section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area (i.e. not more than two such uses within one thousand (1,000) feet of each other which would create such adverse effects). Uses subject to these controls are as follows: Adult Book Store; Adult Motion Picture Theater; Adult Mini Motion Picture Theater; and Adult Entertainment Cabaret.
A. The President and Board of Trustees may waive this locational provision if the following findings are made:
(1) That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this Ordinance will be observed;
(2) That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a “skid row” area;
(3) That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation nor will it interfere with any program of urban renewal; and
(4) That all applicable regulations of this Ordinance will be observed.
B. It shall be unlawful to hereafter establish any Adult Book Store, Adult Motion Picture Theater, Adult Mini Motion Picture Theater, or Adult Entertainment Cabaret within one thousand (1,000) feet of any area zoned for residential use or use by churches or schools. This prohibition may be waived if the person applying for the waiver shall file with the Zoning Board of Appeals a petition which indicates approval of the proposed regulated use by sixty (60) percent of the persons owning, residing or doing business within a radius of one thousand (1,000) feet of the location of the proposed use, the Petitioner shall attempt to contact all eligible locations within this radius, and must maintain a list of all addresses at which no contact was made.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall adopt rules and regulations governing the procedure for securing the petition of consent provided for in this section of the Ordinance. The rules shall provide that the circulator of the petition requesting a waiver shall subscribe to an affidavit attesting to the fact that the circulator personally witnessed the signatures on the petition and that the same were affixed to the petition by the person whose name appeared thereon.
Section V – Page 38
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not consider the waiver of location requirements set forth in this Section until the above described petition shall have been filed and verified.
D. In the application of the provisions of the Adult Regulated Uses, the following definitions shall apply:
1. “Specified Anatomical Areas” shall include:
a) Those that are less than completely and opaquely covered, including human genitals (pubic region), buttocks, and female breasts below a point immediately above the top of the areola; and
b) Human male genitals in a discernible turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered.
2. “Specified Sexual Activities” shall include:
a) Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal;
b) Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse, or sodomy; and
c) Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttocks, or female breasts.

Thrift stores or resale shops
(4) Applicability:
Unless otherwise noted, the regulations of this Overlay District will apply to all properties located within the District boundaries.
B. Signage:
(1) Intent:
a. It is intent of this ordinance to differentiate the needs of signage for this unique tourism, shopping, and entertainment area, which may require larger wayfinding signage, larger commercial signage, and special allowances for variable electronic message center signs than permitted in the remainder of the community due to unique economic and taxation challenges within Rich Township. The unique needs of this district, that create a differentiation from the rest of the Village serve as the reasons for establishing the boundaries of the district, include:
Section V – Page 49
i. Interstate highway-orientation of this district;
ii. Desire of the Village to promote the tourism and entertainment aspects of the district;
iii. Greater wayfinding needs for entertainment/tourism-based districts;
iv. Coordination amongst district businesses to promote this district as a particular node of unique commercial activity;
v. Significant traffic counts expected for concerts, special events, and certain shopping seasons; and
vi. The unique economic development and redevelopment needs of the district within Rich Township, Cook County.
An existing non-conforming sign, once used for the amphitheater, exists along I-80 that is currently not used. The Village finds that it is in its best interest to consider an adaptive reuse of the sign with appropriate regulations.
b. It is also the specific intent of the signage within this district to serve only the licensed businesses and special events that are physically located within the District and to serve the needs of the tourists within the Rich Township Entertainment and Tourism District.
c. It is not the intent of the signage within this district to create off-site signage opportunities or billboard-oriented signage within the community.
(2) Regulations:
a. District Freestanding Entrance Sign
i. One (1) freestanding sign with a total height of no more than 80 feet (measured from the adjacent grade) will be allowed for the purposes of serving the entire District with interstate-oriented signage. This sign shall be placed on one single property that is immediately adjacent to the I-80 Interstate and must be located within the boundaries of the District.
ii. The sign must contain a static panel denoting only the name of the District and this panel should be not less than 20% of the total sign face area of the sign.
iii. The sign may contain a dynamic variable electronic message sign (DVEMS). The total sign face area of this portion of the sign may not exceed 1,300 square feet per side (two sides maximum). The DVEMS must comply with all the standards for DVEMS/electronic message centers outlined under Section IX (Sign Regulations) of the Zoning Ordinance.
Section V – Page 50
iv. The freestanding sign may contain only one district name static panel and the DVEMS. There can be no other permanent or temporary signs attached to this freestanding sign unless granted a Variation by the Village.
v. The DVEMS portion of the sign may only contain the following:
a. Advertising of licensed businesses that have a physical location within the District;
b. Promotion of special events (in particular amphitheater concerts, special events, and sales promotions) located on properties within the District;
c. Promotion of community sponsored events within the Village that support tourism (parades, festivals, athletic events);
d. Emergency notices, special wayfinding notices, traffic control notices, and any other public service notices as deemed necessary by the Village of Tinley Park or the Illinois Department of Transportation.
vi. The DVEMS portion of the sign is expressly prohibited from displaying the following:
a. Advertising products and services for a business that does not hold a business license in the Village and/or does not occupy a physical location in the Village (for example, CarMax can advertise, but Ford Motor Company or General Motors cannot advertise);
b. Advertising individual products or sales items within a business located within the district (for example, CarMax can advertise their business, but not individual cars for sale);
c. Out-of-Rich Township District commercial advertising.
vii. The freestanding sign must meet the requirements for architectural compatibility and landscape as set forth in Section IX of the Village Zoning Ordinance. A site plan and elevation plan will be required to be approved by the Village prior to the sign receiving building permits. The sign cannot be operational prior to building permit approval.
viii. Any changes to this sign, including a sign face change, must comply with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and must be approved by the Village Board. The “District Name” panel, required by this ordinance, may not be changed without the express consent of the Village.
ix. The sign and any part of the freestanding sign structure must be appropriately maintained and the DVEMS portion of the sign must also be maintained and operational in accordance with Section IX of the Village’s Zoning Ordinance. If the sign ceases operation or becomes a public nuisance, the Village may require its demolition. If the sign is damaged due to an act of God, the sign may not be altered from its original condition other than through the approval of the Village.
Section V – Page 51
b. Wayfinding Signs
i. Intent: The Village of Tinley Park intends to develop a municipal wayfinding program to benefit the businesses within the Rich Township Entertainment and Tourism District and the Village as a whole. This wayfinding will direct tourists and visitors to the district and showcase the major entertainment and tourism-oriented businesses within the District, the downtown, and other entertainment and tourism-oriented areas of the Village.
ii. The Village shall provide signage of various sizes and design within the public right of way for wayfinding, consistent with a comprehensive wayfinding program. This wayfinding program shall be permitted by right and shall not require the permission of adjacent property owners or business owners, as the Village Board will have final approval of any comprehensive wayfinding program.
iii. The Village’s wayfinding program shall be documented through right-of-way permits.
iv. Individual businesses may not provide wayfinding signage outside of the limits of their property that may conflict with or compete with the municipal wayfinding program.

If the ownership or management of a nonconforming use is changed, such nonconforming use must be immediately ceased.
B. NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND
Where, at the effective date of adoption of this Comprehensive Amendment, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this Ordinance as enacted, or any amendments thereto, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions and the remaining provisions of this Section, including Subsection C below:
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or building area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;

The obligation for obtaining such certificate rests solely with the owners or interests of the nonconforming use.
Failure to obtain a Certificate of Nonconformance within a period of six (6) months from the date of adoption of this Ordinance will require the amortization of the nonconformance in accordance with the procedures of this Ordinance. This does not negate the option of applying for conversion to a Special Use as provided for herein.
E. CONVERSION TO SPECIAL USE
Any nonconforming use may be converted to a permitted Special Use by the granting of a Special Use Permit, as provided for in this Ordinance.
This conversion may occur only when it is shown that the nonconforming use is providing a particular service to the residents of Tinley Park and that the use is not detrimental to the Village as a whole or to adjacent properties.

SECTION VII
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
Planned Unit Developments are intended to encourage the most imaginative and best possible design of building forms and site planning for tracts of land where a unitary plan would best adapt to the natural and physical characteristics of the site. Under this procedure, well planned residential, commercial, industrial, and other types of land use, individually or in combination, may be developed with complete design flexibility. Planned Unit Developments are of such a size and character that they may create their own environment. Although Planned Unit Developments are Special Uses subject to the Special Use provisions of this Ordinance (see Section X,J) (except as otherwise provided in this Section VII), they are also substantially different from other Special Uses so that specific and additional standards and exceptions are necessary to regulate these developments. Therefore, to assist the Tinley Park Plan Commission in their review and processing of Planned Unit Developments and to govern their recommendations and the action of the Village Board of Trustees, the following regulations are hereby established:
A. PURPOSE
The regulations contained in this Section are established to facilitate and encourage the construction of imaginative and coordinated developments and to provide relief from the subdivision and zoning requirements which are designed for conventional developments, but which may inhibit innovation of design and cause undue hardship with regard to developing a parcel of land to its best possible use. These regulations are further established to provide for developments incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a unit; to assure adequate open space for recreation and other community purposes; to protect residential areas from undue traffic congestion; to encourage the most efficient use of land, which will result in more economic networks of utilities, streets, and other facilities; and thus to promote the general welfare to the community.
B. PROCEDURE
A Planned Unit Development shall be granted as a Special Use in accordance with the following procedures, and may depart from the normal procedure, standards, and other requirements of the other Sections of this Ordinance. Applications shall be made on forms provided by the Village and shall be accompanied by the required plats and documents.
1. Pre-Application Conference: Prior to the official submittal of an application for consideration of a Planned Unit Development, the developer shall meet informally with the Developmental Committee for a preliminary discussion as to the scope and nature of the proposed development, the types of uses proposed, and the approximate land allocations contemplated for each of the uses, and to obtain general information and direction from the committee relative to the long range plans of the Village. The
Section VII − Page 2
developer shall be prepared at that time to present any conceptual plans, maps, sketches, or other information that may be necessary to clearly explain the proposed Planned Unit Development.
2. Application For Concept Approval: The purpose of the Concept Plan Application is to establish a frame of reference for the Village to consider the merits of a proposed Planned Unit Development as it relates to the Comprehensive Plan and to afford a basis for determining whether or not the Village would look favorably toward a Special Use of the property to accommodate a Planned Unit Development of the general nature being proposed. It is intended that the proposal submitted will be in preliminary conceptual form and that following the approval, the developer will proceed with preparing detailed plans for the subject property.
a. Procedure: The required procedure for review of the Conceptual Plan shall be:
(1) Following the pre-application conference with the Developmental Committee, the developer shall submit, in writing, a request for a Special Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development. The letter shall be addressed to the Chairman of the Plan Commission requesting that the proposed development be placed on the agenda of the Plan Commission for preliminary discussion. The Plan Commission shall consider the proposed development at its next regular meeting, or at a special meeting which may be set for the specific purpose of allowing the developer to make a presentation of his plans. Said meeting may be continued from time to time for the purpose of reviewing and processing the application;
(2) The application for concept approval for a Planned Unit Development shall include sufficient supporting data, plans, or information to indicate the extent and nature of the proposed development. In its review, the Plan Commission shall transmit copies of the required plans and documents to the proper individuals or groups concerned with the technical aspects and implications of the proposed development for comment and recommendations. The Plan Commission shall, thereafter, review the application and forward its recommendation to the Village Board;
(3) The President and Village Board, after receipt of the Conceptual Plan from the Plan Commission, shall review the proposed plan and recommendations of the Plan Commission and, within a period of thirty (30) days, shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. The Village Board may require such special conditions as they may deem necessary to ensure conformance with the intent of the planning objectives of the Village and the stated purposes of the Planned Unit Development; and
(4) The granting of the concept approval portion of the Planned Unit Development by the President and Village Board of Trustees shall constitute an acceptance of the specific content of the Conceptual Plan, and shall indicate the general acceptance of the Village Board of Trustees to approve a preliminary plan that carries out, refines, and implements the concepts expressed in the application. The
Section VII − Page 3
Preliminary Plan and Final Plats shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements contained herein.
b. Submission Requirements: The submission of an application for concept approval shall include the following:
(1) A written application for review of a Planned Unit Development on forms provided and in the manner prescribed by the Village;
(2) Sufficient supporting data, plans, or information to indicate the extent and nature of the proposed development; and
(3) A statement of planning objectives to be achieved by the Planned Unit Development. This statement should include a description of the character of the proposed development and the rationale behind the assumptions and choices of the developer.
3. Preliminary Plan Approval: The purpose of the Preliminary Plan submission is to obtain tentative approval and/or commitments from the Village that the plans, design, and program that the developer intends to build and follow are acceptable, and that the developer can reasonably proceed into final detailed architecture, engineering, surveying, and landscape architecture in anticipation of Final Plan Approval and subsequent construction. This is a relatively detailed submission that assures the developer that his plan is acceptable and that he can invest the money necessary to prepare Final Plans with the assurance that the Final Plat and Final Plans will be accepted if they substantially conform to the Preliminary Plans. It is at this stage that final modifications, adjustments, and interpretations are made in the Conceptual Plan.
a. Procedure: The required procedure for review of the Preliminary Plan shall be:
(1) Following approval of the Conceptual Plan, the developer shall file with the Village Clerk a formal application requesting a Special Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development. The application shall be accompanied by a fee which shall be established by the President and Village Board of Trustees;
(2) The developer shall prepare Preliminary Plans incorporating the recommendations made at the time the Conceptual Plan was approved and shall provide sufficient supporting data, plans, or information to indicate the extent and nature of the proposal and that the project is ready for a Public Hearing. The detailed data shall be in accordance with the submission requirements outlined herein. Five (5) copies of all required information shall be submitted;
(3) Copies of the preliminary Planned Unit Development should be sent to the Village’s Planner, Engineer, Director of Public Works, or other municipal departments concerned and to the appropriate school, park, and fire districts providing required public facilities and services for their review, comments, and recommendations.
Section VII − Page 4
Written comments and recommendations shall be returned to the Plan Commission within thirty (30) days unless said period is extended by the Commission, and, if possible, prior to any Public Hearing thereon. In any event, such written comments and recommendations shall be presented to the Plan Commission prior to its decision to recommend the granting or denial of the Planned Unit Development;
(4) The Plan Commission shall hold a Public Hearing on the application for a Planned Unit Development in accordance with the procedures of Section X,J of this Ordinance;
(5) Following the Public Hearing and review of the preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan and supporting data for conformity to these regulations, the Plan Commission shall, within thirty (30) days, unless an extension is requested by the Petitioner, recommend approval, modification, or disapproval, and the reasons therefore, or indicate why a report and recommendation cannot be rendered to the Board of Trustees within this time period;
(6) The Village Board shall thereafter approve, approve with modification, or disapprove the Development Plan and application upon determination that said plan complies with the standards herein set forth. Such action shall be taken within a period of sixty (60) days after receipt of the Plan Commission’s recommendation, unless an extension is requested by the Petitioner. In the case of approval, or approval with modification, the Board of Trustees shall pass an Ordinance granting the Special Use and indicate their approval on the plan. The Board of Trustees may require such special conditions as they may deem necessary to ensure conformance with the intent of all Comprehensive Plan elements and the stated purposes of the Planned Unit Development provisions of this Ordinance; and
(7) Approval of a preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan shall not constitute approval of the Final Plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the Preliminary Plan as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat which will be submitted for approval by the county and subsequent recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and conditions of the preliminary approval, if any. The Final Plat shall be approved if it conforms with the Preliminary Plan.
The Preliminary Plan and Final Plat may be filed and approved simultaneously, or the Final Plat may be filed and approved without a Preliminary Plan if all of the land is to be developed at one time, and if all requirements hereof are met. In the latter case, a Public Hearing conforming to all statutory requirements shall be required during the Final Plat procedure.
No Building Permit shall be issued for any structure until the Final Plat has been filed, approved, and recorded.
Section VII − Page 5
b. Submission Requirements: The applicant shall present to the Plan Commission such other exhibits and written information as may be necessary to describe and illustrate in detail the specific plans for the proposed development of the project. This information shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

(15) A preliminary development schedule indicating the approximate dates when construction of various stages of the development can be expected to begin and be completed.
4. Final Plat Approval: The purpose of the Final Plat is to designate with particularity the land subdivided into conventional lots as well as the division of other lands−not so subdivided−into common open space and building sites. The Final Plat is intended as a document to be recorded and shall be substantially in accordance with the approved Preliminary Plan. If desired by the developer, the Final Plat may be submitted in stages, provided, however, that each stage reflects the approved Preliminary Plan and is in conformance with all the requirements of these regulations.
a. Procedure: The required procedure for approval of a Final Plat shall be:
(1) Following approval of the Preliminary Plan, the developer shall prepare and submit to the Plan Commission a Final Plat to be approved and recorded as a Planned Unit Development Plat;
(2) Upon receipt of all the plans and data required for final approval, the Plan Commission shall review the Final Plat and supporting documents and certify that the plat is in conformance with these regulations and in agreement with the approved Preliminary Plat. If the plat is not in conformance, the Plan Commission shall indicate the reasons therefore and transmit a copy of its findings to the Board of Trustees within thirty (30) days, unless an extension is requested by the Petitioner; and
Section VII − Page 7
(3) After receipt of the Final Plat from the Plan Commission, the President and Village Board of Trustees shall, within a period of sixty (60) days, approve or disapprove the Final Plat. However, no Building Permit shall be issued until the final Planned Unit Development Plat and supporting documents have been recorded with the county Recorder of Deeds, and proof of filing is provided to the Village.
The Planned Unit Development project shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded Final Plat and all supporting data. The recorded Final Plat and supporting data together with all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, and assigns and shall limit and control the use of premises and location of structures in the Planned Unit Development project as set forth therein.
If construction on the proposed Planned Unit Development, or stage or unit of said development last approved has not begun within one year from the date the Final Plat was approved by the Village Board, the authorization shall become null and void and all rights thereunder shall lapse. Upon written application, filed prior to the termination of the one-year time limit, the Village Board may authorize a single extension of the time limit for a further period of not more than twelve (12) months without a public notice.
b. Submission Requirements: The submission for Final Plat Approval shall include:
(1) A detailed Site Plan prepared at a scale of not less than 1" = 100' showing the physical layout and design of all streets, easements, rights-of-way, lots, blocks, common open space, all off-street parking and loading areas, and the exact location of structures and uses;
(2) The plat shall show all radii, internal angles, points of curvatures, tangent bearings, and length of arcs; location, dimensions, and purpose for all easements; all block, lot numbers, and lines, with accurate dimensions in feet and hundredths; names of all streets; and the location of all buildings and setback lines accurately dimensioned;

(9) Estimates of cost of installation of all proposed improvements, confirmed by a registered Illinois engineer;
(10) Final drafts of legal agreements and documents including copies of any easements, deeds of dedication, and other legal documents necessary for the transfer of land and improvements to public and common ownership, restrictive covenants, and a copy of the Articles of Incorporation of the property owner’s, merchant’s or industrial owner’s association, if any;
(11) An accurate legal description and boundary line survey of the area proposed for development in the application for Final Plan Approval, plus satisfactory evidence of ownership;
(12) A final construction schedule, indicating the estimated date scheduled by the applicant for final completion of construction work on required public facilities, land improvements, and on all buildings and private facilities within the proposed Planned Unit Development; and
(13) A completion bond in a sum sufficient to cover the full cost of required public facilities and land improvements; or in lieu of a bond, a deposit of cash; or other negotiable securities or guarantee acceptable to the Village Board of Trustees, all as required by the Ordinance; if a surety bond or other guarantee is posted, it shall have good and sufficient surety thereupon and shall comply with the Ordinance, and be in such form as approved by the Village Attorney; the amount of such deposit or bond shall be based upon the confirmed estimate of cost herein above provided for, and in an amount as required by Ordinance.
5. Recording of Final Plat: Within thirty (30) days following the approval of the Final Plat for all or any portion of a Planned Unit Development or prior to the issuance of any Building Permit, the applicant shall record or cause the recordation of said approved plat with the county Recorder of Deeds.
Upon approval of the Final Plan, the approved Planned Unit Development shall be delineated and designated by number on the Zoning District Map. A file, available for inspection by the public, shall be maintained by the Village Clerk for each Planned Unit Development so designated. The file shall contain a record of the approved development plan and all conditions authorized therein.
6. Deviations and Changes: Although Planned Unit Developments are Special Uses subject to the Special Use provisions of this Ordinance (see Section X,J) (except as otherwise provided in this Section VII), they are also substantially different from other Special Uses so that specific and additional standards and exceptions are necessary to regulate these developments.
Section VII − Page 9
No substantial deviation from plans so approved for the Planned Unit Development shall be permitted without the approval of the President and Village Board of Trustees. If either the developer or owner of the Planned Unit Development wishes to change such Planned Unit Development by deviating from the plans so approved, he or she shall make a written application to the Village for approval of the change. Such application shall be filed with the Director of Planning, who will then proceed to make a written determination of whether the change is a minor or a substantial deviation. If the Planning Director does not find the proposed deviation to be substantial, it shall be referred back to the Plan Commission for approval or denial. If the Planning Director finds the proposed deviation to be substantial, then it shall be referred to the Plan Commission for processing and action on the proposal in the manner as required for concept approval, including the holding of a Public Hearing thereon and a recommendation being sent to the Village Board of Trustees for final action. If the proposed deviation is referred back to the Plan Commission as not being a Substantial Deviation, it shall be acted upon by the Plan Commission. Any deviation, without the necessary approval, shall serve automatically to revoke the original approval and to void future action pursuant to the Planned Unit Development.
a. Substantial Deviation: Any changes which include increases in density, increases in the height and/or bulk of buildings, increases in the size or number of signs, major reductions in the size of the proposed buildings, increases or major decreases in the number of buildings and/or lots, reductions in the amount of proposed open space, changes in the development schedule, any roadway changes, or changes in the final governing agreements, provisions or covenants, or other changes which change the concept or intent of the development, shall be deemed a substantial deviation.
b. Minor Changes: The Plan Commission, or the Village Planner, if authorized by the Village Board, may approve minor changes in the Planned Unit Development which do not change the concept or intent of the development, without going through the preliminary approval steps. Minor changes shall be any changes not defined as a substantial deviation.
C. STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
No Planned Unit Development shall be authorized by the Village Board unless the following standards and criteria are met:
1. General Provisions For All Planned Unit Developments:
a. The site of the proposed Planned Unit Development is not less than five (5) acres in area, is under single ownership and/or unified control, and is suitable to be planned and developed, or redeveloped, as a unit and in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and with the Comprehensive Plan of the Village;

j. Any exceptions or modifications of the zoning, subdivision, or other regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the site are warranted by the design of the proposed development plan, and the amenities incorporated in it, are consistent with the general interest of the public.
2. Residential Planned Unit Developments:
a. The density of any Residential Planned Unit Development shall not exceed the density allowed in the district in which the Planned Unit Development is located, except the Plan Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may grant, an increase in the density up to but not more than twenty (20) percent, provided the
Section VII − Page 11
proposed development provides additional open space and amenities to compensate for the increased density. The Plan Commission, in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre, shall take into consideration:
(1) The physical characteristics of the site that may make increased densities
appropriate in the particular location;
(2) The amount, location, and proposed use of common open space;
(3) The location, design, and type of dwelling units proposed; and
(4) The provision of unique design features such as golf courses, lakes, swimming pools, underground parking, and other similar features within the Planned Unit Development, which require unusually high development costs and which achieve an especially attractive and stable development. Land within the Planned Unit Development, which is used for open space, may be included as gross area for calculations of density.
b. When a Planned Unit Development is proposed in a single-family residential zone, seventy (70) percent of all dwelling units proposed within the zone shall be intended for single-family occupancy. For the purpose of this Section, a townhouse shall be considered as a single-family dwelling;
c. No minimum lot area is required for individual buildings, except that individual lots for single-family detached dwellings, which may be provided within the overall Planned Unit Development, shall not be less than six thousand five hundred (6,500) square feet in area and single-family attached and semi-detached dwelling units not less than three thousand (3,000) square feet of lot area;
d. Not more than six (6) dwelling units shall be permitted in a single-family attached building. “Single-Family Attached Building” is defined as a building containing two or more single-family attached dwelling units joined at one or more points by one or more party walls or common facilities not including the walls of an enclosed courtyard or similar area;
e. When single-family attached dwellings are proposed within a Residential Planned Unit Development, the front or rear facade of a dwelling unit shall not be less than sixty (60) feet from the front or rear facade of another dwelling unit. The unattached side face of a single-family attached building shall not be less than twenty (20) feet from the side face of another such building and not less than forty (40) feet from the front or rear face of another such building or unit;
f. No dwelling unit shall be situated so as to face the rear of another dwelling unit unless adequate landscaping is provided to effectively create a visual separation;
Section VII − Page 12
g. Non-residential or local business-type uses (limited to those permitted in the B-1 Neighborhood Shopping District) may be included as part of a Residential Planned Unit Development when the Plan Commission finds that:

(2) Such uses are not available within reasonable proximity of the subject area;
(3) Are gauged primarily for the service and convenience of the residents of the subject area; and
(4) Are designed as a unit of limited size and made an integral part of the proposed Residential Planned Unit Development.
h. Combination of business and multiple-family residential uses in one structure may be permitted in a structure provided that:
(1) The business uses are limited to personal services and convenience type uses intended solely for the purpose of serving those residing in the multiple-family complex; and
(2) No businesses are permitted on the same floor or above a floor used for residential purposes.
i. Ten (10) percent of the gross land area of a Planned Unit Development, or a minimum of seven hundred fifty (750) square feet per dwelling unit, whichever is greater, shall be developed for recreational open space; except that in multiple-family areas, the minimum square feet per dwelling unit shall be computed on the basis of two hundred (200) square feet for each efficiency and one (1) bedroom unit, three hundred fifty (350) square feet for each two (2) bedroom units, and five hundred fifty (550) square feet for each three (3) or more bedroom units. When private common open space is provided within a Planned Unit Development, such open space shall not be computed as part of the required minimum lot area, or any required yard, or any other structure. Open spaces proposed for either dedication to the public or common ownership by the residents of the Residential Planned Unit Development shall be retained as open space for park and recreational use for the life of the Planned Unit Development. A variety of open space and recreational areas is encouraged, including children’s informal play in close proximity to individual dwelling units according to the concentration of dwellings, formal parks, picnic areas, playgrounds, areas of formal recreational activities such as tennis, swimming, golf, etc.;
j. Each Residential Planned Unit Development shall provide for the visual and acoustical privacy of each dwelling unit.

All buildings within a Residential Planned Unit Development shall be set back not less than twenty-five (25) feet from a public dedicated street, and along the exterior boundaries not adjoining a street, there shall be a minimum setback of forty (40) feet plus one (1) foot for each additional foot that the building increases in height over thirty-five (35) feet;
p. A twenty (20) foot buffer including, but not limited to, solid fences, masonry walls, or plant materials, shall be provided so as to constitute the visual screening of all parking areas and outdoor activity areas from adjacent property or rights-of-way at ground level. Where a buffer already exists on the adjacent property line, or where parking areas or similar activity areas adjoin each other on adjacent properties, the buffer requirements may be waived by the Plan Commission; and
q. When the development is to be constructed in stages or units, a sequence of development schedules shall be provided showing the order of construction of each principal functional element of such stages or units, the approximate completion date for each stage or unit, and a cost estimate for all improvements within each stage or unit.

A combination of business, office, and multiple-family residential uses in one structure may be permitted in a Commercial Planned Unit Development provided the structure contains at least two hundred (200) dwelling units or more; that the building is at least five (5) stories in height; that not less than one-half (1/2) of the floors are devoted to residential use; and that no business is permitted on the same floor or above a floor used for residential purpose, except that one penthouse-type commercial restaurant, may be permitted on the top floor or roof of such structure if recommended by the Plan Commission and approved by the Village Board;
f. Off-street parking, based upon five-and-one-half (5 1/2) car parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of gross leaseable area, shall be provided in all Commercial Planned Unit Developments, unless the Plan Commission recommends and the Village Board requires additional off-street parking. Such parking shall be paved, adequately lighted, and well drained. Where there are great expanses of blacktop pavement, trees and planted areas shall be introduced to take away the otherwise barren and unsightly appearance;
g. Where a combination of uses is planned, additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided unless the Plan Commission determines that individual parking spaces may adequately serve two (2) or more uses by reasons of the hours of operation of such uses;
h. At least ten (10) percent of the total lot area of the Commercial Planned Unit Development shall be provided for landscape purposes;

1. Screening and Landscaping: Off-street parking areas for five (5) or more vehicles, and off-street loading areas, shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on property situated in a residential district, or any institutional premises by a fence and/or densely planted compact hedge, not less than four (4) feet nor more than seven (7) feet in height;
2. Minimum Distances and Setbacks: No off-street loading area or parking area, or part thereof, for five (5) or more vehicles, shall be closer than ten (10) feet to any dwelling, school, hospital, or other institution for human care located on an adjoining lot, or five (5) feet from any lot line;
3. Surfacing: Any off-street parking, or off-street loading area, shall be surfaced with an impervious surface. All areas shall be marked so as to provide for the orderly and safe loading, parking, and storage of self-propelled vehicles;
4. Lighting: Lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking or loading area, shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises. Off-street parking facilities for multiple-family dwellings shall be adequately lighted;
5. Drainage: Any off-street parking area and off-street loading area shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of all surface water without detriment to surrounding uses; and

2. Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities: In cases where parking facilities are permitted on a lot, other than the lot on which the building or use served is located, they shall be and remain in the same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-street parking facilities shall be authorized, and no occupancy permit shall be issued, until and unless the Zoning Board of Appeals has reviewed the plans, heard the applicant, and made
Section VIII – Page 8
findings that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue, and that the off-site parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue, and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the proposed building or use.
Section IX – Page 1
SECTION IX
SIGN REGULATIONS
A. PURPOSE & INTENT
The standards used in displaying signs can significantly affect the public safety as well as the value and economic stability of adjoining properties. However, a reasonable display of signs is necessary for both residential and non-residential properties.
Signs may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, cause visual blight, and/or pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this Section is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This Section allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This Section must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this Section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity of other provisions of this Section which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs.
These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by this State, the federal government or this Village. The inclusion of “government” in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps illuminate the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation.
No Discrimination Against Non-Commercial Signs or Speech: The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed under this Section may substitute non-commercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or non-commercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any other non-commercial message. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel or allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message.
Section IX – Page 2
B. PERMIT REQUIREMENT
Prior to the display and erection of any sign, a permit is required to be obtained through the Village’s Building Department, except as provided in Section IX.B.4.
1. Application: An application for a sign permit must be filed with the Community Development Department on forms furnished by that department. The Applicant must provide sufficient information to determine if the proposed sign is allowed under this code and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances.
2. Fees:
a. One (1) dollar per square foot of facing, but no less than fifteen (15) dollars for all signs requiring a permit, other than temporary signs, canopies, awnings, or marquees;
b. Fifty (50) dollars for a temporary sign; and
c. One hundred (100) dollars for a canopy or awning.
3. Revocation of Permit: If a sign is not installed within six months following the issuance of a sign permit (or within 30 days in the case of a temporary sign permit), the permit shall be void. The Village may revoke a sign permit under any of the following circumstances:
a. The Village determines that information in the application was materially false or misleading;
b. The sign as installed does not conform to the approved sign permit application;
c. The sign violates the Village’s applicable codes or other any applicable law, regulation, or ordinance; or
d. The Zoning Administrator or their designee determines that the sign is not being properly maintained or has been abandoned.
4. Exceptions: Signs meeting the criteria below are exempt from the requirement to obtain a permit through the Village’s Community Development Department. If a sign does not meet the requirements of an exempt sign as stated within this Section, the sign may be permitted by obtaining a Sign Permit or the sign may be prohibited (see Section IX.M. for Prohibited Signs).
a. Signs required and/or erected by government agencies.
Section IX – Page 3
b. Political signs on private properties not exceeding a total of thirty-two (32) square feet in area (total of all sign faces visible from the public right-of-way) per property and not exceeding five feet (5’) in overall height in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1-12, as amended from time to time. For the purposes of this regulation, “Political Signs” are defined as temporary signs that announce or support political candidates, parties, issues, or causes in connection with any national, state, or local election.
c. One (1) non-illuminated temporary sign no larger than four (4) square feet in area (total of all sign faces visible from the public right-of-way) and four feet (4’) in height may be attached to the building or erected on private property provided that it is a minimum of one foot (1’) from all property lines and in compliance with Section IX.I.1.d.
d. One (1) non-illuminated temporary sign no larger than sixteen (16) square feet in area (total of all sign faces visible from the public right-of-way) and four feet (4’) in overall height may be attached to the building or erected on private property provided that it is a minimum of one foot (1’) from all property lines and in compliance with Section IX.I.1.d. in the following circumstances:
i. When the property is being offered for sale by owner or through a licensed real estate agent – provided that the sign shall be removed within fourteen (14) days following the date on which a contract of sale has been executed by a person purchasing the property;
ii. When the property is under construction – provided that a building permit has been issued for the project and the sign shall be removed within fourteen (14) days following the date of the final inspection; or
iii. When a residential property owner is opening their residential property to the public – provided that the sign shall be displayed for no more than three (3) consecutive days twice per calendar year.
e. Substitution of commercial copy to non-commercial copy on sign(s) in non-residential zoning districts (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, ORI, and M-1), provided that the sign face area and sign height are not increased and the location of the sign is not changed.
Section IX – Page 4

Section IX – Page 8
D. PERMANENT SIGN STANDARDS (WALL, FREESTANDING, AWNING, & CANOPY)
1. Wall Signs:
a. Size: The allowable size of a wall sign is determined by Zoning District, then by the gross floor area of the tenant space, and then the linear frontage of the wall on which the wall sign is located in accordance with Section IX.E., Section IX.F., Section IX.G., and Section IX.H.
b. Number of Wall Signs: The allowable number of wall signs is determined by Zoning District, then by the gross floor area of the tenant space, and then by tenant frontage directly parallel to a public right-of-way, an access drive, or the adjacent parking lot in accordance with Section IX.E., Section IX.F., Section IX.G., and Section IX.H.
c. Location:
i. All wall signs shall be located on the same façade as the use they identify.
ii. No wall sign shall extend above the top line of the face of the building, nor shall any wall sign project into the public right-of-way, or extend more than twelve (12) inches outward from the face of the building.
iii. Wall signs shall be located a minimum of twelve (12) inches from the edge of a wall.
iv. Wall Sign Location for a Single Tenant Building: The location of the sign should be as close to the entrance of the business as possible. Effort shall be made to not conflict with the architectural elements of the building façade.
Section IX – Page 9
v. Wall Sign Location for a Multi-Tenant Building: The location of the sign should be centered within the tenant’s frontage limits along the building frontage of the business. Effort shall be made to not conflict with the architectural elements of the building façade. In cases where architectural elements conflict with centering the sign on the building frontage, the tenant shall locate the sign as close to the center of the tenant frontage as possible. All wall signs for multi-tenant structures must be placed in accordance with an established center line for all signs.
d. Materials: Permanent wall signs shall be constructed of materials that can withstand the elements in an outdoor environment. Acceptable materials for wall signs include, but are not limited to: acrylic, polycarbonate, marine grade plywood (MDO), aluminum, and aluminum composite materials (ACM).
e. Illumination: Wall signs can be internally illuminated or externally illuminated, or a combination of both. External illumination shall be shielded so as to direct light only to the sign and not create a nuisance. Illumination mechanisms must be properly maintained. Additionally, illumination of wall signs is subject to the regulations within Section IX.C.5.
f. Wall Signs for Interior Tenants: Businesses located within another business, without having a distinct secured entrance of their own, are permitted a maximum of fifteen (15) square feet of wall signage
g. Letter Height: Maximum letter height for wall signs is noted within Section IX.E., Section IX.F., Section IX.G., and Section IX.H. Each letter
Section IX – Page 10
shall be measured individually for compliance with the maximum letter heights.
h. Lines of Lettering: No more than two (2) lines of lettering shall be allowed on any wall sign.
i. Background Color:
i. Multi-Tenant Building: Sign backgrounds that are inconsistent with the existing color palette of the building shall be counted as part of the sign face area.
ii. Single-Tenant Building: Sign backgrounds that are inconsistent with the existing color palette of the building shall be considered as an architectural feature rather than constitute sign face area.
Section IX – Page 11
2. Freestanding Signs:
a. Size: The allowable size of a freestanding sign is determined by Zoning District and then by the linear frontage of the lot on which the freestanding sign is located in accordance with Section IX.E., Section IX.F., Section IX.G., and Section IX.H.
b. Number of Freestanding Signs: The allowable number of freestanding signs is determined by Zoning District and then by lot frontage directly parallel to a public right-of-way, an access drive, or the adjacent parking lot in accordance with Section IX.E., Section IX.F., Section IX.G., and Section IX.H.
c. Location: Freestanding signs shall be only constructed within the premises of the development that the sign identifies and shall not be constructed in the public right-of-way. Additionally, freestanding signs shall not be located within easements. Freestanding signs must be set back a minimum of ten feet (10’) from all property lines. Freestanding signs shall not obstruct clear sight triangles near intersections.
d. Materials: Permanent freestanding signs shall be constructed of materials that can withstand the elements in an outdoor environment. Acceptable materials for wall signs include, but are not limited to: acrylic, polycarbonate, marine grade plywood (MDO), aluminum, and aluminum composite materials (ACM). The base of the sign may also include, but is not limited to: brick, stone, and concrete. Said materials must also comply with Section IX.D.2.f.
Section IX – Page 12
e. Illumination: Freestanding signs can be internally illuminated or externally illuminated. External illumination shall be shielded so as to direct light only to the sign and not create a nuisance. Illumination mechanisms must be properly maintained. Additionally, illumination of freestanding signs is subject to the regulations within Section IX.C.5.
f. Architectural Compatibility: Freestanding signs shall be architecturally compatible with the building(s) it identifies. For new construction, architectural compatibility shall be determined by the Plan Commission through the Site Plan Approval process. For permanent freestanding signs constructed by an existing business or use the architectural compatibility shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator or their designee through the building permit process. The following architectural guidelines shall be considered in the review of freestanding signs:
i. The sign shall have the same or similar materials (color, scale, finish) to the materials used for the principal building;
ii. The sign shall be in harmony with or consistent in design to the principal building;
iii. The sign shall have similar architectural treatments as the principal building; and
iv. The sign shall not block or obstruct architectural features of the principal building.
g. Structural Supports: Structural supports for a freestanding sign shall be fully enclosed and be equal in width to the sign face or wider; structural supports shall not be exposed to view. The base of the freestanding sign shall be designed to be an architectural enhancement to the sign as noted in Section IX.D.2.f.
h. Landscaping: Freestanding signs shall include extensive landscaping around the base of the sign to screen the base of the sign from view from the adjoining street and adjoining properties. The total area devoted to landscaping around the base of the sign shall be equal to two (2) square feet per each one (1) square foot of freestanding sign face area, but in no case shall the total area of landscaping be less than 20 square feet and need not be greater than 200 square feet. The landscape area shall contain well-maintained living landscape materials. New freestanding signs erected on
Section IX – Page 13
existing sites that are unable to provide the required area for landscaping must meet the spirit of the landscaping requirements and such landscaping can be approved by the Zoning Administrator or their designee during the building permit process.
i. Lettering on Base of Sign: No advertising or lettering of any type shall be permitted on the sign base except for the address of the property on which the sign resides.
j. Panel Design Consistency: All sign panels advertising individual businesses within a freestanding sign must be consistent in background color, method of illumination, and materials. Font face and font color are allowed to differ per the property owner’s/tenant’s preference.
k. Sign Face Area for Multiple Faces: When two identical freestanding sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the total sign face area shall be the sign face area of one side of the sign. In all other circumstances, the sign face area of a freestanding sign shall be the total sign face area of all sign faces on the freestanding sign.
Section IX – Page 14
l. Freestanding Sign Height: The height of a freestanding sign is a measurement of the full height of the sign, including the base or support structure and any design element surrounding or enclosing the sign face. The measurement includes the vertical distance from the adjacent existing, natural ground level to the top of the sign, including any decorative element, which may enclose the sign. The average natural grade is measured by surveying the grade of the land within ten feet (10’) of the location of the proposed freestanding sign.
3. Awnings and Canopies:
a. Location: Lettering and signage is prohibited on awnings or canopies.
b. Design: Awnings and canopies shall be complimentary to the architecture of the building.

The members of the Zoning Board of Appeals appointed pursuant to the provisions of a prior Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Tinley Park in office at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, shall continue as members of the Zoning Board of Appeals for the remainder of the term for which they were appointed and until their successors are appointed and
Section X – Page 4
qualified, and the Chairman of said Zoning Board of Appeals in office at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, shall continue as such Zoning Board Chairman for the remainder of the term for which he was appointed and until his successor is appointed and qualified. At the expiration of the respective terms of office of the present members and thereafter, the members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be appointed by the President and Board of Trustees for staggered terms of five (5) years each as provided in the Illinois Municipal Code and until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified. The Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals or, in his absence, the Acting Chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. The President and the Board of Trustees of the Village of Tinley Park shall have the power to remove any member of said Zoning Board of Appeals for cause and after a Public Hearing. Vacancies upon said Zoning Board of Appeals shall be filled for the unexpired term of the member whose place has become vacant by appointment made by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Tinley Park. The word “Board”, when used in this Section hereafter, shall be construed to mean the Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. Meetings and Rules: All meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such times as such Board may determine. All hearings conducted by said Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent, or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall also keep records of its hearings and other official actions. Findings of Fact shall be included in the minutes of each case of a requested variation, and the reasons for recommending or denying such variation shall be specified. Every rule or regulation, every amendment or repeal thereof, and every order requirement, decision, or determination of the Board shall be filed immediately in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure not in conflict with this Ordinance or with the Illinois statutes in such case made and provided, and may select or appoint such officers as it deems necessary.
3. Jurisdiction: The Board shall have the following jurisdiction and authority:
a. It shall be its duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of law in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance; and
b. In hearing and deciding appeals, the Board shall have the power to:
(1) Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of this Ordinance;
(2) Interpret the provisions of this Ordinance in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the map fixing the several districts, accompanying, and made a part of this Ordinance, where the street layout actually on the ground, varies from the street layout as shown on the map aforesaid;
(3) Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or public enemy to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its assessed value, where the Board finds some compelling
Section X – Page 5
necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use, and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly;
(4) Extend the period within which a nonconforming business or industrial use is to be removed from a dwelling district and nonconforming industrial buildings in any business or commercial district when the owner or owners can furnish substantial proof that the building was so extensively remodeled, reconstructed, or structurally altered after the original construction that it practically resulted in a new building, but such extension of the period shall not exceed twenty (20) years from the date of such remodeling, reconstruction, or structural alteration;
(5) Waive the parking requirements in the shopping, business, or industrial districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of parking facilities, or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience; and
(6) Permit a variation in the yard requirements of a district where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical, or other conditions, provided such variation will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
c. Whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this Ordinance relating to the use, construction, or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land will impose hardship, it shall be within the power of the Board to recommend such variations of the strict application of the terms of this Ordinance as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the Board is satisfied that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the Comprehensive Plan as established by this Ordinance, and at the same time the surrounding property will be properly protected; and
In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to this Ordinance, the Board shall, before making any variation from the Ordinance in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to an adjacent property, or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare of the inhabitants of the Village of Tinley Park. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is authorized by this Ordinance to render a decision; and
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the Board the power
Section X – Page 6
or authority to alter or change the Zoning Ordinance or the Zoning District Map, such power and authority being reserved for the President and the Board of Trustees of the Village of Tinley Park in the manner hereinafter provided.
d. “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it shall be within the power of the Board to permit a variation from the requirements hereunder in connection with the location, construction requirements, and other provisions relating to fences, pools, decks, and sheds where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these which seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare and further provided that no variation shall be granted which would allow a fence to be more than ten (10) feet in front of the building setback line(s), (there being two building setback lines on corner lots). Pursuant to the provisions of 11, 13, 5 of the Illinois Municipal Code, the decision of the Board as to any such variation in the requirements regarding fences, pools, decks, and sheds shall be final and such power is hereby vested in the Board; provided, however, if the affected property owner or any nearby property owners who are affected by the decision, object to the decision of the Board, any such interested property owner may appeals the decision of the Board to the Village Board for final decision. In other words, the Board’s decision is final, unless appealed to the Village Board. Any such appeals to the Village Board shall be made in writing and shall be filed with the Village Clerk within fourteen (14) days of the decision of the Board. If no such appeal is timely made, the decision of the Board shall be final. If such an appeal request is timely made, the Village Board shall adopt an appropriate Ordinance either affirming the decision of the Board, reversing the decision, or affirming it with modifications. Any such Ordinance of the Village Board shall be in the form of an Ordinance either granting or denying the requested variation, with or without conditions.”
F. APPEALS
An appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by an office, department, board, or bureau aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator under this Ordinance, in accordance with Illinois statutes and the following:
1. An application for any appeal shall be filed with the Director of Planning within twenty (20) days of the date of the action from which the appeal is being filed, and thereafter the Director of Planning shall forward such application to the Board for processing and also shall forward to the Zoning Administrator a Notice of Appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and also shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
2. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the Notice of Appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
Section X – Page 7
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application and on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due causes shown.
3. The Board shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, for the hearing of the appeal, and give due notice thereof to the parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination that in its opinion ought to be made on the premises, and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal was taken.
G. VARIATIONS
1. Authority: Except as specifically provided below in Section X.G.5 and above in Section X.E.3.B.(6), and X.E.3.D, the Village Board of Trustees shall decide all applications for variations of the provisions of this Ordinance after a Public Hearing held before the Board. The Board shall, except as provided in Section X.G.5 below, hold a Public Hearing upon all applications for variations and, except as provided in Section X.E.4 above, report its recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees for action. The Board shall not approve where it has final decision-making power, nor shall it recommend where it does not, any variation unless the Board has made Findings of Fact specifying the reason or reasons for recommending or approving the variation. Such findings shall be based upon the standards hereinafter prescribed. Also, where the Village Board decides whether to grant a variation hereunder, no variation shall be granted by the Village Board without such Findings of Fact. If a request for a variation, however, is combined with a request for rezoning, a Special Use Permit or a Planned Unit Development, then the Plan Commission of this Village shall have jurisdiction over such request, shall conduct a Public Hearing thereon, and shall make the Findings of Fact and recommendation to the Village Board in the same manner and under the same standards and procedures as set forth herein for the Board.
2. Initiation: An application for a variation may be made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by an office, department, board, bureau, or commission requesting or intending to request application for a Building Permit, Zoning Certificate, or Occupancy Certificate. The filing fee for a variation on a residentially-zoned property shall be one hundred fifty (150) dollars. The filing fee for a variation on a non-residentially zoned property shall be two hundred (200) dollars.
3. Application for Variation and Notice of Hearing: An application for a variation shall be filed with the Director of Planning, who shall forward a copy of same, without delay, to the Board or Plan Commission, as the case may be. The application shall contain such information as the Board or Plan Commission may require. No more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such application, a hearing shall be held on the application. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing date, in a newspaper published within the Village, and if there is none, then in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Section X – Page 8
Village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the Board or Plan Commission may require.
4. Standards for Variations: The Board or Plan Commission, as the case may be, shall not recommend a variation of the regulations of this Ordinance, as authorized herein, unless it shall have made Findings of Fact, based upon the evidence presented to it, in each specific case that:
a. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in the district in which it is located;
b. The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
c. The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
d. For the purpose of implementing the above rule, the Board or Plan Commission shall also, in making its determination whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by the evidence:
(1) The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
(2) The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
(3) The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property;
(4) The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the owner of the property, or by a previous owner;
(5) The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and
(6) The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to an adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
e. The Board or Plan Commission may recommend, and the Village Board of Trustees may require, such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this Section
Section X – Page 9
to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such a variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general intent of this Zoning Ordinance.
5. Authorized Variations: From the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be approved (where it has final decision-making power) or recommended (when it does not) by the Board, or the Plan Commission if applicable, only in accordance with the standards set out in this Section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others:
a. To permit, without the necessity of a Public Hearing, up to a twenty (20) percent reduction in the front, side, or rear yard required by this Ordinance. A greater variation may be recommended, but only after a Public Hearing as required by law;
b. To permit the use of a lot or lots for use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots;
c. To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two or more uses provided the substantial use of such facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week;
d. To reduce, without the necessity of a Public Hearing, the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than one (1) parking space or loading space, or twenty (20) percent of the application regulations, whichever number is greater. A greater variation may be recommended, but only after a Public Hearing as required by law;
e. To increase the gross area of any sign;
f. To extend the period of time a nonconforming use may continue or remain; and
g. Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or public enemy to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its assessed value, where the Board finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use, and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly.
6. Other Variations: Other than those listed above may be granted by the Village Board, but only after a Public Hearing as set forth herein for an authorized variation, and a report from the Board or Plan Commission recommending for or against the variation.
7. Required Vote: The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Village Board of Trustees or three (3) members of the Village Board of Trustees and the President shall be necessary to reverse the recommendation of the Board or Plan Commission on any requested variation.
Section X – Page 10
H. AMENDMENTS
1. Authority: The regulations imposed and the districts created under the authority of this Ordinance may be amended from time to time by Ordinance in accordance with the applicable statutes of the State of Illinois. An amendment shall be granted or denied by the Village Board of Trustees only after a Public Hearing before the Plan Commission and a report of its findings and recommendations has been submitted to the Village Board.
2. Initiation: Amendments may be proposed by the Village Board of Trustees, Plan Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, or by any person, firm, or corporation having a freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application for an amendment.
3. Application for Amendment and Public Hearing: An application for an amendment shall be filed with the Director of Planning. Such application shall be forwarded, without delay, by such Director to the Plan Commission, with a request to hold a Public Hearing. Notice shall be given of the time and location of the hearing, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing date, by publishing a notice thereof at least once in one or more newspapers published within the Village of Tinley Park, or if no newspaper is published therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the Village of Tinley Park.
4. Decisions: The Village Board, upon report of the Plan Commission and without further Public Hearing, may grant or deny any proposed amendment, or may refer it back to the Plan Commission for further consideration. In case a written protest against any proposed amendment signed and acknowledged by owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley therefrom, or by owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be altered is filed with the Village Clerk, the amendment cannot be passed except on the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the Village Board of Trustees.
I. PLAN COMMISSION
1. Jurisdiction: The Plan Commission of the Village of Tinley Park, which has been duly established, is the Plan Commission referred to in this Ordinance, and shall have the following duties under this Ordinance:
a. To receive and review all applications for amendments and Special Uses and to submit reports of findings and recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees;
b. To receive, hear, and recommend to the Village Board matters dealing with the granting of Planned Unit Developments;
Section X – Page 11
c. To initiate, direct, and review from time to time, studies of the provisions of this Comprehensive Amendment and to make reports of its recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees, not less frequently than once each year;
d. To hold any Public Hearings required by law to be held on any of the foregoing matters; and

At all hearings conducted by said Plan Commission under this Comprehensive Amendment, the Chairman, and, in his absence, the Vice Chairman, shall have the power to administer oaths. All testimony by witnesses at any hearing provided for in this Comprehensive Amendment shall be given under oath. The Plan Commission shall keep minutes of its proceedings, and shall also keep records of its hearings and other official actions. A copy of every rule or regulation, every Special Use, and every recommendation, order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Plan Commission under this Ordinance, shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk and shall be a public record. The Plan Commission shall adopt its own rules and procedures, not in compliance with this Ordinance or with applicable Illinois statutes.
J. SPECIAL USES
1. Purpose: The development and execution of the Zoning Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are Special Uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such Special Uses fall into two categories:
a. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; and
b. Uses entirely private in character, but of such nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
2. Authority: Special Use Permits may be authorized or denied by the Village Board of Trustees, but only after a Public Hearing has been held, in the manner prescribed herein for amendments to this Ordinance, and a written report outlining the findings and recommendations of the Plan Commission has been prepared and submitted to the Village Board. All Special Use requests shall be heard by the Plan Commission including requests for Planned Unit Developments.
Section X – Page 12
3. Initiation: An application for a Special Use may be made by any person, firm, or corporation having a free-hold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application for a Special Use. The filing fee for a Special Use shall be four hundred (400) dollars.
4. Application for Special Use: An application for a Special Use shall be filed with the Director of Community Development on the form provided and shall be accompanied by such plans and data as specified by the Plan Commission.
5. Standards: No Special Use shall be recommended by the Plan Commission unless said Commission shall find:
a. That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the Special Use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare;
b. That the Special Use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
c. That the establishment of the Special Use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
d. That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided;
e. That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; and
f. That the Special Use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the Village Board pursuant to the recommendation of the Plan Commission. The Village Board shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a Special Use Permit as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the above standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such permit upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this Ordinance. Failure to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance.
g. The extent to which the Special Use contributes directly or indirectly to the economic development of the community as a whole.
Section X – Page 13
6. Not Covenant Running with the Land:
Except as provided in Section VII.B.6 as to Planned Unit Developments, the approval of a Special Use, when granted, shall not run with the land or constitute a covenant running with the land, but instead shall expire automatically if:
a. There is a change in the use other than necessary maintenance and repair;
b. There is a change in the ownership of either the land and/or the business or use conducted on the land provided, however, if the change in ownership is to another member(s) of the immediate family (parents, siblings, or children), such shall not cause the automatic expiration of the Special Use;
c. The use is abandoned, closed, or terminated for a period in excess of sixty (60) days, provided; however, if the use is closed solely to make repairs, alterations, or remodeling such shall not cause the automatic expiration of the Special Use;
d. The use is not changed but the business/use commences operations under a different name (but not including merely in a change in the legal name of the owner, such as from Ltd. to LLC, provided that the actual owners of the entity do not change); or
e. The use operates under a franchise and the franchise is either revoked or terminated, or a new franchise is substituted (a mere change in the name of the franchise, e.g. from Kentucky Fried Chicken to KFC, without any other changes shall not cause an automatic expiration of the Special Use).
K. MAP AMENDMENT (REZONING)
An application to amend the official Tinley Park Zoning District Map, particular to one or more parcels of land, may be made by any person, firm, or corporation having a free-hold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application to amend the Zoning District Map.

Q. DISCLOSURE OF BENEFICIARIES OF A TRUST
The liabilities hereunder imposed on an owner shall attach to a trustee under a land trust, holding title to such building, structure, or premises without the right of possession, management, or control, unless said trustee in a proceeding under said provisions of this Ordinance discloses in a verified pleading or in an affidavit filed with the court, the name and last known address of each person who was a beneficiary of the trust at the time of the alleged violation and of each person, if any, who was then acting as agent for the purpose of managing, controlling, or collecting rents, as the same may appear on the records of the trust.

INTRODUCTION
2 0 1 1 L EGAC Y CODE

2011 Downtown Legacy Code
1
Adopted 07.19.2011
The Legacy Code is intended to be used in conjunction with the Legacy Plan. The Tinley Park
community set forth the Legacy Plan with a clear vision and preferred urban design arrangements
for the downtown and beyond. The Legacy Code implements the Legacy Plan by codifying
Tinley Park’s vision with a purposefully specific and precise form-based approach.
This Legacy Code was created to strengthen the aesthetics and economics of the downtown by
implementing the following principles, set forth in the Legacy Plan:
A. Purpose
1. Preserve Tinley Park’s unique historic heritage.
2. Ensure that new development respects the historic scale and character of downtown.
3. Building a strong economic future for Downtown Tinley Park.
4. Maximize the number of people living within walking distance of the train station.
5. Encourage building mass to peak at the downtown core.
6. Create a walkable downtown where pedestrians come first.
7. Create a connected roadway framework with small walkable blocks.
8. Promote a green downtown showcasing leadership in the preservation of natural resources
and sustainable practices.
9. Position downtown as a focal point of the regional bike path system.
Section 1
Village of Tinley Park
2
Adopted 07.19.2011
The Legacy Code is intended to allow for the continued function of contemporary land uses,
while creating standards and design criteria for infill and redevelopment projects. The Legacy
Code regulations have been developed to accomplish the goals of the Legacy Plan by:
1. Regulating building form to create a street wall of appropriately scaled buildings that address
the street and create a pedestrian-oriented setting.
2. Prohibiting the placement of off-street parking in front yards in order to maintain the
continuity of buildings along the street, minimize the views of parked cars, and provide
adequate sidewalks and amenities for pedestrians and bicyclists.
3. Prohibiting drive-through facilities and other automobile related uses to encourage an
environment where pedestrian comfort and safety comes first, residential homes can be
established near the street, and curb cuts are minimized.
4. Regulating streets and rights-of-way to encourage landscaped streetscapes and complete
streets that accommodate multiple modes of travel.
5. Concentrating commercial development in a walkable downtown core and transition areas
outside the core to residential development to create a supportive neighborhood market.
6. Creating architectural standards to ensure that new buildings comply with the community’s
shared vision.
7. Create a review process that rewards compliance with the Legacy Code and Legacy Plan
with a shortened review process.

that is otherwise provided for in any other section
of the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations,
or Building Code, the applicable provisions of
those sections shall apply.
D. Severability
Should any section or provision of this section of

Review
Non-Conformance &
Special Approvals
Site plan does not meet
the spirit or intent of the
Legacy Plan, and/or requires
a special approval, such as:
a Special Use Permit, map
amendment, and/or a variance
from the Legacy Code.
Moderate Conformance
Site plan matches the spirit
and intent of the Legacy
Plan, but there are some
qualitative differences that
do not require a variance
from the Legacy Code, and
needs no special approvals.
Precise Conformance
Site plan matches the development
and redevelopment
scenarios presented in the
Legacy Plan, including use,
site plan, massing, and architectural
details. Proposal
requires no variances from
the Legacy Code, and needs
no special approvals.
F. Process Overview
Section 1
The following provides a concise overview of the general review process. The intent of this
code is to reward those who strive to meet its standards and regulations. Therefore, the length
of review time and number of meetings required to obtain project approval shall be based
upon the degree of conformance to this code. Those changes involving existing structures will
typically not require public meetings unless determined by Village staff that the nature of the
modifications warrant review by Village Commissions and/or the Village Board. A complete
description of the process and submission requirements is located on pages 81-90.

Key
Legacy Code Boundary
DG Heritage Site Blocks
Heritage Sites are those lots with structures and uses that
were lawfully existing prior to the adoption of the Legacy
Code. Heritage Sites are generally classified as such until
they incur site improvements that exceed 50% of the property’s
market value.
b. Applicability
This section shall apply to projects involving lot improvements
less than 50% of a property’s market value as well as
changes of property ownership and/or building use within
the Downtown General District only (see Figure 2.C.6).
a. Intent
The intent of this section is to establish regulations that
govern the use and voluntary modification of Heritage
Sites, and to specify the circumstances and conditions
under which such properties are required to implement
certain improvements aimed at decreasing their degree of
non-conformity, if applicable. The purpose is to meet the
goals of the Legacy Plan while protecting the interests of
Heritage Site owners and tenants.

Permitted uses of structures and land as set forth in Table 3.A.1 shall be allowed according
to the regulations set forth for each district and each building form. Permitted uses may be
approved by either administrative review or by site plan review by the Plan Commission,
depending on the nature of the improvement. Only those uses listed in Table 3.A.1 shall be

than a use that is permitted here, with the exception of uses that were lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this ordinance; and accessory uses, in compliance with this ordinance.
Special Uses of structures and land are set forth in Table 3.A.2. The special uses existing as of
the date of adoption of this Legacy Code are listed in Appendix D. Such special uses shall be
deemed to be and shall be treated as Heritage Sites hereunder and shall be governed by the
applicable regulations relating to Heritage Sites. These uses create off-site impacts or design
issues that require special consideration by the Plan Commission and approval by the Village
Board. Petitions for uses that are listed as Special Uses shall be reviewed at a Public Hearing
according to the procedures set forth in Section X.J (Special Uses) of the Zoning Ordinance.
Any findings of fact by the Plan Commission shall incorporate review and recommendations
by the Main Street Commission and Historic Preservation Commission. The Village Board
may impose conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a Special Use as may
be necessary to assure compliance with any standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such
a use on the other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of
this ordinance. Failure to comply with conditions of a Special Use shall constitute a violation
of this ordinance and may result in a revocation of the Special Use.
Some uses that would otherwise be allowed in other areas of the Village shall not be allowed in
all Legacy Code districts. This is because the nature of these uses is inconsistent with the intent
and purpose of this code and the adopted Legacy Plan. Any existing prohibited use may change
owner as long as no new prohibited use is created. Prohibited uses of land and structures are
listed in Table 3.A.2.
1. Permitted Uses
2. Special Uses
3. Prohibited Uses
This section of the Ordinance’s significant departure from traditional zoning and the previous
H-1 Historic District Overlay has increased the number of existing non-conformities within
the districts created. Typically non-conformities are encouraged to discontinue or are required
to be removed over a time period. However, the unique characteristics of the Legacy Code
Area and this code demand a more flexible approach to non-conformities. The significant
contributions many existing uses and structures have made towards establishing the Legacy
Code Area’s identity require that they be treated in a manner that respects their existing characteristics,
but also aims to update these uses and structures in a manner that also fulfills the
vision of the Legacy Plan. Therefore, existing sites have been identified as “Heritage Sites”
within this code. As these sites seek to redevelop, change ownership, and/or expand (under
50% of market value) a series of criteria has been established that build upon the vision of the
Legacy Plan, without being overly burdensome to those that established the Village’s heritage.

8. Architectural Guidelines
The following guidelines present the architectural qualities and details deemed desirous by
the Village for projects within the Legacy Code Area:
General A consistent style of architectural composition should be applied
throughout a structure. A mix of styles is discouraged.

be articulated through changes in architectural treatments and/or
materials.
Articulated Corner Buildings located at intersections should feature articulated corners
in the form of architectural treatments and/or unique private
frontages.
Windows Wherever practical, ground floor windows should remain free of
internal obstructions in order to allow for views into and out of
the building. Windows on the upper floors should be smaller in
size than storefront windows on the ground floor.
Awnings Awnings should only be located within the established width of a
functional window or door frame.
Sign Band A sign band should be provided above storefront windows to accommodate

Cornice Structures should be capped with a cornice, which is a horizontal
projection that can include elements such as decorative brick and
stone work, and ornamental brackets.
9. Heritage Site Guidelines

is required to conform to the material standards found in Section
3.B.4.
Building Expansion Wherever practical and appropriate, building expansions should
be located at the front of a structure in order to bring the building
into closer conformance with a district’s front yard setback and reimage
the structure to better reflect the above architectural guidelines.

Village of Tinley Park
84
Adopted 07.19.2011
6. Representatives of the Main Street Commission and Historic Preservation
Commission may prepare formal recommendation for Village Board consideration
on any application proposed in any district in this code that was recommended
for approval by the Plan Commission and which does not address the requested
changes or conditions of approval proposed by the Main Street Commission and
Historic Preservation Commission or in the event that the Plan Commission
recommendation for approval is contrary to the recommendations proposed by
the Main Street Commission and Historic Preservation Commission.
c. Site Plan Review by Plan Commission – Certain improvements require site plan approval
because of the proposed changes to the site or building and the scope of the project. Site
plan review by the Plan Commission typically involves two public meetings for review by
the Plan Commission and one workshop with assigned Plan Commission members.
d. Site Plan Review by Plan Commission and Village Board – Certain improvements require
site plan review and approval by the Plan Commission and Village Board because the
application requires that an ordinance be considered. Any Public Hearing required for
approvals granted by the Village Board will be held by the Plan Commission. Site Plan
Review by the Village Board typically involves two public meetings.
e. Exempt - Regular maintenance and repair are exempt from any reviews and approvals.

1. Process Determination
The process for meetings and approvals for projects requiring site plan review will be determined
by Village staff, based upon the relative conformity to the Legacy Plan and this code, and also
based upon whether or not a Special Use, variance(s), and/or rezoning are required.
B. Public Meetings Required
Figure 5.B.1
Section 5
Non-Conformance &
Special Approvals
Site plan does not meet
the spirit or intent of the
Legacy Plan, and/or requires
a special approval, such as:
a Special Use Permit, map
amendment, and/or a variance
from the Legacy Code.
Moderate Conformance
Site plan matches the spirit
and intent of the Legacy
Plan, but there are some
qualitative differences that
do not require a variance
from the Legacy Code, and
needs no special approvals.
Precise Conformance
Site plan matches the development
and redevelopment
scenarios presented in the
Legacy Plan, including use,
site plan, massing, and architectural
details. Proposal
requires no variances from
the Legacy Code, and needs
no special approvals.

the property creates a hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
2. The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based would not be
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
3. The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more
money out of the property;
4. The granting of the variance would not be detrimental to the public welfare or

1. Additional Standards for Cross Parking & Cross Access Agreements
Off street parking facilities for automobiles are encouraged to be provided for collectively or
shared. The Plan Commission must approve a shared parking arrangement through site plan
review and under the following conditions:
a. A shared parking analysis is conducted, following the standards of the Urban Land
Institute, and indicates that reduced parking standards between uses can be supported
because of the hourly parking demand associated with each business is different; and
b. There is adequate parking proposed to serve each business sharing the parking during the
peak hour associated with each use; and
c. There is a written acknowledgement from all property owners that are party to the
collective or shared parking that the shared parking approval will only be recognized by
the Village if the current arrangements of commercial and residential square footages on
the property remain the same. If these arrangements change by change of use or change
of owner, expansion or redevelopment, new parking improvements may be required; and
d. The arrangement is formalized through officially recorded cross access and cross parking
agreements.
Section 5
a. The development does not have the benefit of shared or collective parking;
b. The applicant proves that adequate parking exists for such use, based on the unique number,
type and use characteristics (i.e., peak hour or day) of those businesses or residences that
currently use such a lot;
c. A municipal or commuter parking lot exists within 300 feet of the development that has
adequate parking to accommodate all or a portion of the number of required spaces for
the use;
d. The owner of the building makes a payment equal to $1,000 per required automobile and
bicycle parking space that cannot be provided on the subject lot. The fees collected for the
payment in lieu of parking will be used only for the acquisition of land or construction
of municipally owned or leased off street parking facilities for automobiles or bicycles;
landscape or streetscape; bike trails, lanes, or paths; or maintenance or illumination of
off-street parking facilities.
I. Parking Agreement Standards and Waivers
2. Additional Standards Specific to a Parking Waiver
The number of off-street automobile or bicycle parking spaces required in the Downtown Core
District (only) may be reduced by an administratively granted Parking Waiver approved by
Village staff under the following conditions:
a. The waiver requested is for 50% or less of the total required parking for the site to meet
commercial automobile and/or bicycle parking requirements.
b. The waiver is not for residential parking requirements. Residential parking requirements
cannot be waived.
c. A municipal lot exists within 300 feet of the business that has adequate parking to
accommodate all or a portion of the number of required spaces for a new tenant or use or
a public commuter parking lot exists within 300 feet of the business and can be used on
weekends and weekdays (after 11:30 a.m.);
d. The development does not have the benefit of shared or collective parking;

surrounding single family residential neighborhoods with overflow parking and traffic.
f. The owner of the building makes a payment equal to $1,000 per required automobile and
bicycle parking space that cannot be provided on the subject lot. The fees collected for the
payment in lieu of parking will be used only for the acquisition of land or construction
of municipally owned or leased off street parking facilities for automobiles or bicycles;
landscape or streetscape; bike trails, lanes, or paths; or maintenance or illumination of

The Legacy Plan recommends that the 80 foot and 100 foot sections of Oak Park Avenue transition
in the long term to a boulevard with a landscaped median at the center. The diagrams
below show options for how sidewalks, medians, bike lanes and traffic lanes can transition
between the narrower 66 foot section and the future boulevard sections.

Access Drive
A private driveway that links parking facilities to an abutting public street.
Accessory Residential Uses
A use that is subordinate to residential dwelling units which contribute to the comfort and
convenience of the dwelling units. An Accessory Residential Use may include, but not be
limited to: recreational space, laundry facilities, sales/rental offices, and/or parking for the
private use of those residents of the dwelling units. When located within a mixed-use structure,
Accessory Residential Uses must maintain the same commercial architectural character
or appearance as the street level commercial space. Laundry facilities shall not be located at
street level along the building frontage.
Attached Parking
A parking structure of one or more levels that is connected to a building but that is situated
either in whole or in part outside the footprint of the building.
Below Grade Parking
Parking facilities located either in whole or in part below grade.
Block End
A lot having at least two (2) adjacent sides abut for their full length upon a street.
Building Height
The number of stories between the floor of the first story (exclusive of basements or cellars)
and the roof, and shall include both habitable and mechanical space.
Commercial
Retail, service, or office uses as noted in Table 3.A.1. and Table 3.A.2. of the Legacy Code.

1. Applicability
Where conflicts occur between these definitions and those found in other sections of the Village’s
Zoning Ordinance and this section of the Zoning Ordinance, the regulations of this
section supersede.
2011 Downtown Legacy Code
105
Adopted 07.19.2011
Heritage Sites
Those lots with structures or uses that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the Legacy
Code. Heritage Sites are generally classified as such until they incur voluntary, private-owner
initiated site improvements that exceed 50% of the property’s market value, at which time
they shall be reclassified as redevelopment sites and subject to the pertinent provisions within
its district. Absent such voluntary, private-owner initiated site improvements, Heritage Sites
may retain their Heritage Site status in perpetuity, and can change owner and/or use, be maintained
and repaired as part of normal upkeep, undergo site improvements that do not exceed
50% of the property’s market value, and be rebuilt following an Act of God, all without altering
this status. In those instances involving an Act of God (i.e. natural disaster, fire, etc.),
nonconforming uses and building types lawfully established at the time of the event may be
reestablished, provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree of
nonconformity is not increased, and with the condition that the property be reconstructed to
meet the private lot, corridor and alley standards of its district. In order to reestablish previous
nonconforming uses and building types following an Act of God, a building permit relative
to such reestablishment must be obtained within one (1) year of the date of the damage or
destruction by an Act of God, and construction must be completed within one year of issuance
of the building permit. In the event that the permit is not obtained within one (1) year from
the date of damage or destruction by an Act of God, or construction is not completed within
one (1) year of the issuance of the building permit, the Heritage Site status shall be lost, and
the building or use must thereafter conform to those allowed in the District.
Lineal Frontage (Block)
The distance as measured along the front lot line of one or more properties abutting one (1)
side of a thoroughfare and lying between the two nearest intersecting streets as determined by
staff.
Lot Assemblage
The assemblage of two (2) or more contiguous parcels to form a single lot.
Market Value
Shall mean and be determined, within the Legacy Code Area, by dividing the assessed valuation
of the property as determined by the Cook or Will County Assessor, and as shown on
the most recent tax bill for the property, by the level of assessment used by the Assessor for the
type of property (i.e. vacant, single-family, commercial, etc.). For example, a property with an
assessed valuation of $40,000, and a level of assessment of 16%, shall have a Market Value of
$250,000 (40,000/.16).
Mixed-Use
A mixed-use building contains residential dwelling units above or behind ground floor commercial,
group assembly, and/or civic uses, and may be designed to accommodate office and/
or group assembly space on the second level.
Moderate Conformance
Project proposals shall be considered in Moderate Conformance with the Legacy Code when
Village staff determines that the plans match the spirit and intent of the Legacy Plan, but there
are qualitative differences (i.e. site layout) that do not require a variance from the Legacy
Code, or need special approval.

Public Frontage
The publicly held area between the curb of the thoroughfare and the front lot line of a parcel.

assemblage and/or when voluntary, private-owner initiated site improvements exceed 50% of
the property’s market value. Redevelopment Sites include those lots, structures, and uses that
did not lawfully exist prior to the adoption of the Legacy Code, those lots that are, at present,
undeveloped, and those lots that lose their status as Heritage Sites by operation of a provision
of the Legacy Code.
