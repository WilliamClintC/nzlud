Board ("ARB") to serve as an advisory body to the Planning Commission,
Zoning Commission, and Zoning Board of Appeals on matters of
commercial site and building design and multifamily housing sites and

duties and shall meet at least twice a year and other such times as it

land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot.
FLOOR  The top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including
basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood
flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of

NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter, May 23, 1982 (not
the revision date).
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  A vehicle which is:
START OF CONSTRUCTION  For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barriers Resources Act (P.L.
97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring
of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction

of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding
in any given year. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevation
(BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a
community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are only
approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs
published in the FIS for a specific location. The SFHA is also called the "area
of special flood hazard."

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any combination of repairs,
reconstruction, alterations or improvements to a structure taking place over
a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50% of the

market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be:
(1) the appraised value of the structure (using the cost approach to value)
prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case
of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For
the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include
any improvements project required to comply with existing health, sanitary
or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade
facilities or infrastructures.
VARIANCE  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner
otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
VIOLATION  Failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the required permits, lowest floor
elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway
encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as
that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION  The height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified),
of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal
or riverine areas.
§ 238-3. Floodplain District.
The Floodplain District includes all special flood hazard areas designated
as Zone A, A1-30 on the Town of Marlborough Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM) on file with the Town Clerk. These maps, as well as the
accompanying Town of Marlborough Flood Insurance Study dated
September 26, 2008, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Since mapping is legally
adopted by reference into this chapter it must take precedence when more
restrictive until such time as a map amendment is obtained.
§ 238-4. General standards.
Within Zone A, A1-30, the following standards must be met prior to issuing
permits for any proposed construction/development.
A. Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including
the effects of buoyancy.
§ 238-2 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 238-4
1:50
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
(3) For new construction and substantial improvements: require that
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely
for the parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage in an
area other that a basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
the exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following criteria: a minimum of two openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings
shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
C. Utilities.
(1) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
(2) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems.
(3) New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
(4) On-site wastewater disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from
them during flooding.
D. Compensatory storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain,
except those areas that are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced.
Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial
improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall
be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain.
Storage shall be provided on site, unless easements have been gained
from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage;
it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the
theoretical volume of floodwater at each elevation, up to and including
the one-hundred-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the
proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted
hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body.
Compensatory storage can be provided off site if approved by the
municipality.
E. Equal conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are
tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new
§ 238-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-4
1:51
construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in
footprint of the structure are prohibited unless the applicant provides
certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with
supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not
result in any (0.0 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation).
Work within the floodplain and land adjacent to the floodplain, including
work to provide compensatory flood storage, shall not be constructed in
such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
F. Aboveground oil tanks. Aboveground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.),
which are located outside or inside of the structures, must be either
elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad or
securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral
movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and
have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of floodwater.
G. Portion of structure in flood zone. If any portion of a structure lies within
the special flood hazard area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered
to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction
requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached
additions, garages, decks, sunrooms or any structure attached to the
main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive
flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the
more restrictive zone.
H. Structures in two flood zones. If a structure lies within two or more flood
zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply
to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone:
structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any
attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms or any other structure
attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a
more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the
standards of the more restrictive zone.)
I. No structures entirely or partially over water. New construction,
substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained
substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or
partially over water.
§ 238-5. Development regulations.
In all areas of flood hazard in A1-30, AE, AH, where base flood elevation
data has been provided, the following regulations shall apply:
A. Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structures shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
B. Nonresidential construction.
(1) New construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential
structures shall be constructed in accordance with Subsection A
above or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
(a) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
§ 238-4 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 238-5
1:52
(b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy.
(2) A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or
develop structural design specifications and plans for construction
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to
the Town Engineer as set forth in § 238-6.
C. New structures within the floodway are prohibited.
D. Within the floodway designated on the Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map, all encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements to existing structures, and other development, are
prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided by the applicant, demonstrating that such encroachment shall
not result in any (0.00) increase in flood levels during the occurrence
of the one-hundred-year flood. In A Zones where base flood elevations
have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new
construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including
fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more
than one foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated
development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
Should data be requested and/or provided, the Town shall adopt a
regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be
able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation more than one foot at any point along the watercourse.
E. Manufactured homes shall not be placed in the Floodplain District.
F. All recreational vehicles to be place on a site within an area of special
flood hazard must either: (1) be on a site fewer that 180 consecutive
days (2) be fully licensed and ready for highway use; (3) meet elevation
and anchoring requirements for residential construction described in
Subsection A of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
§ 238-6. Establishment of development permit.
A. A development permit shall be obtained from the Town Engineer before
construction or development begins within Zone A, A1-30.
B. The Town Engineer shall review permits to assure sites are reasonably
free from flooding and require that all other local, state, and federal
permits are obtained.
C. Alteration of watercourse. Prior to any initiation of such alteration, the
Town shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Energy and
Environmental Protection's Water Resources Unit prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
§ 238-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 238-6
1:53
(2) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
D. Within Zone A, the applicant shall provide to the Town Engineer any base
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, including data developed pursuant to § 238-7D of this chapter.
The Town Engineer shall review such data and may reasonably use it as
criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development in Zone A meet the standards of §§ 238-4 and
238-5.
E. Information to be supplied by the applicant, obtained by the Town
Engineer and maintained by the Building Official:
(1) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
to which any floodproofing is effective; and
(2) Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially
improved structures:
(3) Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in § 238-5B.
(4) The Building Official shall maintain for public inspection all records
pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
§ 238-7. Subdivision standards for Floodplain District.
All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall be
reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If any part of a subdivision proposal or other development is
located within the Floodplain District established under the chapter, the
Town Engineer and the Planning Commission shall review it.
A. The proposal is designed to be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage; and
B. All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage; and
C. Adequate drainage systems shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and
D. Base flood elevation (the level of the one-hundred-year flood) and
floodway data shall be provided for that portion within the Floodplain
District.
E. Land located within the floodway shall not be subdivided for building
lot purposes unless sufficient land area is available outside the floodway
area, as part of the lot, for the structure and subsurface disposal system.
§ 238-8. Appeals and variances.
The Building Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals relating to the
enforcement and administration of this chapter and requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
A. A variance shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
§ 238-6 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 238-8
1:54
B. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
C. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
D. If a variance is granted, the Building Appeals Board shall notify the
applicant in writing over its signature that: the issuance of such variance
to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and such construction below the
base flood level increases risks to life and property.
E. The Building Appeals Board will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the annual report submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
§ 238-9. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
law, regulations, ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
§ 238-10. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by the chapter is considered the
minimum reasonable for regulatory purpose and is based on scientific
and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas
or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Town of
Marlborough or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
§ 238-11. Penalties for offenses.
In accordance with C.G.S. § 7-148(b)(1), any person(s) or party found to be
in violation of this chapter will be subject to a fine of $250 a day for each
day such violation continues, as well as being responsible for all Town legal
fees and costs that are a result of court action.

applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The
commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the
storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this article: waterline flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains
(not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space

§ 301-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 301-6
1:105
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one part per
million chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source
not containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time
of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit,
waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge
to the storm drain system.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a
connection to continue.
§ 301-7. Suspension of MS4 access.
A. Suspension of illicit discharges in emergency situations. The authorized
enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of
persons or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
(1) Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may
have his MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency
will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
reconsideration and hearing.
(2) A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access
to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
approval of the Authorized enforcement agency.
§ 301-6 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 301-8
1:106
§ 301-8. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 301-9. Monitoring of discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If
a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must
be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
(3) The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger
at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs
of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge
permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility
with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
§ 301-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 301-9
1:107
(7) If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged,
and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
§ 301-10. Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying
best management practices for any activity, operation or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premises, which is or may be the
source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
§ 301-11. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 301-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
§ 301-9 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 301-12
1:108
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent is recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 301-13. Enforcement.
A. Notice of violation. Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds
that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement
of this article, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance
by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require, without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring analyses and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
§ 301-14. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received
within 15 days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the Inland Wetlands Commission shall take place within 45
days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the
Inland Wetlands Commission shall be final.

1:109
§ 301-15. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within 15 days of
the decision of the Inland Wetlands Commission, then representatives of the
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission shall enter upon the subject
private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary
to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for
any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse
to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the
premises for the purposes set forth above.

Within 15 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within 15 days. If the amount due is not paid in a timely manner,
as determined by the decision of the Inland Wetlands Commission or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this article shall become liable to the Town by reason of such
violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments.
Interest at the rate of 18% per annum shall be assessed on the balance
beginning on the 15th day following discovery of the violation.
§ 301-17. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provisions or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this article, the authorized
enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations
or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
§ 301-18. Compensatory actions.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and remedies authorized
by this article, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
§ 301-19. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement process and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this article is a threat to public health, safety and welfare and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the

obstructing safe access to that public work, the Town may take
immediate remedial action. Any and all expense of such remedial action
shall be payable by the property owner, or if caused by a person who is
not the owner shall be payable jointly and severally by that person and
by the owner of the property containing the discharge. If such illegal
discharge does not make an immediate nuisance or hazard, and the
corrective action outlined in a notice by the Town is not made within
the time frame specified in said notification, the change may be made by
the Town and the expense thereof shall be and remain, until paid in full

of the specific correction to be performed by the Department of Public
Works. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Department of Public
Works to perform such work may appeal the decision to the Board
of Selectmen within 30 days of the receipt of said notice. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to relieve a person from immediately
remedying a violation of § 306-9E as ordered pursuant to this article.
D. The costs of such removal or other necessary action performed pursuant
to this article shall be a lien upon the premises concerned, provided

No building permit shall be issued for any building unless the lot upon
which the building is to be located shall have frontage on either: (1) a
"street" as defined in Article IV of this chapter; or (2) a proposed street in
an approved subdivision with respect to which all required improvements
with the exception of paving, loaming and seeding have been completed

if it is deemed by the Commission to be the only prudent and feasible
access to the sites or if the Conservation Commission submits a written
recommendation that the common driveway would diminish the adverse
impact on an inland wetland or watercourse conservation area. An
appropriate easement and maintenance agreement shall be filed on the
Marlborough Land Records to indicate that a right-of-way has been
conveyed for the shared portion of the driveway.
D. Driveways shall not exceed a maximum length of 1,000 feet unless
otherwise approved by the ZEO, based upon a recommendation from
the Fire Marshal, with consideration to the relative location of a water
source for fire suppression, the slope of the driveway and the ability
for the adequate maneuverability of emergency vehicles. Driveways that
exceed 500 feet in length may be subject to additional standards
required by the Fire Marshal as a means to ensure the reasonable
safety of persons occupying or using any premises in the Town. These

zoning compliance, all previous special permit or site development
plan approvals shall be deemed to have been superseded by the new
special permit approval, and no such use shall thereafter change
to a new special permit or site development plan use without the
approval of the Commission under the applicable procedure.
H. Partial bond release. The Commission shall not release a portion of
a performance bond to a remaining balance of less than 25% of the
original bond amount in instances where work remains to be performed.
I. Record drawings and bond release.
(1) Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and prior to the
release of the performance bond, the Commission shall require that
one Mylar and four paper copies of a record drawing are submitted
to and approved by the Commission when a site development plan
was included with the special permit.
(2) Upon written request by the applicant, the Commission shall have
the ZEO, the Town Engineer and, when deemed necessary by the
Commission, the Building Inspector and the Fire Marshal perform
an inspection to determine whether the conditions of approval have
been met and whether all of the required site improvements have
been completed in accordance with the approved plans and permits.
Based upon these findings, the Commission may authorize release of
the bond and approval of the record drawing.
§ 340-5.1 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.1
1:190
(3) Upon approval, the signed Mylar record drawing shall be recorded
by the record landowner at his expense in the office of the
Marlborough Town Clerk. Any record drawing not so recorded
within 90 days following the date of approval shall become null and
void.
J. Conditional record drawing approval.
(1) During the period beginning December 1 and ending April 1 or due
to seasonal or weather-related conditions, the Commission, and the
ZEO where authorized, may at its discretion issue conditional record
drawing approval where plantings, earth grading and seeding have
not been completed.
(2) The conditional record drawing approval may be issued for a period
not to exceed 180 days. Upon written request by the applicant,
completion of the remaining site work and submission of the record
drawing, the Commission may release the remainder of the bond,
and the Chairman shall sign the record drawing.
K. Amendments.
(1) Construction and site improvements shall be completed in strict
compliance with the permit approved by the Commission. However,
amendments to an approved special permit may be made, provided
that an application is submitted to and approved by the ZEO or by
the Commission.
(2) If the ZEO determines that the construction or plan modifications
are of a minor nature and do not materially affect the construction
drawings, the Commission may waive the requirements for a public
hearing only by unanimous vote of the Commission members voting
on the request.
L. Conditions for revocation. A special permit may be subject to revocation
by the ZEO if any condition or safeguard imposed by the Commission
upon land, buildings, structures and/or uses for said special permit are
not strictly adhered to by the applicant and/or landowner. The ZEO shall
adhere to the procedures detailed in Article XV of this chapter whenever
a special permit must be revoked.

§ 340-5.3. Site development plan.
Pursuant to C.G.S. § 8-3(g), a site plan is required for certain uses permitted
within this chapter to determine the conformity of a proposed building, use
or structure with the provisions of this chapter. This section establishes
procedural and informational requirements for site plans. These
requirements are in addition to other applicable standards and
requirements of this chapter. Site plan applications, except those
accompanying a special permit, will be acted upon by the Commission
under the provisions of C.G.S. § 8-7d(b). The Commission may hold a public
hearing on any site plan. In the case of site plans accompanying a special
permit application, the plans will be considered as part of the special
permit application, and action on the plan will be taken in accordance with
§ 340-5.1 of this chapter.
A. Applicability. Site development plan approval issued by the Commission shall be
required for:
(1) All buildings, construction or change of any use of land or structure in GC, GI,
VCD, DBIZ, DC, DI, DR and DMR Zones.
(2) In accordance with Article VI, for special permits in residential zones.
B. Application procedure.

placement of the proposal on the agenda of a regular or special meeting of
the Commission for the purpose of presenting preliminary plans or concepts
and receiving preliminary comments, observations and questions, and
identifying areas of concern. At this time the purpose of the informal
discussion(s) is to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to all
interested parties and to assist a potential applicant in understanding
appropriate design parameters desired by the Town. The informal discussion
shall not be deemed to constitute any portion of the official and formal
procedure of applying for a site plan. Neither the proponent nor the
Commission shall be in any way bound by statements made in such informal
discussions.
§ 340-5.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:193
(b) At the informal discussion of the Commission, the applicant may request
a full or partial waiver of site plan requirements under this article of the
chapter above. Following informal discussion, the Commission may suggest
that the proposal, or certain aspects thereof, be referred to other municipal,
state or federal agencies for review and comments or may advise the
potential applicant that additional information will be required prior to
action on a formal application for site plan approval.
(2) Submission of the application to the administrative official must be made at
least six days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting. The official date of receipt
of a site plan application will be the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Commission immediately following the day of submission of the complete
application to the Commission's designated agent or 35 days, whichever is
sooner.
(3) If any proposed activity is under the jurisdiction of the Marlborough
Conservation Commission29 under provisions of C.G.S. Chapter 440, the report
of said Commission, together with any permit issued for regulated activities,
will be submitted with the site plan. In accordance with Connecticut General
Statutes, the Commission will not act on a site plan application until the report
of the Conservation Commission has been received and considered.
(4) After submission of the application and its receipt, the Commission shall within
65 days render a decision on the application. The applicant may consent in
writing to up to an additional 65 days to process the application.
(5) The Commission shall notify the town clerk of the adjoining municipality by
certified mail of the pendency of any application within seven days of receipt of
an application concerning any project on any site when in the sole opinion of the
Commission:
(a) Any portion of the property affected by a decision of the Commission is
within 500 feet of the boundary of the adjoining municipality; or
(b) A significant portion of the traffic to the completed project on the site will
use streets within the adjoining municipality to enter or exit the site; or
(c) A significant portion of the sewer or water drainage from the project on
the site will flow through and significantly impact the drainage or sewerage
system within the adjoining municipality; or
(d) Water runoff from the improved site will impact streets or other municipal
or private property within the adjoining municipality.
(6) The Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the
application. Notice of the decision of the Commission shall be communicated
to the applicant by certified mail within 15 days after such decision has been
rendered. Notice of the decision of the Commission shall be published in a
newspaper having a substantial circulation in the Town within 15 days after such
action has been taken. The Commission shall state on the record its reason for
its decision.
C. Application requirements. The site development plan application shall include the
following:
(1) An application fee and technical review fee.

MARLBOROUGH ZONING COMMISSION, MARLBOROUGH, CT
DATE APPROVED DATE OF EXPIRATION
CHAIRMAN
SECRETARY
(q) All test pit and percolation test data and the dates that the tests were performed.
D. Performance standards and criteria. The following criteria shall be satisfied to
protect the public health, safety and welfare of the public at large. The applicant
shall furnish in writing together with any application for use sufficient evidence
that the proposed use will not produce any nuisance in excess of the measurable
performance standards listed below.
(1) No smoke or other air contaminant shall be discharged into the atmosphere for
a period or periods aggregating more than three minutes in any one hour which
is darker in shade than is designated at No. 2 on the Ringlemann Chart, as
published by the United States Bureau of Mines, or which is of such capacity as
to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than does smoke
designated at No. 2 on the Ringlemann Chart.
(2) Offensive odors, as defined by Section 22a-174-23 of the regulations
promulgated by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection, shall not discharge beyond the property line of an operation that
stores, uses or produces a substance which will cause said odor. Any
determination of a violation of Section 22a-174-23, as may be amended from
time to time, constitutes a violation of this provision. Where lot lines bounding
an industrial use adjoin a residential district, there shall be no offensive odors
noticeable at said lot's property lines.
(3) No noise or vibration which is objectionable due to volume, frequency or
shrillness shall be transmitted outside the property where it originates.
(4) No offensive or harmful wastes shall be discharged into any stream,
watercourse, adjoining property, sanitary sewer, septic system, or storm drain.
(5) No activity shall be conducted which is hazardous or dangerous to persons or
property.
E. Building design standards. Architectural renderings of the building elevations
(front/side/rear) shall be submitted to the Commission for its review and approval
along with a floor plan. The facade of all buildings that are visible from any street
or other public areas shall be of some architectural treatment approved by the
Commission.
(1) Exterior siding materials shall be of decorative masonry, wood, metal, stone
or approved alternate material. Exterior design features, including materials,
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:197
texture, color and trim detailing, shall be included on all building elevations to
the extent which maintains overall design continuity.
(2) Monotonous building forms are to be avoided by using various methods to help
create interest and reduce scale. Examples include the staggering of vertical
walls, recessing openings, providing upper-level roof overhangs, using deep
score lines at construction joints, contrasting compatible building materials, and
using horizontal bands of compatible colors. A variety in roof shapes and form
is encouraged to add diversity of the buildings as well to enhance scale and
complement the features of nearby buildings. Where parapet walls are used,
they should be treated as an integral part of the building design.
(3) The size of windows and doors should relate to the size of the wall in which
they appear. Monotonous repetition should be avoided where possible in the
location, size and shape of windows and small doors. Mirrors or highly reflective
glass shall not cover more than 20% of a building surface visible from a street.
Additionally, utility doors, fire doors, loading docks and other potentially
unsightly service features should be designed to blend with the building's
architecture.
(4) Primary buildings in close proximity on the same property should have
harmonious proportions and similar architectural styles. Nearby accessory
buildings should be of compatible design and treatment.
(5) Mixed-use buildings containing nonindustrial uses should highlight the public
entry to the structure to create a sense of human scale and to emphasize a
primary entry feature.
(6) The mixing of unrelated architectural styles, materials and details is to be
avoided.
(7) All HVAC and other building utility systems shall be screened from view from
the public street and abutting property.
F. Site preservation and landscaping. The application shall include a landscape plan
and a site constraint plan prepared by a State of Connecticut-licensed landscape
architect. The characteristics of the site are to be incorporated into the design to
take advantage of topographic features, provide buffering of adjoining land uses,
and retain the prominent natural landscape and environmental features of the
property through:
(1) Minimizing soil and tree removal.
(2) Design grading to blend with the natural terrain and avoid creating steep slopes.
(3) Treating disturbed surfaces to encourage plant growth and soil stabilization by
providing the necessary topsoil and planting of the appropriate native species of
trees, shrubs and grasses.
(4) Preserving the significant natural features of the site, such as stonewalls, rock
outcrops, wetlands, prominent tree stands, and vistas.
(5) The area between the buildings and the street shall be landscaped in a way
to provide visual interest, with a mixture of grass, different species of shrubs,
trees, ground cover, annuals and perennial plants, except for walks, drives,
flagpoles, and other landscaping and ornamentation.
(6) Buffer strips of 50 feet shall be necessary when the site is abutting a residential
zone. If existing vegetation does not provide an adequate buffer, the area shall
be supplemented with hardy indigenous plant material, shrubs and trees.
(7) Low-impact stormwater design best management practices shall be an integral
part of all drainage and landscaping plans.
§ 340-5.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.3
1:198
G. Pedestrian access. On-site pedestrian walkways shall be provided between parking
areas and the building, as well as a walkway across the frontage of the lot along
the public street that terminates at the abutting property line. Sidewalks shall be
six feet wide and set back 10 feet from the curbline of a public street; however, the
Commission may vary these standards based on site conditions and the ability to
make linkages to other sidewalks. The applicant is to provide site interior walkways
that link street/drive walks with existing or future multimodal sidewalk/trail system.
H. Utilities. All developments shall provide underground utilities in both public and
private extensions of said utilities. All developments shall provide proper design
and construction of cable, electrical and phone lines, natural gas, community septic
systems, sanitary sewers, public water supply, and stormwater management system.
Switching-gear cabinets, transformers and similar aboveground utility equipment
shall be installed as shown on the site development plan, and a proper landscaping
plan shall be submitted to screen these structures from view from abutting property
and the public street.
I. Sewage disposal.
(1) The Commission shall not approve any special permit or site plan application
unless and until the Commission has been provided with a positive tentative
staff determination from the applicable governing authority with respect to the
compliance of the proposed sewage disposal system with applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements and/or from the Marlborough Water Pollution
Control Authority if the site is to be serviced by sanitary sewers or a community
septic system.
(2) Additionally, if the application proposes a community sewage disposal system,
as a condition to any approval granted by the Commission, the applicant shall
present to the Commission acknowledgement from the Marlborough Water
Pollution Control Authority that it has approved an operation and maintenance
agreement, including an escrow account for the maintenance and repair of said
community sewage disposal system.
J. Water supply.
(1) The Commission shall not approve any special permit or site plan application
unless and until the Commission has been provided with:
(a) If the proposed water system is not a community water system as defined by
the State Department of Health and State Department of Utility Control, a
letter of approval for the well location from the Chatham Health District; or
(b) If the proposed water system is a community water system as defined by the
State Department of Health and State Department of Utility Control, a letter
from the exclusive service area provider acknowledging the submission
of the application and its interest in ownership of said system, together
with a Phase I-A approval from the State Department of Public Health and
State Department of Public Utilities Control for all water supply wells in
accordance C.G.S. § 16-262m(a) prior to the close of the public hearing.
(2) Any approval granted by the Commission shall be conditioned upon receipt by
the Commission of a Phase I-B approval from the State Department of Public
Health and State Department of Public Utilities Control prior to issuance of any
building or zoning permits for the construction of any buildings.
K. Stormwater management.
(1) Purpose is to establish stormwater management requirements and controls
to protect and safeguard the quality of the groundwater and surface water
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:199
resources of Marlborough and to reduce adverse impacts associated with
increases in peak rates of stormwater runoff.
(2) Objective.
(a) Incorporate decentralized stormwater management systems in any new
development designs;
(b) Minimize the increases in peak rates of stormwater runoff from any
development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion,
and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and downstream drainage
structures;
(c) Minimize the increase in non-point-source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local
groundwater and surface water quality;
(d) Minimize the total volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the
predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
(e) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-pointsource
pollution wherever possible through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly
maintained and designed to minimize potential threats to public safety.
(3) Design and performance criteria. In order to prevent the adverse impacts
of stormwater runoff, the Commission has developed a set of performance
standards that must be addressed in the design of any new site development
plan or modification to an existing site development plan that disturbs 5,000
square feet or more of area.
(a) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge
stormwater runoff directly into a natural wetlands system, water body,
municipal drainage system or abutting property without adequate
pretreatment;
(b) A vegetative separation shall be maintained to provide a disconnection
between impervious surfaces and the natural wetland systems of the site
and abutting sites;
(c) All stormwater best management practices shall be designed to minimize
the need for maintenance while maintaining water quality discharge
treatment standards;
(d) All site development plans shall be designed to minimize the need for
stream bank/channel protection for the receiving natural system, but when
required shall include provisions to prevent erosion and scouring of the
stream bank/channel;
(e) The design of all stormwater best management practices shall convey
stormwater runoff in a manner to allow for the maximum removal of
pollutants and reduction in flow velocities;
(f) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with a higher potential
pollutant loading may require the use of specific pretreatment structural
methods and pollution prevention practices;
(g) All site development plans shall include the design of stormwater detention
or retention facilities to attenuate the increase in peak rates of stormwater
runoff for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year twentyfour-
hour-duration storm events to provide for a zero post-development
increase whenever practical.
§ 340-5.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.3
1:200
(4) Sensitive waters and wetlands: enhanced criteria.
(a) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources, such as
the Blackledge River, Dickinson Creek, Lyman Brook, Fawn Brook, Flat
Brook, Lake Terramuggus and their contiguous wetlands, may be subject
to additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain
stormwater management practices. Land development that discharges to
sensitive waters and wetlands as noted above shall meet enhanced criteria.
These may include but are not limited to:
[1] Nutrient sensitive waters. Enhanced control of nutrients and sediment
removal for stormwater discharges shall be required.
[2] Cold-water fisheries. Techniques to control temperature increases from
stormwater discharges into these streams and water bodies shall be
required.
[3] Groundwater. Enhanced recharge and pretreatment of stormwater
discharges shall be required to protect groundwater supplies.
[4] Wetlands. Controls to minimize impacts to the natural or
predevelopment wetland hydrology, including limiting adverse
fluctuations in surface water and groundwater elevations.
(b) In these cases, the Commission may require additional storage capacity,
treatment, filtering, infiltration or other mitigation techniques. The use of
nonstructural practices shall be used to the maximum extent practical to
meet enhanced criteria. In making its determination to apply enhanced
criteria, the Commission shall consider the cumulative impacts of the site
development plan.
(5) Stormwater management plan requirements.
(a) All stormwater management plans shall include measures to capture and
treat stormwater runoff in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the
most recent version of the Connecticut DEEP Stormwater Quality Manual
and to incorporate low-impact development design elements to the extent
that is practical.
(b) No application for a development involving any site development plan
will be approved by the Commission unless it includes a stormwater
management plan detailing how the stormwater runoff and associated
water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled
and managed during and after construction. The plan must be prepared by
an appropriate design professional.
(c) The Commission may impose additional requirements deemed reasonable
and necessary to control the volume, timing, rate and/or quality of runoff
if the hydrologic, geologic, topographic or land use conditions warrant
greater control than provided by the applicant. Further, the Commission
may restrict the use of certain BMPs and may require pretreatment to
exceed the minimum standards established in the most recent version of
the Connecticut DEEP Stormwater Quality Manual.
(6) Compliance with federal and state regulations. All stormwater facilities and
conveyance systems shall be designed in compliance with all applicable Town,
state and federal laws and regulations. It shall be the applicant's sole
responsibility to identify and obtain all required permits prior to the start of
any construction.
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:201
(7) Protection of public health, safety and general welfare. The design of
stormwater BMPs shall consider public health, safety and general welfare.
These considerations shall include, but not be limited to: preventing flooding
of buildings, structures and travelways; preventing long-term standing water
in and near drainage facilities; minimize the creation of mosquitoes' breeding
pools; preventing attractive nuisance conditions and dangerous conditions due
to stormwater depth or velocity and/or access to drainage structures, including
inlet and outlet openings. In addition, designs shall not result in the creation
of aesthetic nuisances due to excessive slopes, cuts and fills, lack of suitable
native landscaping and other similar conditions that would detract from the
appearance of the surrounding environment.
(8) Natural resource inventory.
(a) Stormwater management designs shall include an inventory of important
natural resources features on the site, and these features shall be shown
on the stormwater management plan. Protection and/or conservation of the
site's natural features shall be a part of the stormwater management plan.
(b) The plan shall identify important natural features identified through a
natural resources inventory that includes but shall not be limited to the
following: natural drainage features, riparian buffers, wetlands, steep
slopes, soils with high infiltration capacity, significant forest cover,
significant trees and natural communities, including the presence of any
threatened and/or endangered species.
(9) Site design feasibility report.
(a) Stormwater management practices for a site shall be selected on the basis
of the physical characteristics of the site. The design professional shall
submit a report outlining the stormwater practices options, including lowimpact
alternatives, that were considered and those that were chosen for
the design based on the evaluation and analysis of site opportunities and
constraints. Among the factors that should be considered:
[1] Depth to groundwater/ledge.
[2] Hydrologic functions.
[3] Contributing drainage area.
[4] Site vegetation.
[5] Soil characteristics.
[6] Topography.
[7] Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features.
(b) A soils report based on on-site boring logs or soil test pit data shall be
submitted with all designs. The number and location of soil borings/test pits
and associated soil testing shall be that which is necessary to determine
the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the
proposed stormwater measures as shown on the site development plan.
(10) Infiltration. All stormwater designs shall include infiltration for any new site
development unless the site design feasibility report and associated soils report
demonstrate that the physical characteristics of the site are not suitable. Lowimpact
design elements utilized for infiltration of discharge into a natural
system shall utilize native plant species.
(11) Overland flood routes.
(a) Overland flood-routing paths shall be provided to safely convey stormwater
runoff from the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour-duration storm event
§ 340-5.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.3
1:202
to receiving water resource or stormwater BMP with adequate hydraulic
capacity, such that the runoff is contained within a drainage easement
for the flood-routing path that does not cause flooding of buildings and
abutting properties.
(b) There shall be an allowance in all designs for a minimum of one foot of
freeboard for all flood-conveyance systems and flood-control structures.
(12) Stormwater conveyance. Stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed to:
(a) Maximize the flow path from inflow to outflow points;
(b) Include protection of inlet and outlet structures;
(c) Provide for the elimination of or protection from erosive velocities; and
(d) Utilize infiltration systems where applicable.
(13) Velocity dissipation. Devices and techniques to reduce stormwater velocities
and prevent erosion shall be placed at discharge outlet locations and along
or within the full length of any outlet channels to convey and discharge peak
design flows in a manner that will not result in scouring or surface erosion,
including receiving streams or channels or wetlands, so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions of the receiving waters
are maintained and protected.
(14) Landscaping/planting plan.
(a) All stormwater management designs shall include a detailed landscaping
plan that identifies the types (both common and botanical names),
locations, sizes and total number of all proposed plantings. Planting notes
and details shall also be provided as well as a maintenance and
management plan to ensure the long-term viability of all plantings. In
addition, the landscaping plan shall include a stabilization schedule for the
revegetation of all disturbed areas of the site. Any area of land from which
the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared
or removed by development activities shall be seeded with temporary
vegetation within seven days after the suspension of grading work which is
expected to last a period of 30 days or more. Permanent vegetation shall be
fully established by the date of substantial completion of construction.
(b) Following the first year after the establishment of permanent vegetation
and the completion of all landscaping plantings, an inspection shall be
conducted by the Town to confirm their health and survival. Should any
permanent vegetation or plantings be determined to be dead or dying
following the one-year period, then they shall be revegetated or replaced. A
second inspection shall then be conducted by the Town one year from any
subsequent revegetation or replanting.
(15) Nonstructural stormwater practices. To the extent that they are feasible, the
use of nonstructural stormwater treatment practices are required and shall
be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the most recent
version of the Connecticut DEEP Stormwater Quality Manual or other
appropriate low-impact design manuals acceptable to the Commission.
(16) Structural stormwater practices. All structural stormwater management
facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from
the most recent version of the Connecticut DEEP Stormwater Quality Manual.
For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Connecticut DEEP
Stormwater Quality Manual or for which pollutant removal rates have not
been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:203
must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means
acceptable to the Commission before approval of any design utilizing such
structural stormwater controls.
(17) Discharge to municipal stormwater system. If any stormwater runoff from a
new or modified site development plan is discharged to a municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) or other publicly, municipally or privately owned
storm sewer system, the applicant must demonstrate that the existing storm
sewer system has adequate excess hydraulic capacity to convey both increases
in peak discharge flow rates and in runoff volumes. In addition, all such
discharges shall conform to all the requirements contained in the applicable
general permit for the discharge of stormwater and dewatering wastewaters
from construction activities, the general permit for the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, or the general permit for the
discharge of stormwater associated with commercial activity, as originally
issued and reissued. All new or modified site development shall also conform
in all respects to the Town of Marlborough Illicit Discharge Detection and
Elimination Ordinance, as amended (Chapter 301, Article I, of the Town Code).
(18) Operation, inspection and maintenance plan agreement and schedule.
(a) An enforceable operation, inspection and maintenance plan agreement and
schedule shall be executed to ensure that the stormwater management
plan facilities function as designed and approved. The agreement shall
designate the responsible party for the long-term maintenance of the
approved stormwater management facilities and include a provision
passing the responsibility for such maintenance to successors in title. This
agreement shall include easements to the Town allowing access to all
stormwater management plan facilities at reasonable times for periodic
inspection by the Town and/or its agents to ensure that the facilities are
being properly maintained and in good working order. Said easements shall
be executed and recorded in the Marlborough Land Records with filing of
the final endorsed plan.
(b) The design and planning of all stormwater management plan facilities shall
include detailed inspection procedures and frequencies, maintenance plans
and schedules, as well as repair procedures to ensure their continued longterm
function. These items shall identify the components of the stormwater
management system that need to be inspected and maintained, provide
a maintenance schedule for each facility and the equipment necessary
to perform that maintenance. Provisions for the periodic review and
evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need
for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the
plan.
(c) All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at a minimum, an
annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Connecticut DEEP
Stormwater Quality Manual and any additional conditions assigned by
the Commission. Any maintenance and/or repair needs found must be
addressed in a timely manner by the owner and a reinspection made
confirming the completion of the identified items. The owner shall submit
to the Commission annually a copy of the inspection report and, if
necessary, any reinspection reports. If the responsible party fails or refuses
§ 340-5.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.3
1:204
to fully address all items identified in an inspection report after 30 days'
notice from the Commission of such failure to comply, the Commission shall
commence enforcement action to achieve compliance.
(19) Substantive changes to plan. No changes shall be made to an approved
stormwater management plan without review and written approval by Town
staff or if any such changes are determined to be substantive by the
Commission. Additional data may be requested to allow for a complete review
and evaluation of proposed changes to ensure compliance with the required
discharge standards.
L. Decision criteria.
(1) The Commission shall, when reviewing all site development plan applications,

and the use of low-impact development stormwater management best
practices.
(f) Due consideration to the Plan of Conservation and Development, as
amended.
(g) The design of the site, building, landscaping and other features are in
accordance with the criteria of Subsections D through J of this section.
M. Performance/maintenance bond.
(1) A performance bond shall be posted in an amount to be determined by the
Commission based on a review of Town staff recommendations for the current
construction costs of all proposed site improvements shown on the approved
site development plan and all sediment and erosion control measures, site
restoration, and landscape/planting plan improvements, plus a contingency
allowance of 20%. Posting of the performance bond and a bond agreement shall
be executed prior to the endorsement of the record plan and the commencement
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:205
of any construction activity. No bond will be released in whole or in part
for any portion of the stormwater management system until an as-built plan
demonstrating substantial conformance with the approved stormwater
management plan has been submitted and approved by the Commission.
(2) The bond shall be posted with the Town in accordance with the approved site
plan for an initial period of three years and include two one-year automatic
renewals. Copies of these bond forms can be obtained from the office of the
Planning and Development Director. The bond shall be in the form of a certified
check payable to the Town of Marlborough, a savings passbook with a signed
withdrawal slip for a joint account in the name of the Town and applicant,
or an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank maintaining offices in Hartford,
Middlesex, New London and/or Tolland Counties.
(3) A maintenance bond, equal to at least 20% of the amount of the original
performance bond amount, shall be held by the Commission for a period of
one year following the approval of the as-built plan. At the discretion of the
Commission, the maintenance bond period may be extended for an additional
one-year period due to poor vegetative growth, structural failures, or other
similar matters that impact the proper function and performance of stormwater
management facilities, survival of the landscaping, or other compliance with the
original approval.
N. Record drawings and bond release.
(1) Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and compliance and prior to
the release of the performance bond to a maintenance bond, the Commission
requires that one Mylar and two paper copies of the as-built record drawing are
submitted to the Commission for the finding of compliance with the approval
granted.
(2) On the finding of compliance of the original approval, the Commission will
sign the Mylar as-built record drawing, and the applicant shall record it at his
expense in the office of the Marlborough Town Clerk prior to issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.
O. Conditional approvals. If the application is approved with stipulations and/or
conditions, one Mylar and three paper copies of the revised plans and other
pertinent documents necessary to satisfy the conditions of approval shall be
submitted to, approved by and signed by the Commission within 90 days from the
date of the conditional approval. The Commission may grant, upon written request
of the applicant, a maximum of two ninety-day extensions. Any plan or permit not
approved and signed by the Commission within the required time frames shall
become null and void. Final approval shall be obtained at such time as the plans are
signed by the Commission.
P. Filing with the Town Clerk. Upon final approval, the approved site development plan
application, with the signed Mylar site development plan, shall be recorded by the
record landowner at his expense in the office of the Marlborough Town Clerk. Any
site development plan not so recorded within 90 days following the date of final
approval and signature by the Commission shall become null and void.
Q. Site plan becomes void.
(1) All work associated with the approved site development plan shall be completed
within three years from the date that the site development plan has been filed
with the Marlborough Town Clerk. The Commission may grant, upon written
request of the applicant, a maximum of two one-year extensions. In all cases, all
§ 340-5.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-5.3
1:206
work in connection with such site development plan shall be completed within
five years after the plan has been filed with the Marlborough Town Clerk.
(2) Failure to complete all work within such five-year period shall result in
automatic expiration of the approval of the site development plan. For the
purposes of this section of the chapter, "work" shall mean all physical
improvements required by the approved plan.
R. Conditional record drawing approval. During the period beginning December 1 and
ending April 1 or due to seasonal or weather-related conditions, the Commission
and the ZEO, where authorized, may at their discretion issue conditional as-built
record drawing approval where plantings, earth grading and seeding have not been
completed. The conditional as-built record drawing approval may be issued for a
period not to exceed 180 days. Upon written request by the applicant, completion of
the remaining site work and submission of the record drawing, the Commission may
release the remainder of the bond and the Chairman shall sign the record drawing.
S. Amendments. Construction and site improvements shall be completed in strict
compliance with the permit approved by the Commission. However, amendments to
an approved site plan may be made, provided that an application is submitted to and
approved by the ZEO or by the Commission as provided in this subsection. If the
ZEO determines that the construction or plan modifications are of a minor nature
and do not materially affect the permit, the ZEO may approve a set of modified site
plans and construction drawings. If the ZEO determines that the construction or
plan modifications are a significant amendment, the Commission may approve a set
of modified site plans and construction drawings.
T. Conditions for revocation. A site development plan may be subject to revocation
by the Commission, upon initiation of the process by the ZEO, if any condition or
safeguard imposed by the Commission upon land, buildings, structures and/or uses
for said site development plan are not strictly adhered to by the applicant and/or
landowner. The ZEO shall adhere to the procedures detailed in Article XV of this
chapter whenever a site development plan must be revoked.
U. Waiver of site plan requirements.
(1) In addition to uses and activities specifically exempted from site plan
requirements by this chapter, the Commission may waive requirements for a
site plan if it determines that a proposed activity will not affect existing traffic
circulation or result in an increase in the need for parking, nor will it entail any
significant exterior change to a building or site, nor will the new activity have
an impact substantially different from the existing use from which the change
is requested. A request for a waiver of site plan requirements will be submitted
in writing by the property owner or owner's agent at the time of application.
A Commission decision to waive site plan requirements may be made based on
informal discussion of the activity at a regular or special Commission meeting.
(2) Also, a partial waiver of site plan information requirements may be granted to
avoid unnecessary delay and expense for an applicant whose proposed activity
is minor in nature and limited in its impact on the surrounding area. The
Commission may, at its sole discretion, exempt any application from specific
information requirements as set forth in this section. The exemption may be
approved if the Commission finds that the information would not aid the
Commission in its determination of the application's compliance with this
chapter. A request for a partial waiver of site plan requirements will be
§ 340-5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-5.3
1:207
submitted in writing by the property owner or owner's agent at the time of
application.

X. Farm tourism uses. [Added 3-2-2017]
(1) Purpose. These regulations are intended to ensure that farm tourism
and the expansion of existing farm tourism uses are compatible
with the permitted uses in the surrounding area and contribute
to the unique community character and economic viability. These
regulations permit farm tourism as compatible accessory uses. It
is recognized that the magnitude of these accessory uses is often
greater than the uses that surround farms. The use or the
accumulation of farm tourism uses should be incidental and
subordinate to the use of the property for farming; they require the
greater level of regulatory scrutiny that is afforded under the special
permit. The purpose of farm tourism is to attract people to farms,
promote the sale of agricultural products using agriculture-related
tours, events and activities, as well as nonagricultural-related
activities. These tours, events, and other activities are to
supplement farm income. Activities include, but are not limited to,
petting farms, farm animal attraction, school tours, outdoor trails,
crop mazes, hayrides, pony rides, livestock and/or equine events,
group picnics, on-and-off-site food catering services, craft shows,
outdoor recreation, and educational activities. If a fee is charged, in
order to be a permitted use, the farm must be actively producing
agricultural products for sale. Farms where the seller is not actively
producing agricultural products for sale will require a special
permit.
(2) Qualifications. A special permit for a farm tourism use may be
granted, provided that:
§ 340-6.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-6.3
1:224
(a) The minimum lot area for farm tourism use shall not be less than
10 acres in a single parcel or combination of abutting parcels
under single ownership.
(b) As of the date of application for a special permit, no zoning
violation shall exist on the property. The applicant shall submit a
current certificate of zoning compliance.
(c) Regulation of farm stands and commercial greenhouses is
distinct from farm tourism and are permitted under the separate
permits in accordance with Article VI.
(3) Standards. To the extent that the Commission finds that each
standard does apply, a special permit for the farm tourism shall
not be granted unless the Commission also finds that the following
applicable standards have been met:
(a) Farm tourism use(s) shall have a direct supportive relationship
to the farming taking place on the farm; as a minimum, the farm
tourism use must provide an opportunity for sales of produce
from the on-site farming.
(b) The farm tourism use must utilize at least one produce item
produced on, or process from the product produced on the farm.
(c) Food preparation for events shall be limited to that which is
essential to the event (such as: pumpkin pie with a pumpkin
festival, vendor food with a fair) for which the application is
being made.
(d) Parking in accordance with Article XIII of these regulations.
(e) On the farm parcel(s), a vegetative buffer shall separate farm
tourism uses (e.g., pick-your-own fields, hiking trails and hay
wagon ride routes) from abutting nonfarming uses. A minimum
width of 15 feet on and/or off the farm property shall be
required. Where the buffer is to be off the farm property, a
permanent open space easement/dedication on or obtained from
abutting properties may be substituted for the on-site buffer,
the documentation for which shall be subject to approval by the
Commission.
(f) On the farm parcel(s), a vegetative and/or structural sound
buffer (e.g., sound deadening barriers or buildings) shall be
capable of eliminating noise outside farm tourism uses create
in any direction from any abutting property boundary. The
Commission may accept in lieu of a vegetative and/or structural
sound buffer, a report from a qualified sound engineer certifying
that the activity(s) being applied for is able to be conducted in
such a manner that the activity(s) shall comply with the State
of Connecticut DEEP noise standards with regard to maximum
decibel output (55 db daytime/45 db nighttime at least one foot
beyond the property line of the property on which the emitter is
located). The report shall describe the requirements necessary
for conducting the activity in order for it to comply.
(g) The minimum distance of any uses that generate smoke, heat or
ash shall be 75 feet from any property line.

§ 340-6.5. Open space conservation area regulation.
A. Authority. Pursuant to C.G.S. §§ 8-2, 8-18 and 8-25, the Marlborough Planning
Commission may approve cluster development in the form of an open space
conservation area residential development subdivision (O.S.C.A.R.), as provided
herein. The Marlborough Planning Commission may enact subdivision
regulations in furtherance of and not inconsistent with this chapter.
B. Purpose.
§ 340-6.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-6.5
1:231
(1) The purpose of this section is to provide for a flexible approach for design
and division of land for residential development while assuring that
significant natural and man-made resource areas within the Town will be
conserved and protected without increasing the overall residential density.
Specifically, this section is designed to further the following objectives:
(a) To promote design flexibility in residential development;
(b) To promote development that is sensitive to site characteristics;
(c) To preserve and provide land for open space, parkland and recreational
purposes which contribute to the health, safety and general welfare
of the residents of the Town of Marlborough. Such open space shall
preserve land that will serve one or more of the following purposes:
farmland, forestland, recreation areas, sensitive wetland and
watercourse systems, scenic vistas, geologic formations, unusual
topography, historic or prehistoric sites, wildlife areas and land that
contains rare or unusual flora or fauna;
(d) To encourage more creative and efficient site planning that will result
in reduced expenditures for utilities, infrastructure and maintenance
costs; and
(e) To achieve the objectives of the Open Space and Recreation Plan of the
Plan of Development.
(2) The granting of an approval for an O.S.C.A.R. subdivision shall be in the sole
discretion of the Marlborough Planning Commission to allow for reduced
requirements as to lot size, frontage, yardage, etc., in conformance with this
section.
C. Requirements.
(1) As a condition to approving an O.S.C.A.R. subdivision, the Planning
Commission shall find one or more of the following specific purposes to be
accomplished:
(a) To preserve land as unsubdivided common open space which will
preserve or enhance the appearance, character or natural beauty of the
area.
(b) To preserve land to serve as "common open space" needs.
(c) To preserve land for purposes of conserving natural resources.
(d) To inhibit building on poor soils.
(e) To preserve and protect particular areas and terrain having qualities of
natural beauty or historical interest.
(2) General eligibility requirements for an O.S.C.A.R. subdivision:
(a) O.S.C.A.R. subdivisions are limited to residential zones.
(b) O.S.C.A.R. subdivisions shall not result in the creation of more lots than
would occur in a conventional subdivision.
(c) O.S.C.A.R. subdivisions are limited to proposals resulting in five or more
lots.
(d) O.S.C.A.R. subdivisions shall provide for common or public open space
and/or conservation areas.
(3) Open space and development densities.
(a) "Open space," for the purposes of this chapter, is an area covered by
a development restriction. A development restriction prohibits further
development in order to preserve agricultural lands or any other land
that is predominately in its natural state. The Planning Commission, in
§ 340-6.5 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-6.5
1:232
its discretion, may permit noncommercial recreational uses permitted
by this chapter, provided that such uses are not inconsistent or harmful
to the preservation of the restricted area. The Planning Commission
may also permit activities and accessory structures necessary to
support open space agricultural uses.
(b) The maximum number of building lots shall not exceed the number that
would have been permitted in a conventional subdivision layout. As a
means to provide the applicant with some guidance in determining the
number of building lots permitted, the applicant is advised to utilize the
following formula:32
[1] By 80,000 square feet if the site will be serviced by individual on-site
wells and individual on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems.
[2] By 50,000 square feet if the site will be serviced by a community
water system and individual subsurface sewage disposal systems.
D. Design guidelines. In addition to such guidelines as may be contained in the
Marlborough Subdivision Regulations, the Planning Commission shall, in its
consideration of an O.S.C.A.R. subdivision, require that lots be laid out to the
greatest extent feasible to achieve the following objectives (listed below in
order of priority, as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any
given site):
(1) Preserve and maintain existing forests, fields, pastures and other land in
agricultural use and to preserve land mapped as Class I or II farmland soils
together with sufficient buffer areas of not less than 50 feet to minimize
conflict between residential and agricultural use.
(2) Diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building design shall be
encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development
and the land. Consideration shall be given to the preservation, creation and
connection of wildlife corridors and trails within subdivision open space.
(3) Provide for pedestrian access between properties and for a perimeter
design concept intended to facilitate the networking of trails for pedestrian
or equine use to ensure recreational access to resource land as provided for
in the Subdivision Regulations.
(4) The permanent open space area shall be primarily located in areas
contiguous to existing open space areas or in an area of the site with the
highest probability of connecting with future open space areas.
(5) Leave unblocked or uninterrupted scenic views and vistas, particularly as
seen from public roads.
(6) Preserve historic and prehistoric sites and their environments insofar as
needed to protect the character of the site.
(7) Maintain the visual integrity of hilltops and ridgelines by siting development
so that building silhouettes will be below the ridgeline or hilltops or, if the
area is heavily wooded, the building silhouette will be at least 10 feet lower
than the average canopy height of trees on the ridge or hilltop.
E. O.S.C.A.R. height, area and yard requirements.

§ 340-6.6. Floating zones.
A. Intent. The purpose of this section is to allow flexibility in development
to permit multiple principal residential buildings on a single parcel in
order to provide for housing:
(1) That promotes design flexibility in residential development.
(2) That promotes housing for persons who, due to age or health,
require more compact residential patterns than possible through
single-lot subdivisions.
(3) Encourages more creative and efficient site planning that will
reduce site disturbance and the amount of infrastructure necessary.
(4) That allows recreation uses while preserving open space.
B. Floating zones.
(1) Any owner of property may apply to the Commission for a change of
zone to one of the following floating zones, provided said application
conforms in all respects with the requirements set forth in this
article for such zone change: Design Multiple Residence - DMR,
Planned Residential Recreational Development - PRRD, and Adult
Living Development - ALD. For each such zone change approved
by the Commission, the provisions of Article VI of this chapter
shall not apply to said floating zone, and in their place the plans,
specifications, conditions, representations and other components
of the zone change application, as approved and/or modified and
approved by the Commission, shall control in said floating zone.
(2) For the purposes of this article, the term "underlying zone" shall
be defined as the zone or district existing on the subject parcel(s)
prior to the filing of an application for a floating zone and the
zone to which said floating zone shall revert after approval if said
floating zone is not developed within the time limit established by
this article.
C. Preapplication procedure.
§ 340-6.5 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-6.6
1:234

the Commission for the purpose of presenting a preliminary design
of the proposed development to the community at an early stage
in the design process and to incorporate applicable comments and
suggestions into the overall design.
(2) At a minimum, the preliminary site development plan shall include
enough detail to measure for the requirements of this chapter and
to clearly present the proposal. This preliminary plan shall be
submitted with five copies of the plans, a description of the proposed
uses and plans that include:
(a) Application fee. In accordance with the Town Land Use Fee
Ordinance.
(b) General statement. A general statement shall be submitted,
describing the following:
[1] The specific types of proposed uses on the site;
[2] The methods by which site utilities will be provided;
[3] The proposed timetable for development, including a
description of phasing;
[4] The open space resources of the site and the amount of open
space to be retained, and the method for preservation, if
any;

Development.
(c) Site plan. Any application for a floating zone shall provide the
Commission with all the information required under Article V,
§ 340-5.2 of this chapter.
(d) Additional information. A change of zone application calls upon
the Commission to exercise a legislative function and to
determine that the floating zone applied will be superior to the
underlying zoning in achieving the purposes of this chapter as
set forth in Article I.
D. Referral to Planning Commission. The Commission shall refer all
applications to the Planning Commission in the manner provided by
C.G.S. § 8-3(a), as amended from time to time, for its study of the

§ 340-6.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-6.6
1:243
M. Conformance to recorded documents. The land described shall be used
and developed only in accordance with the recorded documents.
N. Amendment of approved floating zone. An application to alter or extend
an approved floating zone or previously approved DMR (Designed
Multiple Residence) application shall specify the nature of the planned
alterations and/or extensions and shall be accompanied by a scale plan
of the alterations and extensions in the same detail as is required for
an initial application. Such application shall be processed in the same
manner as a new application under this article.
O. Commencement and completion of construction. For any floating zone
approved, the construction of any buildings or structures or the
establishment of any use shall be completed within three years of the
effective date of such approval. The applicant may request up to two
one-year extensions from the Commission; in no case shall completion
extend past five years from the original effective approval date. Any
such approval not commenced or completed within the above time
frame shall become void, and the Commission shall call the bond to
complete the incomplete work. The Commission shall file a notice on the
Land Records stating the approval has been voided for all incomplete
work.
P. Performance bond.

construction in connection with an approved floating zone, that
the applicant post a bond with surety and amount satisfactory to
the Commission and Town Counsel to insure conformance with all
proposed site improvements as depicted on the final site
development plan. Site improvements include construction of
streets and parking areas, landscaping, lighting, drainage, water
supply, septic disposal, sidewalks and the like. The applicant shall
submit an itemized cost breakdown for all site improvements to
Town staff for review and approval to determine the final bond
amount. The final bond amount as determined by Town staff shall
include a fifteen-percent contingency. If the project is proposed
in phases, the Commission may permit each phase to be bonded
separately. No phase may commence construction until a bond has
been posted for such phase.
(2) The bond form shall either be cash, certified bank check, an
irrevocable letter of credit from a Town-approved banking
institution, or an assigned joint account passbook from a Townapproved
banking institution with a signed withdrawal slip from the

improvements have been installed.
R. Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued
until the application of the binder coat of asphalt and complete utility
installation for that phase of construction. Additionally, the applicant is
to submit three sets of the as-built plan. In those cases where seasonal
conditions prevent compliance with the provisions of the approval
before the building is complete, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may
authorize issuance of the certificate of occupancy after the submission
of an as-built plan showing all site improvements completed to date. All
bonded incomplete work shall be completed within a time frame that
does not exceed one year from the date of issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for that particular phase of construction and a final as-built
plan submitted to the Commission for approval prior to release of the
performance bond. Failure to complete the incomplete work within the
specified time frame will result in the calling of the bond and may be
cause for revocation of the floating zone.
§ 340-6.7. Large lot conservation subdivision.
A. Purpose. To allow the development of parcels 30 acres and larger in
a way that will allow a flexible approach to the subdivision of large
residentially zoned parcels while assuring that significant natural and
man-made resource areas within these large parcels will be conserved
and protected. Specifically, this section is designed to further the
following objectives:
(1) To promote design flexibility in residential land development;
(2) To promote development that is sensitive to site characteristics;
(3) To preserve and provide land for open space, parkland and
recreational purposes which contribute to the health, safety and
general welfare of the residents of the Town of Marlborough. Such
open space shall preserve land that will serve one or more of the
following purposes: farmland, forestland, recreation areas, sensitive
wetland and watercourse systems, scenic vistas, geologic
formations, unusual topography, historic or prehistoric sites, wildlife
areas and land that contains rare or unusual flora or fauna;
(4) To encourage more creative and efficient site planning that will
result in reduced expenditures for utilities, infrastructure and
maintenance costs;
(5) To achieve the objectives of the Open Space and Recreation Plan and
the Plan of Conservation and Development.
B. Large lot conservation subdivision plan standards.
(1) Minimum parcel size: 30 acres.
(2) Minimum lot size: four acres/160,000 square feet.
(3) Open space area: 50%.
(4) The minimum buildable lot area requirement is waived.
(5) Up to three interior lots may abut one another only if there is use of
a common driveway to service the lots.
(6) Common driveways can be constructed in the minimum required
side yard after approval by the Planning Commission.
§ 340-6.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-6.7
1:245
(7) Along street frontage, a common driveway that services no more
than two street front lots and four interior lots is permitted.
(8) No cul-de-sac in a large lot conservation subdivision plan shall be
greater than 1,200 feet.
(9) An applicant is not entitled to the maximum development density
permitted by this section. The maximum density will be determined
by the Planning Commission in evaluating the application for
compliance with the purpose and objectives of this section and
compliance with the Subdivision Regulations.
(10) A large lot conservation subdivision may be utilized in combination
with an O.S.C.A.R. subdivision, but not in combination with a
conventional subdivision. The open space area requirement will be
increased to 60% when the combination of an O.S.C.A.R. and large
lot conservation are utilized.
(11) All large lot conservation subdivision plan developments shall be
considered a subdivision, by definition, subject to all of the
procedural and plan requirements of the Highway Construction and
Design Standards.
(12) Except where otherwise provided in this section, all of the
standards of the Subdivision and Zoning Regulations shall be
satisfied.
C. Large lot conservation subdivision plan requirements.
(1) As a result of the exemption from the minimum buildable lot area
requirements and the large lot sizes permitted, building location and
site design become critical elements in ensuring compliance with
the conservation and preservation intent of this chapter. Therefore,
the location of all individual driveways, dwelling units, subsurface
sewage systems and wells shall be shown on the subdivision plan
and become a part of the application approval. Construction will be
limited to those designated areas.
(2) In addition to such guidelines as may be contained in the
Marlborough Subdivision Regulations, the Planning Commission
shall, in its consideration of a large lot subdivision, require that lots
be laid out to the greatest extent feasible to achieve the following
objectives (listed below in order of priority, as it is recognized that
some may conflict with others on any given site):
(a) Preserve and maintain existing forests, fields, pastures and other
land in agricultural use and to preserve land mapped as Class I
or II farmland soils together with sufficient buffer areas of not
less than 50 feet to minimize conflict between residential and
agricultural use.
(b) Diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building
design to achieve the best possible relationship between
development and the land.
(c) There shall be the creation of contiguous open space corridors
through the use of conservation easements and dedicated open
space land.
§ 340-6.7 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-6.7
1:246
(d) The permanent open space areas shall be in accordance with
Article VI of this chapter and the Open Space and Recreation
Plan and the Plan of Conservation and Development.
(e) Provide for pedestrian access between properties and for a
perimeter design concept intended to facilitate the networking of
trails for pedestrian or equine use with other existing or future
open space land to ensure recreational access to the public for
resource land as provided for in the Subdivision Regulations.
(f) Leave unblocked or uninterrupted scenic views and vistas,
particularly as seen from public roads.
(g) Community wells and community septic systems may be
permitted to encompass no more than 30% of the open space
area.
(h) The visual integrity of hilltops and ridgelines shall be maintained
by siting development so that building silhouettes will be below
the ridgeline or, if the area is heavily wooded, the building
silhouettes will be at least 10 feet lower than the average canopy
height of the trees on the ridgeline or hilltop.
(i) Road cut/fills exceeding 45 feet, as measured from the center
line of the proposed road, shall submit a landscape plan for the
restoration of disturbance beyond the snow shell area.
(j) Submission of a justification for the use of common driveways
versus roads shall be submitted in developing large lot
conservation subdivision plans.
(k) Low-impact development practices shall be utilized in design.

ARTICLE IX
Village Center District Regulations
[Amended 5-5-2011, effective 6-4-2011]
§ 340-9.1. Purpose.
The purposes of the Village Center District (VCD) are to:
A. Promote the Village Center as the economic and civic hub of
Marlborough.
B. Encourage mixed-use, compact and unified land development.
C. Create a pedestrian-friendly environment, while providing convenient
access to businesses.
D. Provide for a variety of housing types at higher densities than allowed in
other districts.
E. Establish developments that evoke the feeling of a traditional New
England village in design and architecture.
§ 340-9.2. Principles.
All development in the VCD shall be designed to comply with the following
principles:
A. Properties will be developed in such a way as to reduce the dominance
of motor vehicles. A new street network within the Village Center will
reduce highway orientation and promote traditional neighborhood-style
development.
B. Properties within the VCD will be linked to encourage physical activity
and social interaction. A sidewalk system will extend throughout the
Village Center District, and greenways along natural resource corridors
will be created.
C. Development will protect important natural resources, especially surface
water and groundwater. All stormwater will be managed in accordance
with best management practices and the Connecticut DEEP Water
Quality Manual to minimize contamination risks.
D. Buildings will be placed at or close to the edge of sidewalks and will
provide pedestrian-scaled facades at street level to encourage walking.
A mixture of uses will be provided within and among buildings to further
promote pedestrian activity.
E. Development will be coordinated to the greatest extent feasible to
promote a unified form. Collaboration on development proposals will be
encouraged, and infrastructure and streetscape improvements will be
coordinated.
F. Architecture will emphasize doorways, windows at street level, facade
details and articulation at a scale that enhances the pedestrian
environment.
§ 340-9.3. Subdistricts.
In order to organize land uses into neighborhood-type development, the
VCD is further divided into the following subdistricts, each of which shall
§ 340-9.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-9.3
1:259
be deemed to be a zoning district but governed by those provisions of this
chapter that are applicable to all Village Center Districts:
A. VCDZ 1 - Commercial Core. This subdistrict serves as the commercial
center of the village, and therefore allows the greatest mix of uses while
enhancing those sites and uses to the greatest extent feasible.
B. VCDZ 2 - Commercial Center. This subdistrict is intended to allow for the
expansion of commercial uses in a scale and form that is compatible with
existing uses.
C. VCDZ 3 - Limited Institutional. This subdistrict encompasses the current
Town Hall and a medical facility and is intended to continue to support
institutional uses appropriately scaled to existing conditions.
D. VCDZ 4 - Institutional. This subdistrict is intended for public institutional
uses of a scale and nature that are compatible with existing institutions,
including the elementary school, library, senior center and
Congregational Church.
E. VCDZ 5 - Residential. This subdistrict is intended to encourage
residential development at a density that will help to support the
adjacent commercial center and core and not typically allowed
elsewhere in Marlborough.
§ 340-9.4. Permitted uses.
A. Permitted uses in VCDZs are shown in Table 1, Permitted Uses. Any
permitted use in the VCDZ shall require special permit approval, as
specified in § 340-5.1 of this chapter. In VCDZ 1 and VCDZ 2, mixed uses
are permitted.
B. When the Commission approves a special permit use in any VCDZ, there
shall be no change of any such use to a different use without further review
in accordance with Article V of this chapter.
C. Accessory uses are permitted in conjunction with the issuance of a special
permit for the principal use, but only to the extent of the type, size and
character of such accessory uses as may be specified in the special permit
application and any amendment thereto.

standards in Subsection E.) This buffer strip is also intended to
accommodate site amenities, including items such as pedestrian
streetlights, furniture, bike racks, waste receptacles and other
similar items, which shall be generally consistent in design and
materials throughout the Village Center District and in accordance
with the Marlborough Town Center Stylebook, as may be amended.
Developers are encouraged to provide appropriate amenities.
D. Buildings.
(1) Design. Buildings should be designed in the scale, size and quality of
a traditional New England village. They must have a visual continuity
with adjacent buildings that reflect such traditional designs and
should be designed and use materials in accordance with the
Marlborough Town Center Stylebook, as may be amended.
(2) Facades. Buildings more than 60 feet in length shall be segmented
into a series of smaller elements to avoid long unbroken facades.
Distinct elements shall be achieved through a change in color,
§ 340-9.7 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-9.7
1:264
material or texture and a projection, recess, window, balcony, trellis
or similar architectural feature. Two-story buildings must include
upper-story articulation to reduce the bulky appearance of the
structure.
(3) Windows.
(a) In order to provide visual interest and pedestrian activity,
ground-floor facades that face principal arterials or collector
streets shall be primarily transparent. Not more than six
horizontal feet of wall facing principal arterials or collector
streets shall be without a transparent window or door. A
minimum of 50% of principal arterial or collector street-facing
ground-floor facades, consisting of transparent entranceways,
display windows, or windows from two to eight feet in height,
is strongly encouraged. The bottom edge of such windows or
display windows may not be more than three feet above the
adjacent sidewalk.
(b) All glass in doors and windows shall appear transparent. A
minimum amount of tinting to achieve sun control is acceptable,
provided the glass appears transparent from the outside.
(4) Entrances. Primary entrances shall be highlighted by architectural
elements, lighting and signage. The design should enhance the
relationship between the building and sidewalk and emphasize the
pedestrian scale.
(5) Building services. Mechanical equipment shall be incorporated into
the design of the structure and not visible from the public view.
Loading docks, dumpster areas, and other building service facilities
shall be incorporated into the architecture of the building and
screened from public view.
E. Landscaping.
(1) Intent. The intent of this provision is to preserve and/or improve
the natural character of the Village Center District, especially offstreet
parking areas and yard areas of commercial and mixed-use
developments. Landscaping requirements are meant to achieve the
following goals:
(a) To provide natural visual screening of parking areas and along
property boundaries between zoning districts to preserve the
existing visual quality of adjacent lands.
(b) To reduce surface runoff and minimize soil erosion through the
natural filtering capability of landscaped areas.
(c) To provide natural buffers that reduce glare and noise.
(d) To moderate any adverse impacts of parking areas by providing
shade, absorbing reflected heat from paved surfaces and
creating natural windbreaks.
(e) To enhance the overall visual quality of new development by
providing a variety of plant materials that are consistent and
compatible with the existing natural vegetation of the area.
(2) Street trees. Wherever feasible, existing street trees shall be
retained and incorporated into the street design.
§ 340-9.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-9.7
1:265
(a) Spacing. Street trees are required on all existing and new
streets. Street trees shall not be spaced less than 45 feet apart.
Consideration shall be made for driveways, streetlights, utility
poles, underground utilities, traffic-light poles and other
obstructions. Consideration shall also be made for future
placement of trees in front of adjacent properties.
(b) Soils. Street trees planted near sidewalks shall require structural
soils to help prevent root disturbance.
(c) Species. Acceptable street tree species are provided in the
Marlborough Town Center Stylebook, as may be amended.
(3) Parking lot landscaping.
(a) Low-impact development techniques, such as, but not limited to,
depressed, infiltrating, landscaped islands are encouraged.
(b) Shade tree species, with a minimum caliper of four inches, shall
be planted in and around parking lots to reduce heating of paved
surfaces.
(c) A variety of native New England species shrubs, ground covers
and perennials shall be provided in parking lot islands.
(4) Stonewalls. Stonewalls shall be used in place of, or in combination
with, fencing along boundary lines that can be viewed from the
public right-of-way.
(5) Hanging baskets, planters and window boxes. Planters shall not
obstruct sight distances at street intersections or ingresses or
egresses. Planters shall not encroach into the sidewalk so that less
than five feet of passageway is available for pedestrians. Window
boxes should be at least as wide as the window sill where they are
located. They shall not encroach into the sidewalk. Hanging baskets,
planters and window boxes shall contain live plantings.
§ 340-9.8. Floating zone.
Intent. In recognition of the desire for larger buildings for certain
commercial uses, this section is intended to allow for such buildings under
certain conditions in order to serve the community's needs while
maintaining and enhancing the Village Center character.
A. Floating zone.
(1) Any owner of property in the VCDZ 1 that does front a principal
arterial, as defined in the Plan of Conservation and Development,
may apply to the Commission for a change of zone to the Village
Center Planned Commercial Floating Zone (VCPC Floating Zone).
For each such zone change approved by the Commission, the
provisions of this Article IX applicable to the VCDZ 1 shall remain
in effect, except § 340-9.6A shall not apply to said floating zone.
In its place, the following standards, in addition to the plans,
specifications, conditions, representations and other components of
the zone change application and its accompanying master plan, as
approved and/or modified and approved by the Commission, shall
control in said VCPC Floating Zone.
(2) For the purposes of this article, the term "underlying zone" shall
be defined as the zone or district existing on the subject parcel(s)
§ 340-9.7 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-9.8
1:266
prior to the filing of an application for a floating zone, and the
zone to which said floating zone shall revert after approval if said
floating zone is not developed within the time limit established by
this article.
B. Preapplication procedure.
(1) All prospective applicants considering development within the VCPC
Floating Zone are encouraged to review with the Planning and
Zoning Commission, on an informal and preapplication basis, a draft
preliminary master plan and drafts of other information required
by this chapter. Although this process may enable a prospective
applicant to obtain meaningful preliminary feedback, this informal
review is not intended to include evaluation of application specifics.
(2) Neither the preapplication conference nor the formal consideration
of the preliminary plan shall be deemed to constitute any portion of
the official and formal procedure of applying for a change of zone
or a land use concept plan approval. Neither the proponent nor the
Commission shall be in any way bound by statements made in such
informal discussions, their purpose being only to minimize delay,
expense and inconvenience to the public, the proponent and the
Commission upon the future receipt, if any, of a formal application
for a VCPC Floating Zone. Similarly, silence by Commission
members during an informal review should not be construed as
assent or acceptance of what is presented. Following any informal
discussion, the Commission may suggest that the proposal, or
certain aspects thereof, be referred to other municipal, state or
federal agencies for review and comment, or may suggest that
additional information is or will be required prior to action on a
formal application for change of zone. All applicants shall submit
a preliminary site development plan to the Commission for the
purpose of presenting a preliminary design of the proposed
development to the community at an early stage in the design
process and to incorporate the applicable comments and
suggestions into the overall design.
(3) Information included.
(a) At a minimum, the preliminary site development plan shall
include enough detail to measure for the requirements of this
chapter and to clearly present the proposal.
(b) This preliminary plan shall be submitted with five copies of the
plans, a description of the proposed uses and plans that include:
general statement. A general statement shall be submitted

1:269
(s) Identification of any known natural and/or cultural resources
(i.e., stonewalls, foundations, archeological sites, etc.).
(4) Sanitary sewers and public water.
(a) Sanitary sewers.
[1] The applicant shall submit an impact analysis prepared by
a professional engineer that evaluates the proposed sanitary
wastewater flow of the development on the public sewer
system concerning the impact to the system's capacity and
capability of effluent from the development, with discharge
standards set by the Marlborough Water Pollution Control
Authority. The applicant shall submit a report from the
Marlborough Water Pollution Control Authority prior to the
close of the public hearing for any application.
[2] If the applicant has to construct any sanitary sewer facilities
that Marlborough Water Pollution Control Authority will not
own and/or operate, the applicant shall submit information
concerning the ownership, operation and maintenance as a
part of the application submittal.
[3] If the applicant proposes to construct a community sewerage
system, as defined in C.G.S. § 7-245, being any sanitary
sewer facilities that the Marlborough Water Pollution
Control Authority will not own and/or operate, the applicant
shall submit information concerning the ownership,
operation and maintenance as a part of the application
submittal. In addition, a report from the Marlborough Water
Pollution Control Authority, indicating that all requirements
of C.G.S. § 7-246f have been satisfied, shall be provided.
(b) Public water. Documentation shall include but not be limited
to engineering feasibility studies of the proposed water supply
(such as well data from existing wells on or near the site. Final
engineering design, final governmental approvals, or physical
construction of water supply facilities shall not be required at
the zone change and master plan approval stage, but shall be
required prior to the issuance of any special permit in
accordance with Article V of this chapter.
(5) Additional information. A change of zone application calls upon the
Commission to exercise a legislative function and to determine that
the floating zone applied will be superior to the underlying zoning
to achieve the purposes of this chapter as set forth in Article I.
Therefore, it is incumbent on the applicant to provide sufficient
information, in both detail and scope, to meet its burden of proof in
that regard. Further, it is the obligation of the applicant to provide
any additional information which the Commission may request or
require in order to make such a determination. Such information
may include, but is not limited to: information concerning
surrounding land uses, building locations, driveways, streets,
topography, watercourses and wetlands, utilities and the like; a
traffic impact study prepared by a Connecticut-registered
professional engineer qualified to prepare such studies; an
§ 340-9.8 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-9.8
1:270
environmental impact statement prepared by professionals qualified
to prepare such studies; detailed architectural information, such as
color samples, screening of roof- or ground-mounted heating and airconditioning
equipment and ventilation ducts, building illumination,
samples of construction materials and the like; detailed landscaping
plans, including the type, size, number and location of material to be
planted, the location and construction material of any fences, walls,
flagpoles, street furniture, walkways, trash disposal areas and the
like; reports from its own consultants and staff or from government
agencies.
(6) Referral to Planning Commission. The Commission shall refer all
applications to the Planning Commission in the manner provided
by C.G.S. § 8-3(a), as amended from time to time, for its study
of the proposed use and construction and its conformance to the
plans and policies of the Marlborough Plan of Conservation and
Development. The Planning Commission shall issue a report in the
manner provided by C.G.S. § 8-3(a), as amended from time to time.
An application receiving a negative report from the Planning
Commission may be approved by the Zoning Commission by a vote
of not less than 2/3 of the full Commission.
D. Height, area and yard requirements.
(1) Lot size: minimum 20,000 square feet.
(2) Lot frontage: minimum 100 feet.
(3) Required yard.
(a) Front yard: maximum 20 feet from the edge of sidewalk. The
Commission may waive this requirement if architectural
renderings or models of the existing and proposed streetscape
for the project and surrounding properties are presented which
clearly show a public benefit to the alternative building
placement being proposed.
(b) Side yards: minimum 15 feet.
(c) Rear yard: minimum 25 feet.
(d) Building separation: minimum 20 feet.
(4) Ground-floor area: maximum 40,000 square feet per building.
(5) Impervious surface coverage: maximum 60%. The Commission may
allow up to 70% for mixed-use developments or mixed-use buildings
that share parking areas between all uses. Pervious surfaces are
encouraged and shall count at a rate of 40% of their area towards
maximum lot coverage.
(6) Height: maximum 35 feet. Cupolas, chimneys, stair towers and other
vertical architectural elements may exceed the maximum height,
provided such elements are integral to the building design and are
in proportional scale with the buildings to which such features are
affixed.
E. Public hearings and actions.
(1) The Commission shall act in such manner and in accordance with
such time limits as are designated for changes of zone in accordance
with Article XVI of this chapter and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General Statutes. In the event of conflict
§ 340-9.8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-9.8
1:271
between the procedure set forth in this chapter and the Connecticut
General Statutes, the latter shall prevail.
(2) As an exercise of its legislative authority, the Commission may
approve, approve with modifications, or deny any application to
amend the Zoning Map to VCPC Floating Zone. The Commission
may also require that certain amenities, such as improved or natural
open space areas or community facilities, be allocated to particular
phases of the development so as to ensure that such amenities
proceed apace with the other components of the development. The
Commission may also require that each phase contain a minimum
number or type of uses to assure that the initial phases, standing
alone, will further the purposes of the VCPC Floating Zone as set
forth in this Article IX, and may require that certain buildings or
certain uses within a phase receive building permits and be under
construction before future phases may commence construction. In
considering any petition to amend the Zoning Map to VCPC Floating
Zone, the Commission shall determine the master plan and all other
application materials are consistent with the standards and
purposes of a VCPC Floating Zone set forth in this section and, in
addition, with those criteria set forth in § 340-5.3 of this chapter that
are applicable to the master plan level of detail. This reference to
Article V shall not be construed to require plans or other materials
at that level of detail required for a special permit application at the
zone change and master plan approval stage.
F. Approval.
(1) Upon approval of a VCPC Floating Zone, the Commission shall
provide notice to the applicant and the public as provided by the
C.G.S. and shall cause the approved floating zone to be noted on the
Official Zoning Map of the Town of Marlborough by outlining the
boundaries of the land affected thereby and indicating the approval
date.
(2) The applicant shall, within 90 days of approval of any VCPC Floating
Zone, record notice thereof in the Marlborough Land Records under
the name of the record owner of land affected thereby, giving legal
description of the land and giving specific reference to approved
plan(s) and map(s); and, further, the applicant shall record in the
Marlborough Land Records a copy of the approved plan(s) and
map(s) endorsed by the signature of the Commission's Chairperson
or Secretary. The applicant may request from the Commission up to
two ninety-day extensions of the filing period noted above.
G. Conformance to recorded documents. The land described shall be used
and developed only in accordance with the recorded documents.
H. Amendment of approved VCPC Floating Zone. An application to alter or
extend an approved VCPC Floating Zone or previously approved DMR
(Designed Multiple Residence) application shall specify the nature of
the planned alterations and/or extensions and shall be accompanied by
a scale plan of the alterations and extensions in the same detail as is
required for an initial application. Such application shall be processed
in the same manner as a new application under this article. The
§ 340-9.8 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-9.8
1:272
Commission may waive any of the application requirements contained
in this section in the event of minor modifications for which such
requirements are not necessary in the opinion of the Zoning Commission
to adequately review and decide the application for modification.
I. Commencement and completion of construction. For any VCPC Floating
Zone approved, the construction of any buildings or structures or the
establishment of any use shall be completed within three years of the
effective date of such approval. The applicant may request up to two
one-year extensions from the Commission; in no case shall completion
extend past five years from the original effective approval date. Any
such approval not commenced or completed within the above time frame
shall, following notice and an opportunity to be heard by the applicant
and owner, become void, and the Commission may call the bond to
complete the incomplete work. The Commission shall file a notice on the
Land Records, stating the approval has been voided for all incomplete
work.
J. Performance bond.
(1) The Commission shall require, prior to the commencement of any
construction in connection with an approved VCPC Floating Zone,
that the applicant post a bond with surety and amount satisfactory
to the Commission and Town Counsel to insure conformance with
all proposed site improvements as depicted on the final site
development plan. Site improvements include construction of streets
and parking areas, landscaping, lighting, drainage, water supply,
septic disposal, sidewalks and the like. The applicant shall submit
an itemized cost breakdown for all site improvements to Town staff
for review and approval to determine the final bond amount. The
final bond amount, as determined by Town staff, shall include a
fifteen-percent contingency. If the project is proposed in phases, the
Commission may permit each phase to be bonded separately. No
phase may commence construction until a bond has been posted for
such phase.
(2) The bond form shall either be cash, certified bank check, an
irrevocable letter of credit from a Town-approved banking
institution, or an assigned joint account passbook from a Townapproved
banking institution with a signed withdrawal slip from the
applicant. The Commission shall not release more than 75% of the
original bond amount until all work is complete.
(3) All bonds shall be for a three-year period, and any irrevocable letter
of credit shall contain a ninety-day notice of nonrenewal. The
applicant may request an extension of the bonding period from the
Commission, not to exceed a period past five years from the original
date of approval.
K. Maintenance bond. The Commission shall require the applicant to post
a bond for a period not to exceed one year from the date of completion
of certain site improvements, depending on the time of year such
improvements have been installed, in order to assure the repair or
replacement of damaged or defective site improvements.
L. Certificate of occupancy.
§ 340-9.8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-9.8
1:273
(1) No certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued until the
application of the binder coat of asphalt and complete utility
installation for that phase of construction. Additionally, the applicant
is to submit three sets of the as-built plan. In those cases where
seasonal conditions prevent compliance with the provisions of the
approval before the building is complete, the Zoning Enforcement
Officer may authorize issuance of the certificate of zoning
compliance after the submission of an as-built plan showing all site
improvements complete to date.
(2) All bonded incomplete work shall be completed within a time frame
that does not exceed one year from the date of issuance of the
certificate of occupancy for that particular phase of construction
and a final as-built plan submitted to the Commission for approval,
prior to release of the performance bond. Failure to complete the
incomplete work within the specified time frame will result in the
calling of the bond and may be cause for revocation of the VCPC
Floating Zone.
§ 340-9.9. Relationship to zoning regulations; special permit review.
A. Master plan prevails. Unless provided otherwise in this Article IX, uses
within the VCPC Floating Zone shall be subject to all provisions and
definitions of this chapter. However, because the intent of the VCPC
Floating Zone is to provide flexibility in design standards in order to
achieve important design objectives as described herein, in cases of
conflict with other provisions of this chapter, including the zoning
definitions, the provisions of this Article IX shall prevail. Unless
expressly prescribed by this Article IX, all uses, dimensional,
architectural, bulk, location, landscaping, parking and lighting
requirements for a VCPC Floating Zone shall be established by the
Commission in its sole legislative discretion as part of an approved
master plan for that zone, and the Commission may apply as written or
may vary to meet the purposes of the VCPC Floating Zone all particular
requirements of this chapter pertaining thereto. The foregoing
notwithstanding, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent
review under the requirements and criteria of Article V of this chapter
for any special permit application which review addresses a level of
detail for that special permit application which was not addressed in
the approval of the VCPC Floating Zone and its accompanying master
plan and studies. Similarly, nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent such review for any elements of the special permit that
differ from the approved master plan. The intent of this section is that
any compliance issues which can be addressed at the level of detail
afforded by the master plan shall not be revisited in the individual special
permit applications filed in compliance with such master plan, while not
precluding the Commission from examining the more detailed plans of
the special permit application in conformance with the criteria of this
chapter that are appropriate to such detailed level of review.
B. Special permit review. Following approval of an VCPC Floating Zone,
all applications for special permit approval for the structures and other
§ 340-9.8 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-9.9
1:274
improvements within such plan shall be filed with the Commission
pursuant to the following process:
(1) Informal review. All applicants are encouraged to review all special
permit applications with the Land Use Administrator on an informal
basis prior to the filing of any application.
(2) Application process.
(a) Applications for special permit approval in an VCPC Floating
Zone must be filed with the Commission and conform to Article
V of this chapter, except as provided otherwise in this Article IX.
Each proposed use, site plan, building or structure, and other
component of the application shall include all structures and
other improvements within the entire master plan or within a
project phase as approved by the Commission as part of its
approval of the master plan and shall substantially conform to
such master plan.
(b) The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any
application for special permit approval in accordance with the
provisions of Article V.
(c) If any of the activities proposed in the special permit application
are regulated by the Marlborough Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Agency (IWA)33 by authority granted by the
Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission shall not render a
decision on the application until the IWA has rendered a decision
on the application to conduct such regulated activities.
(3) Application requirements. All applicants for special permit approval
shall provide the application materials required by Article V. The
following additional information shall also be submitted:
(a) Dedications to Town. Identification of all land and improvements
intended to be dedicated to the Town of Marlborough.
(b) Statement of consistency with plans, studies and guidelines. A
statement shall be provided demonstrating reasonable
consistency with the following documents that were approved as
part of the VCPC Floating Zone map amendment and identifying
any deviations from the master plan and the reasons for such
deviations.
(c) Permanent maintenance plan. The applicant shall submit a
permanent maintenance plan that establishes a yearly
maintenance plan which establishes a schedule of maintenance
activities to ensure the aesthetic quality and cleanliness of the
site. The maintenance plan shall include, but not be limited to,
a timetable for all maintenance activities with respect to private
storm drainage systems, utilities and other infrastructure,
including, but not limited to, landscaping and screening, roads,
parking areas, sidewalks, trails and berms, lighting, signage,
storage, refuse and litter control, snow removal and other site
amenities proposed in the plans. If the development is intended
to be a common-interest-ownership community pursuant to the
Common Interest Ownership Act (the "Act"),34 the applicant shall
submit proposed language to be included in the declaration of
§ 340-9.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-9.9
1:275
the community under the Act, binding each unit owner and the
unit owners' association to the requirements of the approved
maintenance plan. If the development is intended to be
something other than a common-ownership community, the
applicant shall submit a restrictive covenant and easement
document which details maintenance responsibilities or another
sufficient legal document which stipulates maintenance
covenants and easement arrangements to the satisfaction of the
Commission.
(4) Approval considerations. In reviewing any proposed special permit,
the Commission shall determine the following:
(a) That the application is consistent with the criteria set forth in
Article V, except as provided in the following subsection.
(b) That the application is reasonably consistent with the master
plan and accompanying documents; and that the potable water
and effluent disposal facilities described in § 340-9.8C(4) will be
operational prior to the use or occupancy of any land, building
or structure. A determination of reasonable consistency with the
master plan shall constitute a conclusive presumption that the
use, the location of a building, the square footage, height and
size of a building, and the density of any residential use are
in compliance with the criteria of Article V. If in its judgment
the Commission determines that changes have been made to the
master plan, including without limitation the size, density, mix of
uses, site layout, appearance and/or design of the development
that affect the application's fulfillment of the objectives of a
VCPC Floating Zone, the application may be found not
reasonably consistent with the master plan, which shall require
the filing of an amendment to the master plan.
(c) That all other applicable provisions of the Marlborough Zoning
Regulations in this chapter have been satisfied, except as
otherwise provided by this section and the master plan approved
in accordance herewith.
(5) Approval conditions. The Commission may approve, or approve with
modifications, or deny any proposed special permit in order to
achieve compliance with the master plan or the purposes of this
article.

defined below by asterisks, as long as the parking requirements, sanitation
requirements, and building and fire code requirements, etc., can be met and
the exterior site plan is not changed. Such changes in use need approval
from the Zoning Enforcement Official (ZEO). In the event the ZEO
determines that the applicable requirements, regulations or other issues
within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Commission are not satisfied by the
change in use, the only appeal of that determination shall be via application
for a special permit for such change in use.

F. General sign guidelines and standards.
(1) Size standards.
(a) Except as set forth in this Subsection F(1), no sign shall exceed the
permitted size for such type of sign and zoning district in which such sign
shall be located. By way of clarification, if no permitted size is prescribed for
a type of sign in a zoning district, the permitted size shall be deemed to be
zero square feet, and such sign shall not be erected, installed or otherwise
placed on any lot, except as otherwise permitted by this Subsection F(1).
(b) The Zoning Enforcement Officer, or any Town employee working under the
direction of the Zoning Enforcement Officer and exercising the duties of
the Zoning Enforcement Officer hereunder, may issue a zoning permit to
allow for a sign to exceed the permitted size for such type of sign and
zoning district in which such sign shall be located, provided that in no event
shall any such zoning permit be issued for a sign in excess of the zoning
permit size for such type of sign and zoning district in which such sign
shall be located. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or other Town employee
shall issue such zoning permit only after verifying that such proposed sign
complies with all guidelines, standards and provisions contained within this
§ 340-13.1.
(c) The Zoning Commission may issue a special permit to allow for a sign to
exceed the zoning permit size for such type of sign and zoning district in
which such sign shall be located, provided that in no event shall any such
special permit be issued for a sign in excess of the maximum size for such
§ 340-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.1
1:307
type of sign and zoning district in which such sign shall be located. The
Zoning Commission shall issue such special permit only after verifying that
such proposed sign complies with all guidelines, standards and provisions
contained within this § 340-13.1, and shall be issued only if the unique
characteristics of a lot and a proposed sign require.
(d) The size of any sign shall be measured in accordance with the measurement
standards set forth in this § 340-13.1.
(2) Measurement standards.
(a) Sign measurement shall be based upon individual letters or symbols
individually affixed to a surface, building, wall, window, or sign surface.
The area shall be considered to be that of the smallest rectangle which
encompasses all of the letters and symbols.
(b) For a sign consisting of individual letters or symbols individually affixed to
a surface, building, wall, or window, the area shall be considered to be that
of the smallest rectangle which encompasses all of the letters and symbols.
(c) The area of supporting framework (e.g., brackets, posts, etc.) shall not be
included in the area if such framework is incidental to the display.
(d) If a sign has two faces but is deemed to be one single sign pursuant to the
terms of this § 340-13.1, the sign area shall be taken as the area of either
face, and if the faces are unequal, the larger shall determine the area.
(3) Measurement of height. The height of any sign shall be measured from the
surface of the nearest public road up to the highest point of the sign. In
situations where a sign is intended to be visible from two roads of different
elevations, measurement shall be from the surface of the lower roadway.
(4) General placement standards.
(a) No sign shall be placed in such position as to endanger traffic on a street
or public way by obscuring a clear view, by creating confusion with official
street signs or signals or by creating an unnecessary and unsafe distraction.
(b) No sign, other than official street or highway signs, shall be erected or
maintained within the street or highway right-of-way.
(c) No sign shall be attached to any tree or utility pole, or be permitted to be
painted directly upon the roof of any building.
(d) No sign shall be located within 15 feet of any other sign on the same lot,
and no sign located on a frontage lot line shall be placed within 100 feet of
any other sign located on the same frontage lot line. The Commission, upon
application of an owner or tenant, may issue a special permit to allow such
person or entity in a mutlitenant building to place on the building with three
or more tenants canopy or wall signs located closer than 15 feet.
(e) All detached signs, directory signs, political signs, public interest signs,
temporary event signs, and temporary real estate signs shall be placed
along a frontage lot line, and each sign shall, to the extent possible, be
placed as close to such frontage lot line as permitted by this § 340-13.1.
(5) Safety standards.
(a) Except for contractor's signs and temporary event signs, all signs shall be
designed to be immovable and structurally attached and secured to the
ground, a building or another sign.
(b) No person shall erect a sign which is structurally unsafe, as determined by
the Building Official or the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
§ 340-13.1 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-13.1
1:308
(c) Signs which constitute a hazard to public safety and health by reason
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment shall not be
permitted, and each owner shall promptly remove or repair any such sign
existing on such owner's lot. All signs shall be maintained so as to present
a neat, clean appearance. Painted areas shall be kept in a safe, neat and
clean appearance and in good structural condition, and illumination shall
be maintained in good working order. Signs that are no longer safe, neat,
clean or in sound structural condition must be repaired or removed. Signs
which are no longer functional or advertising establishments that have been
abandoned or are no longer active shall be promptly removed or relocated
by the owner of the lot on which such sign stands.
(d) Signs which obstruct free entrance or exit from a door, window or fire
escape shall not be permitted.
(e) Signs which obstruct light or air or interfere with the proper functioning of
a building shall not be permitted.
(f) Upon the removal of any sign, the owner shall promptly restore the lot or
any structure thereon to the original condition of such lot or structure.
(6) Design guidelines and standards.
(a) The size of any awning sign, detached sign, directory sign, public interest
sign, roof sign, temporary event sign, wall sign or window sign shall be
restricted to ensure that signs do not overpower the buildings and facades
on such lot or neighboring lots.
(b) Lettering shall be of the style, size and color necessary to be legible to
the general public and aesthetically compatible with the character of the
neighborhood and Town, and all such lettering shall be simple and readable.
(c) The size of a sign shall not exceed the size necessary to be legible to
the general public and aesthetically compatible with the character of the
neighborhood and Town. The Zoning Commission hereby finds that the
maximum sizes permitted for many types of signs in various zoning districts
are unreasonably large in most applications, and such maximum sizes
should only be used in unique circumstances, such as for signs which are
substantially set back from a public road.
(d) Signs shall not cover unique or special architectural details, such as, but not
limited to, arches, sills, moldings, cornices, and transom windows.
(e) Materials used to construct and support signs should be selected to
enhance the Town and the property on which the sign will be located.
Examples of acceptable materials which may achieve this result include,
without limitation, carved wood, carved stone, gold leaf and their visual
equivalents.
(f) All of the same type of signs on a lot shall express a uniformity in scale,
style, design and placement of signs to create a sense of consistent
appearance, and all store units located at the same property shall
complement and be aesthetically compatible with one another.
(g) Restraint should be exercised when selecting colors. Colors should be
chosen to complement and not clash with the facade color of the building
and the aesthetic value of the neighborhood and the Town.
G. Prohibited signs. In furtherance of the provisions of Subsections B(2), C(2), D(2)
and E(2), but without limitation, the following signs shall be prohibited in all zones
within the Town:
§ 340-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.1
1:309
(1) Streamers, pennants, ribbons, spinners or other similar devices.
(2) Internally illuminated signs, flashing signs, neon signs, inflatable signs, and
signs containing reflective elements, which sparkle or twinkle.
(3) Signs advertising or identifying a business or organization which is either
defunct or no longer located on the premises.
(4) Off-premises signs.
(5) Any vehicle or trailer exhibiting any lettering or symbols and parked in such a
manner as to indicate that such vehicle is being used for the basic purpose of
advertising products sold, or directing people to a business or activity located
on or near the place where such vehicle is parked.
(6) Three-dimensional signs built to physically represent the object advertised.
(7) Signs which utilize supporting framework (e.g., brackets, posts, etc.) exceeding
20% of the sign area as measured pursuant to the terms of this § 340-13.1.
(8) Signs which are not expressly permitted in these regulations.
H. Application procedures and requirements.

district in which such sign shall be located as described in Subsection F(1)(a),
no person shall erect, alter or relocate any sign without first obtaining a permit
from the Zoning Commission.
(2) With respect to any application for a zoning permit or special permit to allow

or attachment, including complete measurements of all dimensions of such
method of support.
(d) A graphic rendering of the sign, its placement and the surrounding location,

location, height, size, type, illumination, structural materials and overall design
and appearance.
I. Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) Noncommercial signs. Notwithstanding any other provision in this § 340-13.1 or
these regulations to the contrary, any sign authorized in these regulations may

permit size; c) a modification to the illumination standards and restrictions
contained herein; d) the general placement standards set forth herein; e) the
safety standards set forth herein; or f) the design guidelines and standards set
forth herein. The issuance of any variance by the Marlborough Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not waive the applicant's requirement to obtain a permit from the
Zoning Commission in accordance with this § 340-13.1.
(3) Severability. The provisions contained in this § 340-13.1 are declared severable,
to the maximum extent permissible by law. If any provision or provisions of

invalid or unlawful, it is the intent of the Zoning Commission that said invalidity
shall not affect other provisions of these regulations, which shall remain in full
force and effect as if such portions so declared invalid or unlawful were not
originally part of this § 340-13.1, even if the surviving parts of this § 340-13.1
result in greater restrictions after any unlawful provisions are stricken. In
particular, and without limitation, in the event any portion of this § 340-13.1
is declared invalid as applied to noncommercial signs, this § 340-13.1, or any
surviving portions thereof, shall remain in full force and effect.

in the State of Connecticut shall be submitted to and approved by the
Commission.
A. General requirements.
(1) The plan shall identify existing and proposed trees, shrubs, ground
cover, and features such as rock outcroppings or stonewalls. The
plan shall show where the landscaping elements are and will be
located, shall indicate the size and species, and shall include the

provide at least four inches of even cover to all disturbed areas of
the development and shall be stabilized by seeding, planting or other
acceptable techniques.
(3) Maximum effort shall be made to save and retain existing vegetation,
trees or stonewalls. To this end, no material, temporary soil deposits
or construction shall take place within four feet of shrubs and within
15 feet of trees to be retained. Protective barriers and/or tree wells
shall be installed around plants to be retained. Existing, healthy,
mature trees may be considered in meeting the requirements of this
chapter.
(4) Any landscaping element shown on an approved site development
plan, and which shall be in a condition that does not satisfy the intent
of this chapter, shall be replaced by the property owner.
(5) All landscaping in parking areas and on street frontage shall be
placed so that it will not obstruct sight distance.
(6) Refuse collection areas, utilities, loading and unloading areas shall
be screened around their perimeter by a buffer strip and shall be
located so as to minimize visibility from all streets.
§ 340-13.2 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-13.3
1:314
(7) When security or screening fences are required or necessary for
the operation and maintenance of certain permitted uses, the
Commission may require that such fences are adequately screened
from public view.
(8) All outdoor refuse collection, storage and unloading areas shall be
enclosed by a wall or fence, shall be equipped with a self-closing
spring-loaded gate, shall be located at least 25 feet from all buildings
and may be viewed as a fire hazard as per C.G.S. § 29-306, as

facility may protrude above the height of such screening.
B. Parking area landscaping requirements.
(1) A minimum of 10% of the total parking site within the parking
perimeter shall consist of a landscaped permeable surface(s).
(2) All parking areas shall be planted with at least one tree for every

addition, these areas shall be planted with grass, shrubs and other
vegetation. The Commission recommends the use of a variety of the
following trees: Chinese dogwood, Flowering ash, Crimean linden,

For any use not specified herein, sufficient parking spaces shall be provided to the
standards of the most similar use specified in this chapter as determined by the
Commission. Mixed-use development parking requirements shall be the sum of the
parking requirements for the various uses, except where a reduction of parking spaces
is allowed by this section.
H. Maximum parking allowance. The Commission may approve parking lots with more
spaces than allowed, provided all of the spaces above the allowance number are
composed of a pervious surface and where adequate stormwater management is
provided. Also, the Commission may approve parking lots above the allowance
requirements where pervious surface treatment is not environmentally sound and
where a stormwater management system plan can demonstrate zero post-development
increase in peak discharge and that water quality discharge standards are met. The
maximum number of additional parking spaces that the Commission may permit is 25%
for impervious parking surfaces and 50% for pervious parking surfaces.
I. Parking space held on reserve.
(1) The Commission may permit a twenty-five-percent reduction in the construction of
the required on-site parking as long as the applicant can demonstrate he can meet
all the parking requirements and the proposed uses will not require the utilization
of all the parking spaces. If a reduction is granted, the site plan shall delineate
reserved parking spaces for future parking if it becomes necessary.
(2) In a phased development plan, areas designated as reserve parking for future
parking areas based on phasing must be clearly depicted on the phased
development site plan. The terms and conditions of the construction phasing of the
§ 340-13.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.5
1:325
buildings and parking area completion must clearly be set forth in notations on the
approved site plan.
(3) Such reserve parking areas must be kept planted and maintained rather than
surfaced for parking until such time as the additional parking space is necessary.
Further, no aboveground improvements shall be placed or constructed upon such
reserve parking areas.
J. Change in use or modification to existing structures. When the use of any building,
structure or premises is changed or expanded, resulting in an increase of more than
10% in the required number of off-street parking spaces, additional off-street parking
shall be provided consistent with parking requirements and standards of this chapter.
K. Spaces near obstructions. When the side of a parking space abuts a wall, column or
other obstruction that is taller than six inches, the width of the parking space shall be
increased by two on the obstructed side.41
L. Drive- through. Drive-through facilities may only be accessory to an allowable main
use. The use of drive-through facilities is limited to banks, pharmacies, or food service
establishments that meet the requirements below. [Amended 12-7-2017]
(1) The facility shall not be located between the building and the street, except on a
corner lot.
(2) The stacking area shall be located so that the area for five cars is located before
their reaching the service window.
(a) Stacking spaces shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width and 18 feet in length,
and shall be designed so as not to impede on- and off-site traffic movements
and sight distances at intersections.
(b) Stacking lanes shall be separated from other on-site parking and circulation
lanes by a raised median, planting area, or other acceptable method to ensure
the adequate channeling and safety of traffic movements.
(3) The principal pedestrian access to the building shall not cross the drive-through
lane.
(4) Hours of operation. When the drive-through facility use (i.e., menu board) is
located on a site within 100 feet of any residential dwelling, hours of operation for
the drive-up/drive-through service shall be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily.
If the drive-through facility use is located greater than 100 feet from a residential
dwelling, the hours of operation shall be limited to 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight.
(5) Each drive-through entrance/exit shall be at least 50 feet from an intersection of
public rights-of-way, measured at the closest intersecting curbs, and at least 25
feet from the curb cut on an adjacent property. Exceptions may be granted by the
designated approving authority when drive-through pull-out spaces are provided.
(6) Noise. Any drive-up or drive-through speaker system shall emit no more than
50 decibels, and at no time shall any speaker system be audible above daytime
ambient noise levels beyond the property lines of the site. The system shall be
designed to compensate for ambient noise levels in the immediate area.
(7) Drive-through lanes shall not be located adjacent to outdoor patio or eating areas.
(8) Menu boards. Menu boards shall not exceed 24 square feet in area, with a
maximum height of six feet, and shall face away from public rights-of-way. Outdoor
speakers shall be located at least 50 feet from any residentially zoned/occupied
parcel.

§ 340-13.5 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-13.5
1:326
(9) Minimum floor area for restaurants. To ensure that the drive-through service
facility is an accessory to a primary restaurant use, the minimum interior floor
area for drive-through restaurants shall be 1,000 gross square feet.
(10) Minimum site or part of center or development complex. A restaurant with drivethrough
facilities shall have a minimum one-acre land area or shall be part of a
commercial center or larger development complex of at least one acre.
M. Reduction in parking space for mixed-use development. For a mixed-use development
of land, the Commission may allow the following parking space reductions, at the
applicant's request:
(1) Up to 30% of the parking spaces required for the predominant use on a site may be
shared with other uses operating during the same time of day and days of the week.
The predominant use is considered to be that which requires the most parking of
those sharing the parking facilities.
(2) Up to 75% of parking spaces required for uses such as theaters (movie and live),
public auditoriums, bowling alleys, nightclubs, movie theaters, and similar
predominately evening uses may be shared with such uses as banks, offices and
similar predominately daytime uses.
(3) Up to 75% of the parking spaces required for such uses as houses of worship and
other uses exclusively in operation during the weekend may be shared with such
uses as medical offices, banks and other similar uses predominately in operation on
weekdays.
(4) Up to 50% of parking spaces required where there is a duly executed and recorded
shared parking agreement over an area that exceeds 5,000 square feet of parking
area.
N. Landscaping requirements.
(1) Purpose and applicability.
(a) The purposes of the parking lot landscape standards are to reduce the
environmental and visual impact of parking areas and the associated
impervious surface. Parking lot landscaping design shall, through the use of
native trees, shrubs and ground cover and other landscape design elements:
[1] Screen the views of parking areas from the street and adjoining properties.
[2] Reduce thermal impacts of stormwater runoff through canopy cover and
site design.
[3] Filter/retain stormwater runoff through the capture of 75% or more of the
first flush (first half inch) of stormwater runoff from impervious areas.
[4] Segment parking areas to no more than 10 spaces utilizing landscape
elements.
[5] Accommodate bicyclist and pedestrian movement through the parking area.
(b) These landscaping requirements shall apply to all new parking areas. For
existing parking areas that expand greater than 5,000 square feet, the whole
parking area shall provide interior and perimeter landscape plantings.
(2) Plant selection. All design shall only utilize a variety of native tree and plant species,
no planting material identified as an invasive species by the State of Connecticut
DEEP shall be utilized. No one species shall compromise more than 50% of the
plantings for the particular planting area. Bushes, shrubs and ground cover plant
materials must be in sufficient quantity and size so that within five years from
planting complete coverage of the area is achieved. Tree species selection shall
take into account that the canopy coverage of the impervious surface shall be
75% within 10 years; therefore, trees selected shall provide shade canopies with
§ 340-13.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.5
1:327
a minimum diameter of 10 feet at maturity. Temporary mulches are required in all
planting areas until full plant coverage is achieved. A minimum of one shade tree
for each five spaces of provided parking shall be required.
(3) Plant protection. Areas containing plant materials shall be protected from vehicle
damage and allow for a pedestrian crossing area outside the planted area. Vehicles
may overhang the landscape area no more than 18 inches. All plant materials
shall be maintained free from physical damage or injury arising from lack of
water, chemical damage, insects and diseases. A root barrier or equivalent shall be
installed per manufacturer's specifications for all trees within 10 feet of a paved
area or sidewalk. Plant materials showing such damage shall be replaced by the
same or similar species. Planting areas shall be kept free from weeds, debris and

§ 340-13.11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.11
1:345
Towers that will provide service for two telecommunications carriers
shall not exceed the height of 150 feet. The Commission, upon
written request from the applicant, may grant additional tower
height up to 180 feet to accommodate future sharing when the
Commission finds such a request would not create a greater
negative visual impact on the community than a lower tower height
at the particular location and consideration of the following criteria
are met:
(a) A letter of intent for co-location from at least two other carriers.
(b) A location not directly abutting or in the R Zoning District.
(c) A location within the highway right-of-way of CT Route 2.
(d) A location on the Town Transfer Station property.
(2) Height of wireless facility other than tower structure.
(a) Requirements.
[1] Height, side- and roof-mounted facilities. Side- and roofmounted
personal wireless service facilities shall not project
more than 10 feet above the height of the existing building
or any building located on the same or abutting property nor
project more than 10 feet above the height limit permitted
in the zoning district that the property is located.
[2] Height, existing structures. New antennas located on any
of the following structures, such as water towers, guyed
towers, lattice towers, fire towers church steeples, and
cupolas, shall be exempt from the height restrictions of
the zoning district where located, provided that there is no
increase in height of the existing structure as a result of the
installation of the personal wireless service facility.
[3] Height, existing public utility structures. New antennas
located on electric transmission lines and distribution
towers, telephone poles and similar existing utility
structures may project an additional 20 feet above the
existing structure.
(b) Height exceptions. If any applicant desires a height greater than
permitted above, he may apply to the Commission for a special
permit to increase the height.
(3) No repeater shall be closer than 200 feet to a dwelling unit
measured at ground level nor less than 35 feet above the ground.
(4) Telecommunications tower setbacks. Where guy wire supports are
used, setbacks will begin at the base of the guy wire anchored to the
ground, not at the base of the tower. No tower shall be built:
(a) Within 1/2 times the height of the proposed tower horizontally
to any structure existing at the time of application which is used
as a primary or secondary residence or the structure of primary
use and assembly located on nonresidential property; no closer
than 750 feet to the property of any school (both public and
private), church or to any other public building or athletic fields.
Primary or secondary residences are those dwelling units that
include toilet facilities and facilities for food preparation and
sleeping.

1:346
(b) Within 1 1/2 times the height of the tower horizontally to any
boundary line of the property under which the tower(s) or
facilities are located, except this restriction may be waived when
the adjoining property is owned by the same owner(s) as the
tower site. In this case the owner(s) shall place an easement
restricting the construction of any expansion of existing
buildings/structures or the construction of new buildings/
structures on the property within the tower fall zone setback
area as long as the tower exists. Also, the Commission may
allow the fall zones to extend within a neighboring property if
it finds that a substantially better design will result from such
a reduction. Such neighboring property shall be subject to an
easement, secured by the applicant, preventing the erection of
any structures within the fall zone area during the time the
tower is in place.
(c) Within the habitat of any state-listed rare or endangered wildlife
or species and a minimum of 150 feet from the perimeter of the
habitat area.
(5) Building(s)/ground equipment setbacks. All buildings housing
ground equipment or mounted ground equipment shall be set back
a minimum of 50 feet from all abutting property lines and may
be located within the fall zone. The Commission may increase this
setback for generators, depending upon their noise emission.
L. Monitoring and evaluation of compliance.
(1) Basic requirements.
(a) Pretesting. After the granting of a special permit and before
the facility begins transmission, the applicant shall pay for an
independent consultant RF engineer, chosen jointly with the
Commission, to monitor the background levels of EMF radiation
around the proposed facility site and at appropriate distances
from it and/or at any repeater locations to be utilized for the
applicant's wireless facilities. A report of the monitoring results
shall be prepared by the independent consultant and submitted
to the Zoning Commission.
(b) Any major modification of an existing facility or the activation of
any additional permitted channels shall require new monitoring.
(c) The Commission may request the applicant to perform testing
to verify that the emissions from the tower facility are in
compliance with all permits issued. Such a request for testing
shall not be made more than every two years. The applicant shall
have 35 days from the date of receipt of the request to perform
such testing and submit the results to the Commission. Failure
to comply will be considered a violation of the special permit.
(2) Excessive emissions.
(a) Should the monitoring of a facility site reveal that the site
exceeds the current FCC standards and guidelines, then the
owner(s) of all facilities utilizing the site shall be notified. In
accordance with FCC requirements, the owner(s) must
immediately reduce power or cease operation as necessary to
§ 340-13.11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-13.11
1:347
protect persons having access to the site, tower or antennas.
In addition, the owner(s) shall submit to the Commission an
analysis of what caused the problem and a plan for the reduction
of emissions to a level that complies with the FCC standards
within 10 business days of noncompliance.
(b) Failure to accomplish this reduction of emissions within 15
business days of initial notification of noncompliance shall be a
zoning violation subject to fines and such other remedies as are
otherwise available to the Town, Commission or ZEO pursuant
to Connecticut General Statutes. If a violation does occur, the
Commission can request a maximum of four random testings for
a one-year period after the correction of the violation.
(3) Structural inspection. Tower owner(s) shall pay for an independent
State of Connecticut-registered professional structural engineer to
conduct inspections of the tower and all its appurtenances for their
structural integrity and safety. Guyed towers shall be inspected
every three years. Monopoles and nonguyed lattice towers shall
be inspected every five years. A report of the inspection results
shall be prepared by the independent consultant and submitted to
the Marlborough Zoning Commission. Any major modification of an
existing facility which includes changes to the tower dimensions or
antenna numbers or type shall require a new structural inspection.
(4) Unsafe structure. Should the inspection of any tower reveal any
structural defect(s) which, in the opinion of the independent
consultant, renders that tower unsafe, the following actions must be
taken: within 10 business days of notification of unsafe structure,
the owner(s) of the tower shall submit a plan to remediate the
structural defect(s) to the Building Official for approval; the
corrections shall be completed within 10 business days of the
submission of the remediation plan; failure to accomplish this
remediation of structural defect(s) within 10 business days of initial
notification shall be a zoning violation subject to fines. Such fines
shall be payable by the owner(s) of the tower until compliance is
achieved.
M. Abandonment and discontinuation of use.
(1) Any telecommunications facility which ceases to operate for six
consecutive months shall be deemed to be abandoned and removed
within 90 days. "Cease to operate" is defined as not performing the
normal functions associated with a telecommunications facility and
its equipment on a continuous and ongoing basis for a period of six
consecutive months.
(2) Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, who shall have the right to request
documentation and/or affidavits from the telecommunications tower
owner/operator/service provider(s) regarding the subject of tower
usage. Failure or refusal for any reason by the owner/operator/
service provider(s) to respond within 20 days to such a request shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the communications tower has
been abandoned. Upon a determination of abandonment and notice
§ 340-13.11 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-13.11
1:348
thereof to the owner/operator/service provider(s), the owner(s) and
all others listed as responsible parties shall remove the tower and
all facilities and remediate the site within 90 days. At the time
of removal, the facility site shall be remediated such that all
telecommunications facility improvements which have ceased to be
utilized are removed. If all facilities on a tower have ceased to
operate, the tower shall also be removed and the site shall be
revegetated. Existing trees shall only be removed if necessary to
complete the required removal. Applicant shall, as a condition of
the special use permit, provide a financial surety bond payable to
the Town of Marlborough and acceptable to the Commission to
cover the cost of removal of the telecommunications facility and the
remediation of the landscape should the facility cease to operate.
Any special permit granted for the facility will automatically expire.
N. Bonding. As a condition of approval of a special permit, the applicant
shall provide a separate demolition bond in an amount determined and
approved by the Commission. The bond shall be for duration and in
a form and manner of surety as determined by the Commission, with
provision for inspections and Town removal of facilities in the event of
failure to perform by the responsible parties.
O. Duty to remove. The following are considered jointly and severally to be
the responsible parties for wireless telecommunications tower and other
wireless facility removal and site remediation:

ridgelines and where their visual impact is least detrimental to
highly rated scenic areas, such as, but not limited to, those sites
designated as scenic in the Marlborough Plan of Development.
In determining whether or not a tower will have an undue
adverse visual impact on the scenic or natural beauty of a ridge
or hillside, the Commission shall consider, but not be limited to:

features;
[3] Background features in the line of sight to the proposed
tower that obscure the facility or make it more conspicuous;
[4] The distance of the proposed tower from the viewing
vantage point and the proportion of the facility that is visible
above the skyline;
[5] The number of vehicles traveling on a public highway or
waterway at or near the critical vantage point;
[6] The sensitivity or unique value of the particular view
affected by the proposed development;
[7] Devaluation of property.

ARTICLE XIV
Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses of Land and Structures
§ 340-14.1. Statement of intent.
A. Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, or amendments
that may later be adopted, there shall exist lots, structures and uses of
land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this chapter or future amendments.
B. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the zoning districts involved. It is further the intent of this
chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended if such a change increases the nonconformity or is used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same zoning district.
C. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or
a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises
or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited
generally in the zoning district involved. Nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans if construction was lawfully
begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter.
§ 340-14.2. Nonconforming lots of record.
A. In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter,
a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption
of amendments of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or lot frontage, or both,
that are generally applicable in the zoning district, provided that yard
dimensions and other requirements not involving area or frontage, or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the zoning district
in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the ZBA.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the future construction of
structures in conformance at the effective date of this chapter in
subdivisions in the process of approval at such effective date or in
subdivision approved prior to such effective date.
§ 340-14.3. Nonconforming uses of land.
Where at the effective date of adoption of amendments of this chapter
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
§ 340-14.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-14.3
1:357
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
C. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases to exist for a period of one
year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this chapter for the zoning district in which such land is
located unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the ZEO
that the owner's intent was not to abandon such use.
§ 340-14.4. Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure containing a permitted use exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under
the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the
lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
A. Should such structure be destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion or
act of God it may be repaired or replaced to its original dimensions
existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction. If such repair
or replacement is not begun within one year from the date of such
damage or destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall be made to conform to the regulations for the zoning
district in which it is located after it is moved.
C. Such nonconforming structures shall not be structurally altered,
reconstructed or expanded unless such alterations or expansions
conform to all applicable setback, building height, coverage and use
requirements, or are alterations required by law. In addition,
maintenance and repair work required to keep a nonconforming
structure in sound condition shall also be permitted.
D. In accordance with the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes
§ 8-13a, when a building is so situated on a lot that it violates this
chapter with respect to its relation to the boundaries of the lot, and such
building has been so situated for three years without the institution of
an action by the administrative official to enforce such regulations, such
building shall be deemed a nonconforming building in relation to such
boundaries. Although the structure may become legally nonconforming
with respect to its relationship to the boundaries of the lot, it shall not
become legally nonconforming with respect to any other provisions of
this chapter, uses of land, structures, or both, which were not legally
established prior to this chapter or in conformance with this chapter, and
shall not become legally nonconforming by the passage of time.
§ 340-14.3 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 340-14.5
1:358
§ 340-14.5. Nonconforming uses of structures.
If a lawful use of a structure, or a structure and lot in combination, exists at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not
be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the zoning district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered in a manner
which increases the nonconformity except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located.
B. Any structure or structure and lot in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such structure
is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
C. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and lot in
combination, ceases to exist for one year, the structure and premises in
combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located unless the owner
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the ZEO that the owner's intent was
not to abandon such a use.
§ 340-14.6. Repairs and maintenance.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order
of such official.

to have given a municipal citation until such violation has been
cured to the satisfaction of the ZEO and/or the Commission. The
amount of such fine and such daily accrual shall be equal to the
amount established by the Board of Selectmen from time to time
pursuant to the Citation Ordinance.47 The enforcement officers are
hereby empowered to issue municipal citations to any violation party,
provided no municipal citation shall be given to any violation party
unless and until: a) a cease and desist order has been given; b)
either the minimum period to appeal such cease and desist order
as provided in this chapter has lapsed without appeal being made,
or such violation party has made timely appeal to the Zoning Board
of Appeals, which appeal was subsequently denied by said Zoning
Board of Appeals; and c) the Commission has given its authorization
for such enforcement officer to give such municipal citation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any enforcement officer may give
a municipal citation contemporaneously with the giving of a cease
and desist order for any significant violation, and the Commission's
authorization shall be deemed automatically given therefor.

ARTICLE I
Introduction
§ 410-1. Findings and purpose.
A. The Town of Marlborough (the "Town"), through the Marlborough Water
Pollution Control Authority ("the MWPCA"), is the owner and operator
of a public sewer; and does not own, operate or have located within
the territorial limits of the Town any arrangements or devices for the
treatment of sewage and sludge; and has entered into a written contract
with the Colchester/East Hampton Joint Facilities and the Town of East
Hampton Water Pollution Control Authority whereby and wherein each
party has agreed to accept, treat and discharge the flow of sewage
from certain parts of the Town's public sewer into and out of the Water
Pollution Control Facility owned, operated and maintained by
Colchester/East Hampton Joint Facilities.
B. These regulations establish the procedures for making connections and
use of the public sewer in the Town. They also establish specific limits for
septic flows and pollutant discharges which by their nature or by their
interaction with sewage will be detrimental to the public health, cause
damage to the public sewer or the water pollution control facility, pollute
the waters of the State, or otherwise create a public nuisance. Further,
these regulations pertain to the sewer avoidance area of the Town.
C. These regulations are intended to:
(1) Inform the public as to the technical and administrative procedures
to be followed in obtaining connection to the public sewer system;
(2) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the public sewer system
which will interfere with the collection and/or treatment system;
(3) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment system
which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into the
waters of the state, or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;
(4) Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system;
(5) Ensure the proper operation of on-site septic systems outside the
sewer service areas in conjunction with the Chatham Health District.
D. These regulations authorize the issuance of wastewater discharge
permits; provide for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
establish administrative review procedures; require user reporting; and
provide for the setting of fees for the reasonable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.
E. These regulations shall apply to the Town and to persons outside the
Town who contribute flow to the public sewer system. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the Town, through the MWPCA and its
officers, agents, employees and persons bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall implement and enforce the provisions of these
regulations.
§ 410-2. Water pollution control plan.
§ 410-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-2
1:373
A. Purpose and authority. In accordance with Chapter 103, and particularly
C.G.S. § 7-246, the MWPCA hereby establishes the Marlborough Water
Pollution Control Plan ("Plan") for the Town.
B. Area of concern. In response to statutory and regulatory requirements
administered and enforced by the Connecticut Department of Energy
and Environmental Protection, the Town initiated a sanitary survey
conducted from 1999 to 2002, to evaluate the condition of the existing
on-site sanitary waste disposal systems in the Lake Terramuggus
Watershed and the Marlborough Town Center Area. The study,
conducted by SEA Consultants, Inc., resulted in the publication of the
Lake Terramuggus Wastewater Facilities Plan for the Town of
Marlborough, Connecticut. On the basis of that facilities plan, the
MWPCA determined the geographical portion of the Town shown and
designated as the "Primary Sewer Service Area" and "Future Sewer
Service Area" on the Sanitary Waste Management Plan in which public
sewer construction is appropriate.
C. Sewer avoidance. Sewer avoidance is a desirable policy for
municipalities where public sewers are located in a limited service area,
do not exist, or are not planned. The MWPCA concludes that sewer
avoidance is appropriate as a policy for the Town outside of the public
sewer services areas depicted on the Sanitary Waste Management Plan.
D. Designation and delineation of service and nonservice areas. The
MWPCA hereby adopts and incorporates in this plan the map entitled
"Sanitary Waste Management Plan." The map officially designates the
Primary Sewer Service District, Secondary Sewer Service District, and
the Sewer Avoidance District.
§ 410-3. Right of revision.
The MWPCA reserves the right to establish, by regulation or through
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards than the existing
requirements and standards of these regulations on discharges to the public
sewer and to its facilities.
§ 410-4. Sewer service district boundaries.
A. The MWPCA hereby establishes a public sewer service district to be
known as the "Marlborough Sewer Service District," as shown on a
map entitled "Sanitary Waste Management Plan" prepared by Tighe and
Bond, Inc., dated December 2009, on file in the office of the Town Clerk
of Marlborough.
B. There is a finite limit to the quantity of sewage that the joint facilities
treatment plant can accept from Marlborough. It is thus not the intent
of the MWPCA to plan for growth of the Marlborough Sewer Service
District boundaries beyond those areas depicted on the Sanitary Waste
Management Plan. It is the role of the MWPCA to allocate flows within
the Marlborough Sewer Service District and to minimize any expansion
of the public sewer into the Sewer Avoidance District.
C. The Marlborough Sewer Service District is defined as depicted on the
Sanitary Waste Management Plan as:
§ 410-2 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-4
1:374
(1) Primary sewer service district. These areas are shown on the map as
being served by present sewer installations and design area.
(2) Secondary sewer service area.
(3) Sewer avoidance district.
§ 410-5. Amendment to district.
The MWPCA recognizes that mitigating circumstances such as community
needs may necessitate future amendments to the district boundaries. Any
request to amend the Sanitary Waste Management Plan boundaries will be
considered by the MWPCA, subject to the following criteria:
A. In considering a request to amend the Sanitary Waste Management Plan
boundaries the MWPCA shall take into consideration the following:
(1) Marlborough Plan of Conservation and Development.
(2) State Plan of Conservation and Development.
(3) Capitol Region Plan of Conservation and Development.
(4) Sanitary Waste Management Plan adopted by the MWPCA.
(5) The Marlborough Inland/Wetland Regulations and Zoning
Regulations.
B. The MWPCA will submit petitions for amendments to the Marlborough
Conservation Commission, the Marlborough Planning Commission, and
the Marlborough Zoning Commission for review and comments.
C. Prior to any vote by the MWPCA to amend the Marlborough Sewer
Service District boundaries a public hearing will be held. The petitioner
shall notify abutting property owners at least 14 days prior to any
hearing date by certificate of mailing, and the hearing must be legally
warned at least 14 days prior to being held.
D. The availability of wastewater pumping and treatment flow capacity as it
relates to the contractual daily flow limits with joint facilities permitted
and capacity of the systems physical facilities at that time.
§ 410-6. Application requirements for amendments to Sanitary
Waste Management Plan.
A. Application form.
B. A written statement of compliance with the policies and goals of the
Town, Regional and State Plans of Conservation and Development.
C. Proposed use of the property and projection of domestic sewage flows
associated with that use(s).
D. An A-2 survey of the boundaries of the petition area that shows the
names of property owners within the amendment area and direct
abutters.
E. Certificate of mailing receipts to abutters.
F. Other information deemed necessary by the MWPCA.
§ 410-7. Validity.
The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence or provisions of these
regulations shall not affect the validity of any other part of these regulations
which can be given effect without the invalid part or parts.

Building Sewers and Connections
§ 410-10. Permits for connections.
Any person proposing a new discharge into the public sewer system or a
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants that are being
discharged into the public sewer system shall apply for a permit per this
article of these regulations. The MWPCA shall be notified more than 30
days prior to the proposed change or connection. The MWPCA shall not
issue a permit for a connection to the public sewer unless there is sufficient
capacity to adequately convey the wastewater flow being requested to the
public sewer.
A. A person intending to connect a building drain from his property to the
public sewer shall first obtain a permit to connect from the MWPCA or
its designated agent. The application shall be made on forms provided by
the MWPCA, and it shall be accompanied by plans showing the proposed
installation in sufficient detail to enable the MWPCA, Building Official,
and the Sanitarian to determine that the proposed installation meets the
requirements of these regulations and other applicable specifications,
codes and laws. The application shall be signed by the owner of the
premises to be served or by his authorized agent, who has been chosen
to perform the work of installing and connecting the building drain to
the public sewer. Following the approval of the application and plan, a
permit shall be issued to have the work performed by a properly licensed
contractor. In the event the premises changes ownership before the work
is completed, or if another contractor is chosen to perform or finish the
work, the original permit shall become void, and a new permit shall be
obtained by the new parties in interest.
B. Connection to the public sewer will be made only after a new building's
plumbing has been approved by the Building Official or his agent to
ensure that minimum standards are met for the installation. Existing
facilities are to have plumbing in good working order and repaired at
the owner's expense as required. A fresh air vent shall be required
for the building. No trench containing a building sewer to the public
sewer shall be backfilled until the Building Official, Sanitarian, and the
MWPCA or its agent has completed an inspection of and approved the
work as necessary under applicable codes and laws. The water level
present in the trench at the time of installation shall be maintained below
the sewer connection before the cap is removed, while the connection
is being made and until such time as it has been inspected, approved
and backfilled. The contractor shall notify the MWPCA, Building Official,
and the Sanitarian at least two business days before starting any work
authorized under the permit.
C. The MWPCA may revoke any permit to connect to the public sewer for
good cause.
§ 410-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-11
1:385
§ 410-11. Responsibility for costs and expenses.
All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the
building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall indemnify
the Town and the MWPCA from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly take place by the installation of the building sewer. The permittee
and property owner agree that they shall at all times indemnify and hold
harmless the MWPCA and the Town and its officers and agents on account
of any and all claims for damages, losses, litigation, expenses, counsel fees
and compensation arising out of injuries (including death) sustained by or
alleged to have been sustained by the public, any or all persons on or near
the work, or by any other person or property, real or personal property of
the Town, which is caused in whole or in part by the acts or omissions of the
permittee, any contractor employed by the permittee or any subcontractor
or person, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by them, or any of them
while engaged in the performance of any work covered by this permit and
during any maintenance period specified or agreed upon in accordance with
this regulation.
§ 410-12. Separate connections.
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building with a common owner stands at the
rear of another on an interior lot and no public sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or
driveway. The building sewer that provides service for the building which
fronts on the public sewer may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer, but the Town does not and will not
assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting
from any such connection. The MWPCA must have legal assurance that
the common ownership of land which the front and rear buildings occupy
cannot be split or subdivided and sold separately through the recording of a
legal document on the Marlborough Land Records restricting such property
division that is satisfactory to the MWPCA prior to the connection of the
buildings to the public sewer.
§ 410-13. Existing building sewers.
Existing building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and testing by the MWPCA through its
agents, employees and persons bearing proper credentials or identification,
to meet all requirements of these regulations. Additional permits may be
required by the Sanitarian and the Building Official.
§ 410-14. Compliance with state requirements.
The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer,
and the methods of excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and
backfilling the trench, and connection of the building sewer to the public
sewer shall all conform to the requirements of the State Public Health Code,
§ 410-11 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-14
1:386
State Building and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations
of the Town and the MWPCA as designated in the permit application. In
the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WEF
Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
§ 410-15. Building sewer elevations.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at
an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drains shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer. Duplex lift systems shall be provided for
commercial and industrial buildings with flows over 1,000 gallons per day
or as otherwise directed by the MWPCA.
§ 410-16. Guarding excavations.
It is the responsibility of the owner and permittee that all excavations for
building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect people from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways,
and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be
restored in a manner satisfactory to the Town.
§ 410-17. Building sewer proximity to water supply well
No building sewer shall be constructed within 25 feet of a water supply
well unless a waiver from the Director of Health is granted. If a building
sewer is constructed within 25 feet to 75 feet of a water supply well, it shall
be constructed in accordance with all applicable guidelines promulgated by
the Commissioner and/or the Connecticut Department of Health Services.
§ 410-18. Grinder pump and proximity to water supply well.
No grinder pump shall be located within 75 feet of a water supply well
unless a waiver from the Director of Health is granted. Additionally, no
grinder pump shall be located within 75 feet of Lake Terramuggus without
approval of the Marlborough Conservation Commission and the MWPCA.

to make the connection to the public sewer within a ninety-day period,
the property owner shall submit a written request to the MWPCA for
an extension of time not to exceed 30 days. The MWPCA may grant
extension(s) of time not to exceed an additional 90 days. Building, health
and MWPCA permits are necessary to connect the building to the sewer line
or grinder pump. Failure to make a connection within 90 days without the
granting of a time extension from the MWPCA will result in removal of the
grinder pump core. Reinstallation of the grinder pump core by the MWPCA
will be made at time of connection, and the property owner will pay a fee to
be determined by the MWPCA for the removal and reinstallation at the time
of filing of an application to connect.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or repair any privy, privy
vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended for the disposal of
sewage if public sewers are available.

of the sewer connection notice shall not receive approval for the
construction of any additional building coverage or vertical expansion to
the existing principal or accessory building(s) on the property or new
building or the construction of a new structure.
§ 410-33. Industrial and commercial waste.
In general, no industrial or commercial wastes, except for the sanitary
wastes generated by employees, will be allowed into the sewer system.
Discharges of wastes other than sanitary waste may be allowed only to
the extent that the discharge substantially complies with pretreatment
standards set forth by the DEEP and EPA. The pretreatment regulations
that apply to industrial and commercial dischargers are an integral part
of these regulations. Industrial and commercial entities shall apply for
a special permit furnished by the MWPCA. The permit application shall
be supplemented by any plans, specifications, approvals, and any other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the MWPCA.

A. Grease, oil and gross particle separators shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Commissioner or the MWPCA, they are necessary for
the proper handling of sewage containing floatable grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful substances;
except that such separators shall not be required for private living
quarters or dwelling units. Grease separators are required at all food
service establishments. Sizing information is to be provided to the
Sanitarian for review and approval and must conform to the IBC
National Plumbing Code, latest edition. Equipment used must be
identified by a plate confirming the Plumbing Drainage Institute rating
in gallons per minute.
B. All separators shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Commissioner or the Sanitarian and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
separators, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which are subject
to review by the Commissioner, the MWPCA, or Sanitarian. Any removal
and hauling of the collected materials shall be performed by a waste
disposal firm which possesses a valid permit from the Commissioner
under C.G.S. § 22a-454, as amended.
§ 410-35. Pretreatment of wastewater.
A. Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any sewage, they shall be maintained in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner(s) at its expense, and the facilities are
subject to inspection and monitoring by the MWPCA.
B. The MWPCA or its designated agent may require any person discharging
into the public sewer to install and maintain, on his property and at
his expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely
for flow equalization. Detailed plans describing such facilities and
operating procedure shall be submitted to the MWPCA or its designated
agent for review and shall be acceptable to the MWPCA or its designated
agent before such facilities are constructed. Users with the potential to
discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain
an approved combustible gas detection meter.
C. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the MWPCA under the provisions of
these regulations.
§ 410-36. Special volume exceptions.
Any new discharge from a single source of domestic wastewater in excess of
2,500 gallons per day will be allowed only by special permit of the MWPCA.
On evaluating the request for a special permit, the MWPCA shall consider
such factors as the potential for flow reduction, the possibility of on-site
disposal for all or a portion of the wastewater, the treatment plant capacity,

§ 410-38. Commissioner review.
A. Permit required.
(1) In accordance with C.G.S. § 22a-430, as amended, a permit from the
Commissioner is required prior to the initiation of a discharge of any
of the following wastewaters to a public sewer:
(a) Industrial wastewater of any quantity.
(b) Domestic sewage in excess of 1% of the design flow of the
receiving water pollution control facility or any domestic sewage
in excess of 50,000 gallons per day.
(2) A potential discharger must submit a permit application to the DEEP
not later than 90 days prior to the anticipated date of initiation of the
proposed discharge.
B. Action by Commissioner.
(1) If any sewage is discharged or is proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers which contains the substances or possesses the
characteristics enumerated in § 410-37 of these regulations, the
Commissioner may, in compliance with C.G.S. § 22a-430, as
amended:
(a) Reject the discharge of the wastes;
(b) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
§ 410-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-38
1:397
(c) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
(2) If the Commissioner permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Commissioner, subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations and
laws.
C. The MWPCA shall have the right to reject the discharge of any wastes
or require more stringent effluent limitations than required by the user's
C.G.S. § 22a-430 permit, the decisions of the Commissioner
notwithstanding. Additionally, the MWPCA may require pretreatment
to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewer, require
control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and require payment
to cover the added cost of processing the wastes not covered by existing
taxes or sewer charges. If the MWPCA permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment for such pretreatment and equalization shall be subject to the
review and the approval of the MWPCA and the DEEP, and subject to
the requirements of all applicable MWPCA, Town, state and/or federal
codes.
D. When required by the Commissioner or the MWPCA, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable structure together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to allow observations,
sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such structure, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by the Commissioner and the
MWPCA. The sampling structure shall be located at a point along the
industrial waste stream where a representative sample of the industrial
wastewater may be obtained prior to its being diluted by domestic
sewage in the building sewer. The structure shall be installed by the
owner at his expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be
safe and accessible at all times.
E. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the MWPCA and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the MWPCA for treatment, provided that
such agreement does not contravene any requirements of existing state
or federal regulations or the standards of the Joint Facilities Treatment
Plant's NPDES permit and is compatible with any user-charge and
industrial-cost-recovery system in effect.
§ 410-39. Measurement and testing.
A. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and sewage to which reference is made in these regulations shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods
for Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined by analysis of
suitable samples taken at appropriate locations.
§ 410-38 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-39
1:398
B. Sampling methods, location, times, durations and frequencies are to
be determined on an individual basis, subject to the stipulations and
general conditions of the discharger's state discharge permit. Sampling
shall be carried out by the customarily accepted methods to reflect
the effect of constituents on the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all
outfalls of a property is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls;
whereas pH levels are determined from periodic grab samples.
C. When required by the MWPCA, the owner of any property serviced by
a building sewer shall install a suitable control manhole, together with
such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
allow observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his expense, shall be maintained by
the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the MWPCA or its
designated agent. In the event no special manhole has been required,
the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which building sewer is
connected.
D. All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform such
monitoring of their discharge as required by the Commissioner in any
state discharge permit issued pursuant to C.G.S. § 22a-430, as amended,
including, but not limited to, installation, use and maintenance of
monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results to the
Commissioner. Such records shall be made available upon request of the
Commissioner, the MWPCA or the Town Sanitarian.
§ 410-40. Federal standards.
Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standard for
a particular industrial subcategory than is more stringent than limitations
imposed under these regulations for sources in that subcategory, the federal
standard shall supersede the limitations under these regulations.
§ 410-41. Dilution.
No user shall increase the use of process water in an attempt to dilute
a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical
pretreatment standards or in any specific pollutant limitations which may
be developed by the Commissioner.
§ 410-42. Accidental discharge protection.
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by these regulations. Facilities to
prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
§ 410-39 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-42
1:399
maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense when required
by the Commissioner or MWPCA. The Commissioner or the MWPCA may
require that plans showing facilities and operating procedures be submitted
for review and approval prior to construction of the facilities.
A. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit
to the MWPCA, the water pollution control facility superintendent and
the Commissioner a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to mitigate the
accidental discharge and to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the water
pollution control facility, fish, aquatic plants, or any other persons or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this regulation or
other applicable law.
B. Notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
§ 410-43. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control
of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, lack of
adequate training, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical standards if the requirements of
Subsection C below are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence, that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the MWPCA or
its designated agent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset.
Reporting to the MWPCA or its designated agent does not relieve the
user from other state or federal reporting requirements.
D. A description of the groundwater and cause of noncompliance.
E. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if
not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
F. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
§ 410-42 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-43
1:400
G. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
H. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim
of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical standards.
I. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical standards upon reduction, loss
or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in
the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of
the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
§ 410-44. Sealing discontinued building sewers and connections.
A. When any building or structure, or portions thereof, or any public sewer
is destroyed, demolished, abandoned or altered in a manner that any
building drain is no longer or will no longer be connected to the house
connection, the building sewer shall be capped at the street line for
gravity sewers and at the pump chamber for any individual grinder
pump. Capping of the sewer line shall be done by a licensed drainlayer
and requires a permit from the MWPCA.
B. Prior to issuance of any demolition permit from the Building Official,
the building sewer shall be capped, and if any owner is to abandon a
connection, the owner shall notify the MWPCA at least 30 days prior
to such abandonment of use. In the event of unplanned destruction or
demolition of a building or structure, the building sewer shall be capped
as soon as possible after the occurrence of the damage.
§ 410-45. Ownership and responsibility.
A. The MWPCA shall be responsible for inspections, repairs to,
maintenance of and reconstruction of the public sewer mains and pump
station. The MWPCA shall not provide service calls to building sewer
lines that are the responsibility of the property owner.
B. The MWPCA shall own and maintain the motor, pump and shredder
portions of the grinder pump only if it has been provided as a part of a
publicly funded project and only for the life of the public funding, and
if the owner has executed a grinder pump access agreement with the
MWPCA. In all other cases, the property owner shall own and maintain
the grinder pump and all appurtenances. In all cases the property owner
shall be responsible for payment of charges for electrical utility service
for operation of a grinder pump.
C. It is the sole responsibility of the property owner serviced by the public
sewer to maintain the building sewer and/or grinder pump in accordance
with these regulations and is a condition of a permit for discharge.
The property owner shall be responsible for the inspections, repairs
to, maintenance of and reconstruction of the building sewer and all
appurtenances of such building sewer.
D. In the event of a complaint regarding a sewer stoppage, the MWPCA
representative will ascertain if the main sewer line is clear, and any
stoppages therein will be relieved as quickly as possible. If the main
§ 410-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-45
1:401
sewer line is clear, the MWPCA representative will inform the owner
that stoppage is on its property and it needs to employ at its own
expense a licensed plumber or a drainlayer to clear the stoppage or
commence the necessary repairs to the building sewer. If the owner or
its representative ascertains the stoppage is within the house lateral
located in the street right-of-way, the MWPCA shall correct said
stoppage.
E. If the examination by a property owner or its designated service
professional reveals a problem within the building sewer, the following
actions should be taken for the investigation:
(1) Broken pipe. If the examination reveals that a break may lie within
the public sewer, the property owner shall contact the MWPCA. The
MWPCA will evaluate the problem area. If the break is found to be
within the public sewer, it will be repaired by the MWPCA. If the
break is found in the building sewer, all costs associated with the
repair shall be borne by the property owner, as well as costs incurred
by the MWPCA for the examination and/or repair.
(2) Obstruction. If the examination reveals that an obstruction of any
nature has occurred at any point within the building sewer, all costs
for removal of the obstruction shall be the sole responsibility of the
property owner, including all costs incurred by the MWPCA for the
examination and/or removal of the obstruction.
F. If the MWPCA determines that there is an infiltration or inflow into the
building sewer, the property owner shall make all necessary repairs at
its expense after receipt of notice from the MWPCA. If a property owner
fails to make necessary repairs and the MWPCA determines that action
is necessary to repair or replace the building sewer, the MWPCA will
make the required repairs and seek appropriate reimbursement from the
property owner.

hauler when 25% of the operating depth of the FOG interceptor is
occupied by grease and settled solids or a minimum of once every
three months, whichever is more frequent.
(2) If the contact person can provide data demonstrating that less
frequent cleaning of the FOG interceptor will not result in a grease
level in excess of 25% of the operating depth of the FOG interceptor,
the MWPCA may allow less frequent cleaning. The contact person
shall provide data, including pumping receipts for four consecutive
cleanings of the FOG interceptor, complete with a report from the
§ 410-50 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-51
1:406
FOG hauler, indicating the grease level at each cleaning, and the
FOG interceptor or maintenance log.
(3) A maintenance log shall be maintained on the premises and shall
include the following information: dates of all activities, volume
pumped, grease depth, hauler's name, location of the waste disposal,
means of disposal for all material removed from the FOG interceptor,
and the name of the individual recording the information. The
maintenance log and waste hauler's receipts shall be made available
to the MWPCA for inspection on demand. Interceptor cleaning and
inspection records shall be maintained on file a minimum of five
years.
F. All removal and hauling of the collected materials must be performed
by state-licensed waste hauler. Pumped material shall be disposed of
at a regional FOG disposal facility. Pumping shall include the complete
removal of all contents, including floating materials, sewage and settled
sludge. Decanting back into the FOG interceptor shall not be permitted.
FOG interceptor cleaning shall include scraping excessive solids from
the walls, floors, baffles and all piping.
§ 410-52. FOG minimization.
A. The contact person shall make every practical effort to reduce the
amount of FOG contributed to the sewage system.
B. Renderable fats, oils and grease shall not be discharged into any building
connector or FOG interceptor. All renderable fats, oils and grease shall

there are no viable alternative methods to comply with DEEP orders or
to remedy a pressing pollution problem.
B. The MWPCA shall specify the terms and the nature of and limitations
on the water or waste liquids to be conveyed. Sewer plans must be
approved by the MWPCA prior to permitting the commencement of
work, and said plans for sewer work must be prepared by a professional
engineer.
§ 410-55. Authorized agreements with developers and other owners.
The MWPCA is authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of the Town
with developers or other owners of land for the construction of sewers
and related appurtenances by and at the expense of such developers or
owners, which sewers may become part of the public sewer system under
the conditions hereinafter stipulated. The Chairman of the MWPCA is
authorized to sign, on behalf of the MWPCA, all such agreements when the
same have been authorized by the MWPCA. The terms and the text of a
standard form of agreement for work under these regulations is attached as
Appendix A to these regulations.52 Any variations of said standard form for
any particular project thereunder shall require the approval of the MWPCA.
§ 410-56. Provisions of agreement.
A. Plans and specifications. The MWPCA shall specify the terms of such
plans and specifications which are made a part thereof, the limits, sizes
and grades of piping and appropriate materials, and the nature of and
limitation on the wastes or liquids to be conveyed.
B. Costs. Such agreements shall provide that the full cost of construction
of the sewer and all expense thereto shall be borne by the developer or
owner. Additionally, the developer or owner shall reimburse the MWPCA
for any incidental costs incurred by the MWPCA and/or the Town
concerning the project, such as review and approval of the plans and
specifications, verification of field data and information, changes to plan,
inspections, traffic control, etc.
C. Insurance. All such agreements shall provide that the developer or
owner or the contractor engaged by the developer or owner to perform
the work shall assume all risks and hold the Town harmless from any
and all claims for damages arising from the work or its conduct. To
secure against such risks, adequate liability, property damage and
compensation insurance in amounts fixed by the MWPCA and in content
and form acceptable by the MWPCA's legal counsel shall be required of
the developer or owner or contractor performing the work, who shall
52.Editor's Note: Said Appendix A is on file
§ 410-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-56
1:409
furnish proper and acceptable certificates of insurance before starting
work.
D. Bonding authority. The MWPCA shall require as part of said agreement
that a performance bond guaranteed by surety acceptable to the
MWPCA in amount and form be submitted to insure proper completion
and maintenance of the work for a period of time defined by the MWPCA
after construction is complete.
E. Inspection. The developer shall pay an inspection fee determined by
the MWPCA to the MWPCA prior to commencement of work. If the
inspection fee is expended prior to the completion of the construction,
the developer shall submit addition funds as determined by the MWPCA
within five business days after receipt of the request for additional
funds. The work undertaken under such agreements shall be under the
direction of the MWPCA. An inspector will be assigned by the MWPCA
to inspect all work under such agreements. Any work performed without
proper inspection may not be accepted and shall be uncovered and
may be required to be removed and rebuilt if required by the inspector
or the MWPCA. Any work performed that does not comply with the
specifications and standards of the Town and the orders of the MWPCA
will be stopped until there has been compliance with all requirements.
§ 410-57. Incorporation into the public system.
After certification by the MWPCA that any sewer construction under the
terms of an agreement has been done in accordance with these regulations
and the plans, specifications and standards of the MWPCA, and that any
maintenance period fixed in the agreement has expired, or that adequate
security by bond or otherwise has been furnished to assure such
restoration, the MWPCA may incorporate said sewer into the public sewer
system of the Town.
§ 410-58. Town authority.
No provision of this section shall be construed to reduce or diminish the
requirements of the Town and any other authority having jurisdiction over
the owner or agent for the extension.
§ 410-59. Right-of-way easements.
When the work is not in an accepted public highway right-of-way, easements
shall be conveyed to the MWPCA or Town prior to the acceptance of the
sewer; said easements shall be satisfactory to the MWPCA and/or the Town.
§ 410-60. As-built drawings.
Upon completion of the work and prior to acceptance of the sewer and
water lines, the developer or owner shall furnish the MWPCA with "as-built"

ARTICLE VII
Sewer Benefit Assessment Policy
§ 410-61. Statement of purpose.
The purpose of this sewer benefit assessment policy is to provide the basis
for levying sewer benefit assessments against properties located in the
Town, as authorized by Chapter 103 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 410-62. Collection of water pollution control revenues.
There is hereby established the title of Collector of Water Pollution Control
Revenues (CWPCR). The CWPCR is hereby designated as the person
entitled and empowered to prepare and cause to be recorded in the
Marlborough Land Records all notices of assessments, notices of
installment payment of assessment, notices of deferred assessment and
notices continuing liens for unpaid and delinquent assessments. Said
CWPCR is hereby empowered to collect sewer assessments in accordance
with any provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes for the collection
of property taxes. Said CWPCR is further designated the person who is
empowered to collect all sewer use and connection charges in accordance
with the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes.

F. Any other use of property benefiting from the availability of public
sewers.
§ 410-64. Base sewer benefit assessment - equivalent dwelling unit.
The minimum base assessment to be levied against all properties is to
recover capital expenditures in a reasonable manner based on the value of
having the benefit of public sewers. The minimum base assessment amount
is subject to change by action of the MWPCA as the rates of inflation, prices
and costs increase or decrease. As provided below, the equivalent-dwellingunit
charge may be modified depending on the particular use classification
of the property.
§ 410-65. Determination of amount of sewer benefit assessment.
A. In accordance with C.G.S. § 7-249, as amended, the MWPCA will
determine the sewer benefit assessment. The total benefit amount is
determined by taking the minimum base assessment rate and
multiplying it by the EDUs for the applicable property. In accordance
with C.G.S. § 7-250 as amended, the MWPCA shall hold a public hearing
on the assessment and send notice of said public hearing and assessment
amount to any affected property owner. Appeals of assessments are to
be made to the Superior Court Judicial District at Hartford, County of
Hartford within the time frame specified in C.G.S. § 7-250, as amended.
B. In addition to and in recognition of the appreciated value of the
availability of public sewers by reason of inflation and property
appreciation and the costs of financing the original sewer construction
loans and carrying such loans for the benefit of subsequent users, the
minimum base assessment rate computed for future users of the system,
in accordance with the herein-outlined assessment policy, shall be
subject to yearly increases.
§ 410-66. Vacant land and buildings or structures constructed or
expanded after initial assessment.
Vacant residential land will not be assessed by the MWPCA until such time
as it is developed and derives a direct benefit from the public sewer. Vacant
commercial or industrial land will be assessed one EDU. The assessment
of vacant land and the assessment of building or structures constructed or
expanded after the initial assessment shall be subject to the provisions of
§§ 410-70 and 410-71 below.
§ 410-63 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-67
1:414
§ 410-67. Deferred assessments for public properties.
Sewer assessments for public properties may be deferred. Assessments
so deferred shall be assumed by the Town and not assumed by the other
property owners using the public sewer. Record of said deferment and the
amount of assessment shall be kept at the office of the Town Clerk and,
should the ownership of said property be changed or should public property
be used for other purposes, the assessment will become due and payable.
§ 410-68. Deferred assessments for private properties.
A. Sewer assessments for private properties may be deferred if the
property contains a one-hundred-percent fully code-compliant septic
system, including one-hundred-percent reserve area, and the septic
system was installed after September 1, 2004.
B. If the property owner seeks a connection to the public sewer, then the
full assessment will become due and payable prior to issuance of a
permit to connect.
§ 410-69. Amount of deferred assessments.
The amount of a deferred assessment shall be calculated at the time a
connection is sought as described in § 410-70A of these regulations.
§ 410-70. Determination of special connection charges.
In general, the following rule or method for determining a special
connection charge shall be used as the basis for assessing properties
previously deferred or unassessed for their share of benefits derived from
the construction of local sewers and for the apportionment of sanitary
sewers built by developers and for properties previously assessed which
have or will have a greater intensity of use in accordance with the
Connecticut General Statutes.
A. Deferred assessments. Wherever an assessment has been deferred and
a connection to the sewer system is sought, a deferred assessment
charge shall be imposed. Calculation of the deferred assessment charge
shall be determined by taking the minimum base assessment rate and
multiplying it by the EDUs for the applicable property. The minimum
base assessment used for the calculation is the applicable rate for the
year the deferment is sought.
B. Sewers built by developers or other owners.
(1) Wherever a developer has installed a local sewer passing through
land owned by others in accordance with the provisions of § 410-55
of these regulations, a special connection charge shall be imposed,
consisting of the connection charge applicable at the time the
connection is sought and any other MWPCA charge that is a part of
a particular developer's agreement.
(2) For the purposes of the remainder of this section of the regulations
with regard to a parcel of property, a "developer," "an owner" or
an "owner's agent" will be referred to as an "owner" or "owners."
§ 410-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-70
1:415
The owner of another property related to that of an owner only by
proximity will be referred to as an "owner of other property."
(3) When a sewer has been built for the MWPCA under a developer's
permit agreement and passes land owned by an owner of other
property who may request a house connection to the sewer, no
connection shall be permitted by the MWPCA unless:
(a) The owner of other property pays a special connection charge as
§ 410-70 of these regulations; or
(b) (Reserved)
(c) The MWPCA has approved the design of the sewer connection
sought.
C. Assessment of properties not previously assessed. Whenever a sewer
has been laid out and constructed by the MWPCA after the initial
construction phase to serve a particular section of highway or a
particular area, no connection will be permitted thereto for any property
which has not been previously assessed. The MWPCA may, by
appropriate vote, permit payment of said assessment over a period to be
determined by the MWPCA.
D. Charges for industrial users of federally financed sewage systems.
Industrial cost-recovery payments required by the EPA and the
Commissioner shall be determined, billed and paid for in accordance
with the most current and applicable federal rules and regulations,
as published and amended. Disbursement of the funds recovered from
industrial users shall also be made by the Town in accordance with the
same rules and regulations.
§ 410-71. Supplemental charges for increased intensity of use.
Wherever an assessment has been levied against a property and an
increased intensity of use has taken or will take place, such as construction
of new or expanded buildings or structures or a substantial change in
use after the initial assessment has been levied, a supplemental sewer
connection charge may be imposed. The MWPCA, in such cases, shall
determine the amount of the additional connection charge to be levied
against such land in accordance with the increased intensity of use and in
accordance with the established formula for levying such charges, which
shall take into consideration any previous assessment charges levied. No
building permit shall be granted for said construction until the special
connection charge so levied by the MWPCA has been paid or until an
agreement providing for the payment of said charge over a period of time,
executed by the landowner and suitable for recording on the Land Records,
has been completed and delivered to the MWPCA.
§ 410-72. Collection of deferred assessments.
When a deferred assessment is declared due and payable, it shall be
collectible in the same manner and in the same amount as defined in
§ 410-64 of these regulations.
§ 410-70 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-73
1:416
§ 410-73. Collection of special connection charges when no
assessment has been made.
In all cases in which the MWPCA has constructed or caused to be
constructed through a developer's agreement a public sanitary sewer or
sewers through any public highway or highways within its territorial limits
or its jurisdiction, for which no assessment of benefits and damages has
been made, the MWPCA may establish special connection charges as
defined in § 410-70 of these regulations. If the MWPCA elects to extend the
payment of the assessment over a period of years, as provided in § 410-75 of
these regulations, the special connection charges may be payable in equal
annual installments until such time as the equitable cost of installing such
sewer has been paid by the property owner or owners whose property has
been benefited by the construction and use of such sewer.
§ 410-74. Sewer use charge adjustments.
Special rates may be established where unusual conditions exist, at the
discretion of the MWPCA. Minimum charges may also be adopted.
§ 410-75. General payment information.
A. Sewer benefit assessments levied as part of any future construction of
Marlborough's sewerage system may be payable over a period of years,
not to exceed 20 years, as determined by the MWPCA. The unpaid
balance of a benefit assessment may be assumed by any subsequent
owner of the property on transfer of the property.
B. The MWPCA may adopt a plan subject to the limitations of C.G.S.
§ 7-253a, which allows for the deferral of principal payments for those
elderly taxpayers eligible for property tax relief under the provisions of
C.G.S. §§ 12-129b and 12-170a.53
C. The MWPCA may levy sewer benefit assessments under the terms of
developer's agreements that are generally in accordance with the
provisions of the policy. Details of such payment terms are available from
the Administrator of the MWPCA.
D. Assessments for public properties may be deferred. Any deferred
assessments shall be assumed by the Town and not assumed solely by
the property owners within the sewer service district. At such time
that the public property is transferred to a private entity, the benefit
assessment will be applied to the property.

ARTICLE VIII
Annual Sewer Use Charge System
§ 410-76. Annual levy.
In accordance with the provisions of C.G.S. § 7-255, as amended, a use
charge shall be levied annually on all properties connected to the public
sewer.
§ 410-77. Basis for charge.
A. The annual charge for each residential property shall be based upon
the equivalent discharge by a single-family dwelling unit of 300 gallons
per day sanitary wastes per day. A single-family dwelling unit shall be
defined as a three-bedroom dwelling unit or less.
B. "Equivalent dwelling unit" (EDU) is a unit with approximately the same
average discharge as a single-family dwelling unit. An additional 0.25
EDU shall be added for each bedroom in a single-family dwelling unit
above three bedrooms.
C. Charges for nonresidential uses will be based on the technical standards
of the State of Connecticut Public Health Code and an additional flow
factor of 1.25. Food service establishments' flow will include 50 takeout
meals per day.
D. Any property which does not fit within the classifications set forth in the
State of Connecticut Public Health Code will be given an EDU number
based upon the estimated average discharge of wastes per day of the
planned use as compared to the average discharge of sanitary wastes
per day of a single-family dwelling unit.
E. A minimum of one EDU shall be assigned to each property required to
be connected to the public sewer.
F. EDUs for properties with multiple uses will be based upon the sum of the
EDU for each use.
G. The sewer use charge for users discharging high-strength wastes or
other pollutants will be additionally charged based on the cost of
treating the wastewater or managing the effluent or sludge.
§ 410-78. Base rate.
A. The MWPCA shall annually adopt a projected Operation, Maintenance
and Replacement Budget. The budget so adopted shall be divided by the
anticipated number of EDUs to be connected to the system to establish
the base user fee rate to be charged for each EDU. In computing
individual user charges (base rate multiplied by the property's EDU
number), the number of EDUs shall be rounded to the hundredth and the
charge derived from this calculation shall be rounded off to the nearest
dollar.
B. The operation and maintenance portion of the budget shall be adjusted
annually to reflect the actual costs incurred in the previous fiscal year
and anticipated cost increases. No money transfer resulting from excess
operation and maintenance budget expenses shall be transferred to any
other Town accounts. The money shall be retained solely for sewer usage
budget items.
§ 410-76 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-78
1:419
C. The MWPCA will hold a public hearing yearly on the Operation,
Maintenance and Replacement Budget and the annual user charge.
Appeals of user charge assessments are to be made to the Superior
Court Judicial District at Hartford, County of Hartford within the time
frame specified in C.G.S. § 7-255, as amended.
§ 410-79. Due dates for user fee payments.
A. Payment of the initial user fee charge will be due at the time of the
connection to the sewer and will cover the proportionate share of a full
year for the period from the connection through the annual use fee due
date as determined by the MWPCA. Subsequent use charges will be due
and payable in full on or before the annual due date.
B. User fee charges shall be payable by October 31 each year. In the case
of a property which was not connected during the entire period, the
charges shall be prorated on a monthly basis for the actual number
of months within the stated period that the property was connected. A
period of 15 days or more shall be deemed a full month.
§ 410-80. Liability for payment.
A. Owners of property against which the user charge is levied shall be liable
for payment and for interest on delinquent payment from the due date
until such charge is paid in full. Interest shall be computed in the manner
provided in C.G.S. § 7-258 and C.G.S. § 12-146, as amended.
B. Sewer charges not paid within one year of the due date shall be
delinquent; such charges together with interest thereon shall constitute
a lien on the property on which the building is located, and such lien may
be foreclosed and such charges may be collected in the matter provided
in the Connecticut General Statutes for property tax liens. Each such
lien shall take precedence over all other liens and encumbrances except
property taxes and may be foreclosed in the same manner as a lien for
property taxes.
§ 410-81. Collection of water pollution control revenues.
Shall be done in accordance with § 410-72.
§ 410-82. Collection of user charge for unconnected properties.
All properties not connected after issuance of the connection notice shall be
liable for the annual user charge.

ARTICLE IX
Inspection, Penalties, Validity
§ 410-83. Powers and authority of inspectors.
A. The MWPCA, through its officers, agents, employees and persons in
contract with it bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be
permitted to enter all properties within the sewer district and gain
access for purposes of grinder pump inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of
these regulations.
B. During the performance of the necessary work on private properties
referred to in the above subsection, the MWPCA through its officers,
agents and employees shall observe all safety rules applicable. The user
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the MWPCA officers, agents
and employees, and the MWPCA and the Town shall indemnify the user
against loss or damage to its property by the MWPCA officers, agents
and employees and against liability claims and demands for personal
injury or property damage asserted against the user and growing out of
the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by
negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe conditions as required
in § 410-16 of these regulations.
§ 410-84. Permission to enter private property.
A. Where the MWPCA/Town holds a duly negotiated easements or grinder
pump agreement, entry onto the property for the purposes of, but not
limited to, inspection of any portion of the sewage works lying within
said easement or agreement area will take place from time to time with
reasonable notice when possible. All entry and subsequent work, if any,
on said easement or agreement area shall be done in full accordance
with the terms of the negotiated easement pertaining to the private
property involved and/or the conditions of the grinder pump agreement.
B. If the MWPCA or its designated agent has been refused access to a
building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and believe that
there may be a violation of these regulations or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the MWPCA designed to verify compliance with these
regulations or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
MWPCA or its designated agent may seek issuance of a search warrant
from the Superior Court Judicial District at Hartford, Hartford County.
§ 410-85. Permitted construction times.
No sewer or appurtenance may be cut into or connection made therewith,
or any pipe laid, except in the presence of or under the directions of an
inspector authorized by the MWPCA. At least three business days' notice
must be given to the agent of the MWPCA before such inspector is needed
on the work. In general, inspectors will be available between the hours
of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays. Deviation of these
§ 410-83 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-85
1:421
construction times is only permitted after authorization by the MWPCA or
in the case of emergency construction.
§ 410-86. Penalties.
Any person found to be violating any provision of these regulations shall
be served by the MWPCA with written notice, stating the nature of the
violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory
correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in
such notice, permanently cease all violations. Any person violating any of
the provisions of these regulations and/or any provisions of a wastewater
discharge permit issued by the MWPCA will be subject to the provisions of
Article X, Administrative Enforcement Remedies, and/or Article XI, Judicial
Enforcement Remedies, of these regulations and shall become liable to
the MWPCA and the Town for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by
reason of such violation.
§ 410-87. Reports from users.
All users shall provide appropriate reports to the MWPCA or its designated
agent as the MWPCA or its designated agent may require as a part of
a permit to discharge or from time to time when the MWPCA finds it
necessary to request such reports. Failure to submit the required reports
to the MWPCA is a violation of these regulations, and the MWPCA will
take the appropriate action in accordance with Article X, Administrative
Enforcement Remedies, and/or Article XI, Judicial Enforcement Remedies,
of these regulations.
§ 410-88. Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the MWPCA or its designated agent within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the MWPCA or its designated
agent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation or sooner if
requested by the MWPCA. Failure to submit the required reports to the
MWPCA is a violation of these regulations, and the MWPCA will take
the appropriate action in accordance with Article X, Administrative
Enforcement Remedies, and/or Article XI, Judicial Enforcement Remedies,
of these regulations.
§ 410-89. Discharge standards.
All discharges shall be in accordance with the qualities defined in these
regulations. Should the MWPCA determine that the sewage does not come
within the standards, the MWPCA shall order the user to implement
pretreatment of the effluent to meet those standards. Any additional cost to
the MWPCA for the treatment because of these discharges shall be directly
passed on to the user responsible for such discharge.

ARTICLE X
Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 410-90. Notification of violation.
A. When the MWPCA or its designated agent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the MWPCA or its designated agent may serve
upon that user a written notice of violation. Within five business days
of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the MWPCA or its
designated agent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user
of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
MWPCA or its designated agent to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
B. Any party in receipt of a notice of violation may petition in writing to the
MWPCA that a show cause hearing in accordance with § 410-92 be held
by the MWPCA.
§ 410-91. Consent orders.
The MWPCA or its designated agent may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.
Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to
correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.
Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative
orders issued pursuant to §§ 410-93 and 410-94 of these regulations and
shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 410-92. Show cause hearing.
Allows users that receive a notice of violation an opportunity to appear
before the MWPCA or its designated agent and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice of a show cause
hearing shall be served on the user, specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and
a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or
by certificate of mailing at least five days prior to the hearing. Such notice
may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action
against the user.
§ 410-90 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-93
1:423
§ 410-93. Compliance orders.
When the MWPCA or its designated agent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the MWPCA or its designated agent may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user
come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also
may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize
the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any
other action against the user.
§ 410-94. Cease and desist orders.
A. When the MWPCA or its designated agent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the MWPCA or its designated agent may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user
to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for the MWPCA taking any other action against the user.
§ 410-95. Emergency suspensions.
A. The MWPCA or its designated agent may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The MWPCA or its designated
agent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure
to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
MWPCA or its designated agent may take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection,
§ 410-93 MARLBOROUGH CODE § 410-95
1:424
to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream,
or endangerment to any individuals. The MWPCA or its designated
agent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the MWPCA or its designated
agent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in § 410-27 of these regulations are
initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the MWPCA
or its designated agent prior to the date of any show cause or
termination hearing under § 410-27 or 410-92 of these regulations.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
§ 410-96. Termination of discharge.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 410-27 of these regulations, any user/
owner who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards of these regulations.
B. Such user/owner will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 410-92 of
these regulations why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the MWPCA or its designated agent shall not be a bar
to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

ARTICLE XI
Judicial Enforcement Remedies
§ 410-97. Injunctive relief.
When the MWPCA or its designated agent finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the MWPCA or its designated agent may petition
the Superior Court Judicial District at Hartford, County of Hartford through
the MWPCA's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by these regulations on activities of the user/owner.
The MWPCA or its designated agent may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action
against a user/owner.
§ 410-98. Administrative fine.
A. A user/owner who has violated or continues to violate any provision
of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be
liable to the Town for a maximum civil penalty of $250 per violation per
day in accordance with C.G.S. § 7-148(c)(10)(A). In the case of a monthly
or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
B. The MWPCA or its designated agent may recover reasonable attorneys'
fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of
any actual damages incurred by the MWPCA.
C. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite
for taking any other action against a user/owner.
§ 410-99. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in these regulations are not exclusive. The
MWPCA or its designated agent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user.
§ 410-100. Criminal prosecution.
In addition to other actions available to the MWPCA, the MWPCA may
institute criminal prosecution of any person or user, as allowed by state and
federal law, for violation of the provisions of these regulations.

§ 410-101. (Reserved)
§ 410-102. Performance bonds.
The MWPCA or its designated agent may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of these regulations, a previous wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to
the MWPCA and Town, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by
the MWPCA or its designated agent to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
§ 410-103. Liability insurance.
The MWPCA or its designated agent may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of these regulations, a previous wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW
caused by its discharge.

Public Access to Information
§ 410-104. Public information.
In accordance with C.G.S. Chapter 14, Freedom of Information Act, all
information maintained by the MWCPA relating to the operation and
maintenance of the public sewer system shall be available to the public
without restriction.
§ 410-105. User request for exclusion of records from public access.
Public access to records will only be restricted when the user specifically
requests in writing to the MWPCA for exclusion of its records and is able
to demonstrate the statutory authority for the granting of such request,
or other legal or satisfactory reason that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state and federal law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of information or data.
§ 410-106. Confidentiality.
If the MWPCA finds that a user can demonstrate certain information made
available to the MWPCA shall be held confidential, the portions of
information received that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall be held in a file denoting that the information in that file is not to be
made available for public inspection. However, any confidential information
shall be made available immediately upon request of governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program, pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report or
the property owner. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
