application fee. The Village shall have thirty (30) days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or it is deemed approved, if the
applicant has notified the Village of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which notification
may be submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of a resubmitted application is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original
notice of denial. This subsection does not apply if a revised application is not resubmitted within thirty (30) days, or curing any
deficiencies in the original application requires review of a new location, new or different structure for collocation, new antennas, or
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. In such cases, a new application and application fee are required.
J. Consolidated Applications: Consolidated applications for small wireless facilities for the collocation of up to twenty-five (25)
small wireless facilities shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure. Each consolidated application shall provide all the information required by this chapter for
each small wireless facility at each location. If such an application includes incomplete information for one or more small wireless
facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless facilities that do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are otherwise
denied, the Village may remove such collocation requests from the application and treat them as separate requests. Separate permits
may be issued for each collocation approved in a consolidated application.
K. Alternate Locations: If an applicant is seeking to install a new utility pole as part of its application, the Village may propose that the
small wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the
proposed collocation. The applicant shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has the right to use the location on
reasonable terms and conditions, unless the alternate location imposes technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the
applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location based on the foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence in
the form of a written certification, under oath, describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the
alternate location from being utilized.
L. Exemptions: No application, permit approval or fee shall be required from a communications service provider authorized to
occupy the right-of-way when the work in question is for:
1. Routine maintenance not requiring replacement of wireless facilities if the wireless provider notifies the Village in writing
at least forty-eight hours prior to the planned maintenance;
2. The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the
wireless provider notifies the Village in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment
specifications, including (i) equipment type and model numbers, for the replacement of equipment consistent with the equipment
specifications information required on a permit application for original installation; and (ii) information sufficient to establish that the
replacement is substantially similar. The wireless provider shall provide all information necessary and requested by the Village to
establish that the replacement is substantially similar. The Village has the sole right and responsibility to determine if a proposed small
wireless facility is substantially similar to the existing small wireless facility; or
3. The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on
cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
The foregoing shall not exempt communications service providers from Village permitting requirements where traffic patterns are
affected or lane closures are required.
13-8-6: CONSTRUCTION: Collocations for which permits are approved shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days of
issuance of the permit, unless the Village agrees to extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Village utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the applicant has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not
exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Permits that are not completed within applicable timelines shall be void
absent an extension granted in writing by the Village.
13-8-7: PERMIT DURATION: Permits issued for small wireless facilities pursuant to this chapter shall be for a period of five (5)
years. Permits are subject to renewal at the end of the five (5) year permit period for a successive five (5) year term so long as the
installation complies with the applicable code provisions in force at the time of renewal. A finding by the Village at the time of a request for
renewal that an installation does not comply with the applicable code provisions in force at the time of the renewal request shall be in
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

by a public safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable
interference is determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless
facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference,
including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider
is not making a good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for
interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672
through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations
sections cited above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance and the small wireless
facility may be abated through the procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this code.
B. A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small wireless facility that:
1. Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a right-of-way;
2. Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
3. Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;

forth in section 7-1G-21 (Variances) of chapter 7-1G (Construction of Utility Facilities in Rights of Way) of this code, to allow a small
wireless facility to be located above ground in an area where Village ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if,
in addition to demonstrating the conditions of section 7-1G-21 have been established, the wireless provider can establish that:
a. Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no reasonable alternative or location that is more
aesthetically favorable to adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-way; and
b. An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location is necessary at the proposed location to provide
coverage in a specified area; and
c. An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or
constitute a safety hazard; and
d. An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies;
and
e. Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the above ground small wireless facility at the proposed
location; and
f. An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location will not create a safety hazard; and
g. The above ground small wireless facility is located and designed in such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on
adjacent properties; and
h. In any historical area, that the above ground small wireless facility will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of
the area.
3. Screening for Ground Mounted Facilities. Where a ground-mounted facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened
around the perimeter in accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer. Plant materials shall include a
mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance of all
landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
4. Future Undergrounding: The Village may, from time to time, make a decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a
particular type generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of the Village. In the event that such a utility pole has a
collocated small wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the Village shall either:
a. Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for
the collocation of the small wireless facility; or
b. Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its
own utility pole so it can maintain service from that location.
F. Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the Village
utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving
the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have
the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers.

order of any court.
TAXPAYER: Any person engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing, or selling gas or electricity for use or
consumption within the corporate limits of the village; or any person using or consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail
and used or consumed within the corporate limits of the village.
E. Effective Date Of Taxes: Any amount of taxes due and payable for any tax levied for any tax period prior to the effective date of this
section shall remain due and payable in the manner provided at such time for such taxes regardless of the provisions of this
section. The tax established in subsection A1 of this section shall be based on the "gross receipts", as herein defined, actually paid
to the taxpayer for services billed on and after November 1, 1991.
F. Returns: The taxes authorized by this section shall be remitted by the taxpayer to the village not later than the last day of the month
subsequent to the month in which a bill is issued by the taxpayer. Each taxpayer shall make a return to the village treasurer for the
previous month, stating the following:
1. The taxpayer's name;
2. The taxpayer's principal place of business;
3. The taxpayer's gross receipts or the kilowatt-hours used, as applicable, during those months upon the basis of which the tax is

The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making such return, pay the village treasurer the amount
of tax herein imposed; provided, that in connection with any return the taxpayer may, if the taxpayer so elects, report and pay an
amount based upon its total billings of business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made (exclusive of any
amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon any differences between such billings and the
taxable gross receipts or the kilowatt-hours used, as applicable. Where a taxpayer's total tax owed to the village averages less
than twenty five dollars ($25.00) per month in any calendar quarter, the taxpayer may request permission from the village
treasurer to file a return on a calendar quarter, rather than a monthly, basis.
G. Credits For Overpayment: If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this
section, whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due, or to

manner as the original charge for delivering the electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to subsection A1b of this
section and any such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt owed to the village by such person
delivering the electricity. With respect to such debt owed to the village, the person delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit
against such debt to the extent the tax related to deliveries of electricity is not collected because the charges for such electricity are
written off as uncollectible; provided that if such charges are thereafter collected by the person delivering electricity, such person
shall be obligated to remit such tax to the village. Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding
such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to such gross
charge an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the expense incurred in
keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon request. If
the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax
directly to the village in the manner prescribed by the village. The person delivering electricity who files returns pursuant to this
section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay the village the amount of the tax collected pursuant to subsection A2 of this

ordinance, are voided by court action, the previous provisions of this section in effect at the time of passage of this ordinance shall
remain in effect in all respects as if such provisions had never been amended by this ordinance, and any amounts paid to the
village by any person delivering electricity pursuant to this ordinance shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to subsection A2

the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service;
7. Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not
otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal
income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the

additional information as the village may reasonably require.
2. Issuance Of Resale Number: Upon approval of the application, the village manager, or his designee, shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The village manager, or his designee, may cancel any

such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person having discontinued the making of
resales.
3. Use Of Resale Number: Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of sending or receiving
telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the village and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any
sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.
E. Not A Replacement For Other Payments: The tax imposed by this section shall be in addition to the payment of money, or value of

will insure the solicitor and the business or organization represented by the solicitor against any injury to any person or property
during the solicitation that is causally related to an act of ordinary negligence of the solicitor or of the business or organization
represented by the solicitor. Such certificate of insurance shall name the Village as an additional insured, shall state that the
insurance policy shall not be amended or canceled during the period of the permitted solicitation, and shall reflect that at least the
following coverage has been provided:

Village recognizes that the perpetrator is the principal offender under this Section, and thus intends that every such perpetrator be
punished accordingly. The Village also recognizes, however, that graffiti must be eradicated and, therefore, that the owner or
person in control of any property or place on which graffiti has been placed, while also a victim, must be required to remove that
graffiti for his or her own good and for the protection of the safety, health, and welfare of all residents of the Village. The purpose of

specifically permitted by State of Illinois or Village code, ordinance, or regulation.
C. Graffiti Prohibited: No person shall place graffiti on any property or any place at any time. No owner or person having control of any
property or place shall allow, permit, or otherwise tolerate graffiti to be placed or to remain on that property or place.
D. Possession of Graffiti Materials Prohibited: No person shall possess any spray paint, paint, ink, marking pen containing any
nonwater soluble fluid, brush, applicator, or other tool or material for painting, drawing, marking, scratching, or etching with the

a violation of placing graffiti on any property or any place shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense.

than ten (10) days after service of the notice provided in subsection F of this section and if the owner or other person on whom
such notice was served fails to remove the graffiti described in the notice, may take all such steps as the village determines are
necessary to remove, cover, or otherwise eradicate the graffiti, including, without limitation, prosecution of an action for an
injunction requiring such owner or other person to remove the graffiti within a time period determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
All costs incurred by the village in taking any action pursuant to this subsection shall be borne by such owner or other person. If

such costs to such owner or other person, then, to the extent authorized by law, such costs shall become a lien on the subject
property and the village may perfect such lien with the DuPage or Cook County recorder of deeds, as the case may be, and take all

A. Whenever an officer witnesses a violation of any ordinance relating to vehicular standing, equipment, parking or compliance1, the

1. Advising the person that he/she has violated a specified ordinance;

settlement of the violation claim; and
3. Informing the person that: a) upon failure to so settle, a complaint will be filed in the circuit court, charging the person with the
violation; and b) that the person may appear at the police department in person within ten (10) days to request that the citation be
converted into a court complaint.
The officer shall immediately attach the ticket to the illegally stopped, standing, or parked vehicle in a place clearly visible to the
driver of the vehicle. If the driver is present, the officer may deliver the ticket directly to the driver. The fact that a vehicle is
registered in the name of a person shall be considered prima facie evidence that the person was in control of the vehicle at the
time of the violation.

(10) days of the date of the issuance of the citation, the violator may appear in person at the village police department and request
that the citation be converted for a court appearance. The village police department will then rewrite the ticket on a circuit court
form and assign it to the next available regular traffic key date of the issuing officer, and the citation will be transmitted to the circuit
court. A court complaint filed after a failure to settle shall seek a fine no greater than the amount required to settle the violation at
the time the complaint was filed.
D. The payment shall be made in accordance with the instructions contained in the citation. The staff person processing the payment
will issue a receipt and promptly remit the amount to the village treasurer to be credited to the proper municipal fund. If transmitted

by mail, payment shall be deemed to be received on the date of the postmark.
E. If the violator fails to seek to convert the citation to a court appearance and fails to settle and pay the violation claim within the
prescribed time under section 6-11-5 of this chapter, then the officer is authorized to cause a notice to appear to be served upon the
violator and is authorized to file a complaint and to prosecute the complaint in the circuit court. (Ord. O2006-38, 6-6-2006)

of any Village ordinance relating to the eligible vehicle.

pending immobilization and confirming that the subject vehicle is an eligible vehicle subject to immobilization pursuant to this
Chapter, or b) revoking the notice of pending immobilization. The Police Chief shall deliver a copy of his or her decision to the
registered owner within forty eight (48) hours after the conclusion of the pre-immobilization hearing. The decision of the Police
Chief on a pre-immobilization appeal shall be final.

vehicle is an eligible vehicle subject to immobilization pursuant to this Chapter, then the Police Chief shall place the eligible
vehicle's registration number on the vehicle immobilization list; provided, however, that the eligible vehicle shall not be placed on
the vehicle immobilization list if, within three (3) days after receipt of the Police Chief's decision, the registered owner of the

fabric and anchored into the existing pavement using no. 5 x 18 inch dowel rods, thirty six inches (36") on center. If the existing
pavement is bituminous asphalt, the patch shall be composed of eight inches (8") of concrete reinforced with 6 x 6-no. 10 x no. 10 wire
fabric. The top of the concrete shall be depressed two inches (2") to allow for a bituminous concrete surface course which shall be
placed and compacted level with the existing pavement surface. If the base construction is bituminous concrete, then the full depth of
the patch must be replaced with bituminous concrete in compacted layers.
Any openings in a paved area of a street shall be repaired and the surface relaid by the permittee in compliance with this chapter and
subject to the supervision of the director of public services. If such work is not done within thirty (30) days after restoration is possible,

4. Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in
the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from
the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee
by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the
security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to
the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all
offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other
applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall
become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as
a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village,
whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said
security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a
double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-

(dbh) that is not less than the total dbh of the trees being removed. The replacement trees shall each be not less than three inches
(3") dbh, of species approved by the Village, and planted at locations approved by the Village. (Ord. O2007-73, 11-6-2007)
J. Distributed Antenna Systems And Small Cell Facilities:
1. Collocation; Existing Poles: All equipment related to a distributed antenna system or small cell facility shall be
mounted/collocated on existing poles or other existing structures unless it can be shown by the applicant either that a new pole is
required in order for the system or facility to function effectively or that an alternate location will be less obtrusive and/or more
beneficial to the public. Equipment may be housed in a cabinet at ground level only with the approval of the Village as to location
and with appropriate screening. The design of any new pole requested shall be subject to approval by the Village Board.
2. Visual Impact: An applicant seeking installation of a distributed antenna system or small cell facility must demonstrate that it has
made efforts to blend or camouflage the system or facility with existing facilities and surroundings or has otherwise screened or
concealed the system or facility from view. Approved blending methods include, but are not limited to, location of equipment other
than antennas within a tree canopy or other inconspicuous location, use of green, brown or other colored equipment (if
commercially available to the applicant) designed to mimic the colors and/or materials of the tree canopy, collocation structure or
other environmental features or nearby structures, as well as use of textures and shapes as appropriate, all with the intent of
minimizing the visual impact of the system or facility. Unnatural colors and exposed cables are prohibited.
3. Minimum Height: All pole mounted distributed antenna systems or small cell facilities shall be installed at a minimum height of
nine feet (9') above the ground. Equipment may be housed in a cabinet at ground level only with the approval of the Village as to

limitations in subsection A5 of this section. Equipment enclosures shall not be oversized based on anticipated future needs
unless specifically approved by the Village.
6. Residential Placements: Where distributed antenna systems or small cell facilities are placed in residential or Design Overlay
Districts, every effort shall be made to avoid placement at right-of-way locations directly in front of a residence. If placement
directly in front of a residence is absolutely necessary for technological reasons, the Village has the right to require screening or
impose other design mitigation requirements.
7. Alternative Locations: The Village may request that a particular node or nodes be placed in an alternative location to that
proposed by the applicant. Where a request for an alternative location is unable to be accommodated by an applicant, the
applicant shall supply an explanation in writing as to why the suggested alternative location will materially compromise the
functioning of the system or facility or is otherwise impractical. (Ord. O2017-26, 6-13-2017)

No building permit shall be issued until the water service fee therefor has been paid to the village as provided in section 9-1-4 of this
code, covering use of unmetered water during construction. The director of public services, in his or her sole discretion, may require
installation of a temporary outside meter to measure water used during construction if he or she determines that such water use may
be greater than that typically used during construction operations in the village. The installation of such temporary outside meter shall
not relieve the building permit applicant of the duty to pay the water service fee. Water measured by any such temporary outside meter
shall be paid for at the village's regular metered water rates. (Ord., 7-19-1988)
7-4F-6: LIEN; NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY2:
Whenever a bill for water service remains unpaid thirty (30) days after it has been rendered, the village attorney shall file with the
county recorder of deeds of DuPage County, if the property is situated in DuPage County or with the county recorder of deeds of Cook
County if the property is situated in Cook County, a statement of lien claim.
This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village
claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges for water subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
If the consumer of water whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises, the village attorney, if he has notice of this, shall mail or
have mailed a notice to the owner of the premises, if his address be known to the attorney, whenever such bill remains unpaid for a
period of thirty (30) days after it has been rendered.
The failure of the village attorney to record such lien claim or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall
not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid water bills as mentioned in the following section. (Ord., 8-26-1966)
7-4F-7: FORECLOSURE OF LIEN:
Property subject to a lien for unpaid water charges shall be sold for nonpayment of same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied
to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity
in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the
village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which the bill for water has remained unpaid thirty
(30) days after it has been rendered. (Ord., 8-2-1966)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 336/605
A. Cash Escrow Required; Purposes: It shall be unlawful for any person to commence any excavation or construction work in the
village for which a village permit is required (the "work") unless the owner, general contractor, or other person doing such work
(collectively and severally referred to as the "principal"), first shall have deposited in escrow with the village cash or a letter of credit
(the "escrow") in the amount hereinafter specified. The escrow shall be held by the village for the purposes of:
1. Indemnifying the village against any damage done by the principal, by any subcontractor of the principal or by the work to any
village property, structure, equipment, or facility; and
2. When the work includes the making of any excavation, ensuring that the excavation portion of the work will be completed within
six (6) months after the date of its commencement and ensuring that all portions of the excavation not occupied by structures
completed as of that date will be refilled and ensuring that the surface will be restored to its original condition by that date.
B. Amount Of Escrow: The principal shall deposit with the village, for the escrow, an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the work
value or five hundred dollars ($500.00), whichever is more, provided, however, that the required escrow shall not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00). The building commissioner shall have the discretion to require additional escrow above ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) where the village engineer determines that there is likelihood that the cost of restoration of public
streets or ways shall exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) due to the work. All letters of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to
the village attorney, and the right to draw on any such letter of credit shall be subject to no condition other than the village's
submission of its written statement stating that: 1) the village has determined that a drawing is necessary to satisfy an indemnity
obligation arising under this section or 2) the letter of credit will expire in less than thirty (30) days and has not been renewed. (Ord.
O2009-42, 8-11-2009)
C. Duration Of Escrow: The escrow shall be held by the village for the purposes stated in subsection A of this section until the work is
fully completed and a certificate of occupancy or other final approval for the work has been issued; provided, however, that the
escrow may be held for up to twenty four (24) months after such date in any case where the village manager determines that
damage caused or threatened by the work may not be fully manifested or known by such date.
D. Village Claims Against Escrow:
1. Village Right To Draw On Escrow: On a determination by the village building commissioner of damage to any village property,
structure, equipment, or facility as described in subsection A1 of this section or of failure to complete the work or to make such
restoration as described in subsection A2 of this section, the village may, subject to the provisions of subsection D2 of this
section, take all necessary actions to repair, or to cause the repair of, such damage, or to make, or to cause to be made, such
restoration and may draw on any part of or all of any escrow for all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith.
2. Notice; Hearing; Determination: Except in cases of imminent threat of injury to persons or damage to property, no action
pursuant to subsection D1 of this section shall be taken by the village except after notice to the principal served personally or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, five (5) days in advance thereof. In case of such imminent threat, the village may act
immediately as necessary to eliminate such threat and shall give the notice herein required as soon thereafter as reasonably
possible. Where more than one person constitutes the principal, notice to the person or persons that signed the building or other
permit application shall be sufficient. Such notice shall describe generally the damage to be repaired or the restoration to be
completed and shall advise the principal of the right to a hearing as provided in this subsection D2 to contest the principal's
responsibility for such damage or restoration. The principal shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to request, in
writing, a hearing before the village manager or his designee. On such request, the village manager or his designee shall
conduct an informal hearing designed to obtain all relevant information and shall make a written determination thereon and
provide a copy of such determination to the principal personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If no request by the
principal for a hearing is received by the village, or if the village manager or his designee determines after conducting a hearing
that the village has the right to take action pursuant to subsection D1 of this section, and if the principal has not, either within the
time provided for requesting such hearing or within five (5) days after receiving the determination of such hearing, either taken
the necessary action or entered into a binding agreement satisfactory to the village manager to take such action with all
deliberate speed, then the village may proceed to take action pursuant to subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-
2008)
E. Other Remedies:
1. Street Openings: In the case of any damage to any village property, structure, equipment, or facility as described in subsection
A1 of this section by any principal which has deposited a cash bond pursuant to subsection B of this section, the principal: a)
shall not be permitted to undertake any additional street openings in the village, or to be issued a permit therefor, until all
necessary repairs and restoration are completed and all costs and expenses in connection therewith paid by that principal and b)
shall, for a period of three (3) years after completion of such repairs or restoration, deposit with the village, for the escrow, cash in
the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each street opening.
2. General: The village may, in addition to drawing on the escrow pursuant to subsection D of this section and in addition to the
remedies in subsection E1 of this section, take any and all additional actions that may be available to enforce all applicable
provisions of this code and to recover any damages done by the principal or by any subcontractor of the principal or by the work.
The escrow provided herein is in addition to any other such actions and shall not be construed as a limit on the amount of

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 337/605
damages that may be recovered by the village or any other person or on any other remedy or penalty provided by this code or
otherwise by law. (Ord. O2009-33, 5-19-2009)
F. Replenishment Of Escrow: Any amount withdrawn from the escrow pursuant to this section shall be replenished by the principal
within ten (10) days following such withdrawal. The failure of the principal to so replenish the escrow shall be a violation of this code
and grounds for revocation of any permit or approval authorizing the work and for issuance of an order stopping the work.
G. Return Of Escrow; No Interest: Provided that no notice given pursuant to subsection D2 of this section remains unresolved, any
amount remaining in any escrow as of the date specified in subsection C of this section shall be returned to the principal from which
it was received within thirty (30) days after such date. No interest shall be paid on any escrow.
H. Permit Condition: Every permit authorizing any work shall be deemed to be conditioned upon the principal's acceptance of, and
agreement to abide by, the provisions of this section. Commencement of the work pursuant to any such permit shall be deemed to
be the principal's acknowledgment and acceptance of such condition whether or not such condition is expressly stated on such
permit.
I. Escrows Under Prior Ordinances: The amount of any escrow established pursuant to this section as it existed prior to the effective
date of this section shall be adjusted to the amount required by this section and as adjusted, shall be held pursuant to the terms of
this section. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-12-2008)
J. Insurance: No permit shall be issued unless the principal has filed with the building commissioner an insurance certificate evidencing
a valid comprehensive general liability insurance policy, with an insurance company approved by the village, which holds the village
harmless for personal injury and property damage coverage that may result or accrue from or become of the making, existence or
manner of work performed pursuant to said permit. Said certificate shall show the village as party to the insured in an amount not
less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for each occurrence. (Ord. O2009-33, 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. O2015-51, 12-8-2015)

commissioner is hereby empowered to make such inspections, examinations, and tests as may be necessary to see to the
enforcement of these provisions.
A reinspection fee shall be charged for each time, after the village building department has been notified that a building or structure or
other work is ready for said inspections, examinations, or tests as required, that the Building Department, for reason that either the
property owner or contractor was not on the job site or the job in fact was not ready for the called inspection, was unable to make the
inspection. This fee must be paid prior to the final inspection, approval, or occupancy of the building or structure. (Ord. O2008-46, 8-
12-2008)

removed not less than five (5) days after it was issued and only after correction of all violations throughout the construction site,
demonstration in writing to the building commissioner of implementation of proper site management techniques, and payment of
the administrative removal fee.

e. Within ten feet (10') of and parallel to a lot line abutting the Illinois Tri-State Toll Road, Route 83, 55th Street, or Ogden Avenue
rights of way: Eight feet (8').
f. When a front yard fence is: 1) open (greater than 1/3 of the total fence contour); and 2) constructed of cast aluminum or
wrought iron; and 3) the property on which the fence is located has a front lot line with a width of not less than one hundred
twenty five feet (125'), and a total lot area not less than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet: Five feet (5').

a. Chainlink fences wherever located: Four feet (4').
b. Any fence governed by the provisions of section 7-1D-4 or 7-1D-5 of this code: Two feet (2').
c. Any post or other principal vertical support component: Six inches (6") above maximum height.
F. Measurement Of Height: The height of all fences shall be measured from the existing natural grade on which the fence is located, as
determined by the building commissioner, to the top of the fence. For front yard fences in residential districts and lots used for
residential purposes, the building commissioner has the authority to administratively approve up to twelve inches (12") of additional
height in order to accommodate changes in grade.
G. Maintenance: All fences shall be maintained in good condition.
H. Prohibited Fences: Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, the following prohibitions apply to all fences in the

3. No "solid fence", as defined herein, shall be permitted that exceeds twenty four inches (24") in height as measured from the
natural grade in any front yard or any corner side yard. A "solid fence" is a fence in which the open spaces, when viewed at a
right angle to the vertical fence plane, constitute less than one-third (1/3) of the total fence contour. The "total fence contour" is
the entire square foot area within and between the outside vertical outline of the fence. The "open spaces" are areas within the
"total fence contour", which, when viewed at right angles to the vertical fence plane, allow clear visibility through said fence
plane.

this section insofar as such requirements relate to chainlink fences; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any
fence be permitted under this subsection on a lot zoned in the residence districts of the Hinsdale zoning ordinance which is used
for residential purposes except in conformance with all the requirements of this section. The zoning board of appeals shall approve
such petition only upon the finding that: 1) the fence is justified in light of the seriousness of the risk posed to the safety of persons
and the fence will mitigate that risk; 2) the fence will not alter the essential character of the locality; 3) the fence will be in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of this section; 4) the fence will set no unfavorable precedent either to the locality or to the
village as a whole; 5) the fence will be the minimum size and type necessary to accomplish its intended purpose; and 6) the fence
will not adversely affect the public safety and general welfare.
J. Variations: Any person may petition to the zoning board of appeals for a variation from the provisions of this section. A petition for a
variation shall include the following information: name, address, and telephone number of petitioner; a description of the requested
variation; a site plan, drawn to scale, depicting the proposed fence and showing its location in relation to the lot lines of the lot on
which the fence is placed, any structures on said lot, and all adjacent properties; existing elevations in the area in which the fence
is placed and any proposed grade changes in said area; and such additional information as the plan commission may require. The
plan commission shall recommend, and the board of trustees shall grant, a variation from the provisions of this section only upon
finding that: 1) the petitioner is affected by unique circumstances justifying relief from the provisions of this section, 2) the variation
will not alter the essential character of the locality, 3) the variation will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
section, 4) the variation will set no unfavorable precedent either to the locality or to the village as a whole, 5) the variation will be
the minimum necessary to afford relief to the petitioner, and 6) the variation will not adversely affect the public safety and general
welfare. Every grant of a variation shall be based on written findings of fact evidencing compliance with the foregoing standards
and specifying the reasons for granting the variation.
K. Nonconforming Fences: All fences heretofore lawfully constructed and not in conformity with the provisions of this section shall be
deemed nonconforming fences and may exist and may be maintained; provided, however, that no such maintenance shall expand
any existing nonconformity or create any new nonconformity. No nonconforming fence shall be enlarged or extended in any manner
except in accordance with the provisions of this section.
L. Swimming Pools: Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter or limit the provisions of the international residential code related
to fences designed to enclose swimming pools.

(Ord., 2-3-1976; amd. Ord., 3-7-1978)
Where existing rights of way of abutting streets are greater than above standards, then such existing right-of-way widths may be used.
B. Easements: Where no alleys are provided, easements for the installation and maintenance of all overhead or underground utility
services including electric, telephone, gas, water and sewage services, shall be dedicated upon the subdivision plat. Said
easements shall be not less than ten feet (10') in width and shall be centered on the rear lot lines as far as possible, or in such
other locations as the enforcing officer and the Plan Commission may approve, and shall be so laid out as to provide continuity of
such public utility services from block to block.
C. Setback Lines: For all subdivisions, setback lines, if any, shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Village's Zoning
Ordinance.
D. Block Sizes: In all subdivisions, blocks shall not be more than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') long nor less than two
hundred fifty feet (250') wide. (Ord., 2-3-1976)
E. Zoning Regulations: The proposed subdivision shall conform to all applicable requirements of the Hinsdale zoning code, including,
without limitation, the regulations related to minimum lot areas and dimensions. (Ord., 4-25-1989)
F. Large Lots Or Tracts: Any owner wishing to subdivide the property into lots or tracks of an exceptionally large size shall plat the
same in such manner that any future streets that may be anticipated can be laid out along lot lines. The Plan Commission may
reserve the right to require easements for such streets to be shown and dedicated on such subdivision. (Ord., 2-3-1976)
G. Land Dedication And Contribution Standards:
1. General Requirement:
a. Condition Of Subdivision Approval: As a condition of approval of a final plat for any subdivision that is located, entirely or in
part, within a residential district or that is, or is intended to be, used, entirely or in part, for residential purposes, the subdivider
shall be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents
of the proposed subdivision, or to provide a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of

land and cash contributions, at the option of the Village, in accordance with this subsection G; provided, however, that no land
dedication or cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for the first fifteen (15) persons of any net increase in ultimate
population in any subdivision as calculated pursuant to this subsection G. Land shall not be artificially subdivided so as to
avoid dedication of the full amount of land or payment of the full cash contribution in lieu of land dedication otherwise required
pursuant to this subsection G.
b. Aggregation Of Multiple Subdivisions: Two (2) or more subdivisions that are represented by their subdividers to be separate
subdivisions shall be aggregated and treated as a single subdivision under this subsection G when they are determined to be
part of a unified plan of development and are physically proximate to each other. Two (2) or more subdivisions shall be treated
as a unified plan of development if one or more of the following standards apply:
(1) Common Ownership Or Control: Two (2) or more of the following standards are met:
(A) The same person or persons has retained or shared control of the land in the subdivision within a period of twenty (20)
years prior to the date of submission of an application for subdivision approval but not including any period prior to January
1, 1999;
(B) The same person or persons has ownership or a significant legal, beneficial or equitable interest in the land in the
subdivision or in the development within a period of twenty (20) years prior to the date of submission of an application for
subdivision approval but not including any period prior to January 1, 1999; or
(C) There is common management of the subdivisions controlling the form of physical development or disposition of parcels
in the development.
(2) Closeness In Time Of Development: A reasonable closeness in time between the completion of eighty percent (80%) or
less of one subdivision and the submission to the Village or other entity with jurisdiction of a tentative subdivision plan or
application for zoning relief for the other subdivision or subdivisions.
(3) Shared Infrastructure: The sharing of infrastructure between or among the subdivisions, such as streets, sidewalks,
sanitary sewers, water mains, or storm sewers and drainage systems.
(4) Common Sales Efforts: A common advertising scheme or promotional plan is used for the subdivisions sought to be
aggregated.
c. Condition Of Occupancy Permit: No occupancy permit shall be issued for any structure on the land in the subdivision until such
conveyance or contribution has been acknowledged and received by the Village Manager.
2. Density Formula:
a. Population Table: The Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, set forth in this Section as Table 11-1, shall be
used as provided in this subsection G to calculate the required dedication of land for park and recreational purposes or for
cash contributions in lieu thereof, unless a written objection thereto is filed by the subdivider with the Village Manager pursuant
to subsection G2c of this Section.

Note: The determination of the number of bedrooms contained in a building shall be made by the Village Manager. Rooms designated
by a subdivider as "den", "library", "study", "sewing room", "exercise room", or the like may be designated by the Village Manager as
bedrooms if they are suitable for such accommodations.
b. Presumed Density Formula: In applying Table 11-1 of this Section to a proposed subdivision for which the types of units and
number of bedrooms cannot reasonably be determined from the data and materials on file with the Village, the following types
of units and bedroom data shall be used, unless a written objection thereto is filed by the subdivider with the village manager
pursuant to subsection G2c of this section:
Single-family attached: Equal mix of 2 and 3 bedroom units at maximum unit density permitted by
applicable zoning.
Multiple-family dwellings in the R-5 and R-6
districts:
Equal mix of 2 and 3 bedroom units at maximum unit density permitted by
applicable zoning.
c. Objection To Density Formulas: If the subdivider files a written objection with the village manager to the use of table 11-1 of this
section or the presumed density formula set forth in subsection G2b of this section, the subdivider shall submit, at the
subdivider's sole cost and expense, a thorough and comprehensive demographic study showing the estimated population to
be generated by the proposed subdivision. The village board shall make the final determination as to the density formula and
estimated population that shall apply to the proposed subdivision, which final decision shall be based on the demographic
study submitted by the subdivider and all other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue as determined and required by
the village board. Nothing in this subsection G2c shall be construed as limiting or preventing the village board from utilizing
table 11-1 of this section or the presumed density formula set forth in subsection G2b of this section for any proposed
subdivision. (Ord. O99-19, 4-20-1999)
3. Criteria For Park Land Dedication:
a. Calculation Of Land Required To Be Dedicated: The amount of land required to be dedicated for park and recreational
purposes for a proposed subdivision shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of that subdivision. The
requirement shall be based on a standard of fifteen (15) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) net increase in ultimate
population, computed in accordance with subsection G2 and table 11-1 of this section. (Ord. O2004-55, 11-16-2004)
b. Location Of Land To Be Dedicated: The location of the land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes for the
proposed subdivision pursuant to this subsection G shall be determined by the village board after receipt of a recommendation
by the plan commission. The determination shall be based on such factors as the plan commission and the village board shall
deem appropriate, including specifically, but without limitation, the availability of land, the suitability of any particular land for
park and recreational purposes as opposed to use for other development, the location of the land relative to population
concentrations, and the proximity of the land to other park or recreational lands.
c. Minimum Size Of Dedicated Land: The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be
ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area and no dimension shall be less than one hundred feet (100'); provided, however, that
the plan commission may recommend and the village board may approve dedications of a smaller size or dimension when
required by the specific plans of the proposed subdivision and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and
recreational purposes is clearly demonstrated. Nothing in this subsection G3c shall require the dedication of any land in excess
of the amount otherwise required by subsection G3a of this section.
d. On Site Storage Prohibited: No materials or equipment, including, without limitation, topsoil or other soil materials, shall be
stored on any land that has been dedicated, or that has been designated for dedication, to the village for park or recreational
purposes pursuant to this subsection G without the express prior written consent of the village.
e. Detention And Retention Areas Not Qualified: No storm water detention or retention area shall qualify as land suitable for
dedication for park and recreational purposes, unless the suitability of such land for park and recreational purposes as a
secondary use is clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the village board.
f. Private Common Open Space And Recreational Areas:
(1) When private open space is made permanently available for use on an equal and common basis to every resident in the
proposed subdivision at a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, and such open space is specifically intended and
designed to meet the recreational needs of the subdivision and is depicted on the final plat for the proposed subdivision and
recorded against the subject property ("private common open space"), then a one hundred percent (100%) credit toward the
park land dedication requirement of this subsection shall be allowed to the extent of such private common open space.
(2) If the total acreage of private common open space for the proposed subdivision equals the total acreage required to be
dedicated for park and recreational purposes pursuant to this subsection, then such requirement shall be deemed to have
been fulfilled by the provision of such private common open space.
(3) If the private common open space for the proposed subdivision is not adequately or property maintained, at any time, to the
satisfaction of the Village Board, or if such private common open space is not made available for use on an equal and
common basis to every resident in the subdivision at a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, or ceases to be
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 382/605
made so available for use on such basis, then the private common open space shall be dedicated by the owner to the public
for public park and recreational purposes upon direction by the Village Board, in the form of a resolution or ordinance duly
adopted, that such a dedication be made.
(4) Prior to approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall prepare and record covenants establishing the provisions of this
subsection G3f, which covenants shall be duly executed by all owners of the land and all mortgage holders, if any, and
delivered to the Village for recording. Each such covenant shall recite that it shall be enforceable by suit in equity brought by
the Village, its successors, if any, or by any interested person.
4. Criteria For Payment In Lieu Of Land Dedication:
a. General Qualification: In the event that a proposed subdivision is small and the resulting required land dedication is too small,
in the determination of the Village Board, to be practical, or when the Village Board finds that the available land is inappropriate
for park and recreational purposes, then the Village shall have the authority to require the subdivider to pay a cash contribution
in lieu of the otherwise required land dedications, in accordance with the standards of this subsection G4.
b. Definition Of Fair-Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair-market value of the acres of
land in the proposed subdivision, which fair-market value shall be determined by an appraiser hired by the Village. The
Village's expenses related to the hiring of an appraiser for the purposes of determining the fair-market value shall be
reimbursed to the Village by the subdivider.
c. Objection To Fair-Market Value Determination: If the subdivider or any other affected person files a written objection with the
Village Manager to the fair-market value as established pursuant to subsection G4b of this Section, the subdivider or other
affected person shall submit, at his or her sole cost and expense, a written appraisal professionally prepared by a Member of
the Appraisal Institute of America (MAI). The appraisal shall show the fair market value of improved land in the area of the
proposed subdivision. The Village Board shall make the final determination as to the fair market value of such improved land,
which final determination shall be based on the appraisal or other information submitted by the subdivider or other affected
person involved, and any response thereto filed by the subdivider or other affected person, and all other facts and
circumstances relevant to the issue as determined and required by the Village Board. Nothing in this subsection G4c shall be
construed as limiting or preventing the Village Board from utilizing the fair-market value as established in subsection G4b of
this Section for any proposed subdivision.
d. Disposition Of Cash Contributions:
(1) Cash contributions in lieu of park land dedications shall be held in trust by the Village, or other public body designated by
the Village, solely for use in the acquisition or development of park and recreational land to serve the immediate or future
needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreational sites.
(2) Funds held in trust shall be kept separate from all other funds and shall be accounted for in the appropriate manner.
e. Refund Of Cash Contributions: If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of a park land dedication is not expended for the
purposes set forth herein within seven (7) years after the date of receipt of such contribution by the Village, then that cash
contribution shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contribution, or its successor or assign.
5. Criteria For Combination Land Dedication And Cash Payment: A combination of land dedication and cash contribution in lieu of
land dedication may be required when appropriate as determined by the Village Board, including, without limitation, in the
following two (2) circumstances:
a. Inadequate Land: The proposed subdivision has some but not enough adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of
this subsection. That portion of the land within the proposed subdivision that is adequate for park land shall be dedicated as
provided in this subsection, and a cash contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to
be dedicated pursuant to this subsection.
b. Previous Acquisition: A major part of the local park or recreational site already has been acquired and only a small parcel of
land is needed from the proposed subdivision to complete the site. Such parcel shall be acquired by dedication, and a cash
contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this
subsection.
6. Reservation Of Additional Land: When the Village's Official Comprehensive Plan or other applicable standard of the Village
requires a larger amount of park and recreational land in a particular subdivision than the subdivider is otherwise required to
dedicate pursuant to the terms of this subsection, then the land needed in excess of the otherwise required dedication shall be
reserved by the subdivider for subsequent purchase by the Village or other public body designated by the Village, provided that
such acquisition is started within one year after the date of approval of the final plat for the proposed subdivision.
7. Combining With Adjoining Subdivisions: For proposed subdivisions of forty (40) acres or less, the otherwise applicable park and
recreational land dedication may be combined, where practical as determined by the Village Board, with dedications for the same
purposes from adjoining subdivisions or developments to produce usable park or recreational areas.
8. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography, and geology of a site to be dedicated pursuant to the requirements of this
subsection, as well as its surroundings, shall be suitable for the intended purpose of the site. Grading on dedicated land shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land. No removal of existing topsoil shall be permitted.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 383/605
9. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, telecommunications, gas, water,
sewer and streets (including curb and gutter and enclosed drainage), as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable
provisions shall be made therefor.
10. Dedication Required As Part Of Annexation Agreement: Unless waived by the Village Board in its sole and absolute discretion,
the dedication of land, or cash contributions in lieu thereof, required by this subsection also shall be required as a condition of the
annexation of any land to the Village for residential purposes. However, the same shall not be required as condition to an
amendment of an annexation agreement unless the Village Board finds from a consideration of the purposes of this subsection
that such dedications or payments should be required because of increased burdens to be placed on the park system over and
above those covered by the dedications and cash contributions made or provided for in connection with the original annexation
agreement. If the Village Board does so find, then additional dedications or cash contributions shall be required, but only to the
extent necessary to cover the shortage resulting from such increased burdens. Dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu
thereof as specified in any annexation agreement that substantially comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be
deemed to have fulfilled the dedication requirements of this subsection.
11. Dedication At Time Of Approval Of Final Plat: Approval of any final plat of subdivision shall be conditioned on the dedication of
land, or cash donations in lieu thereof, as required by this subsection. When a subdivision is to be developed over a period of
years, dedication of required land may be made after completion of a portion of the subdivision provided that an escrow fund
satisfactory to the Village has been established to guarantee the conveyance of land after completion of such portion of the
subdivision.
12. Title To Dedicated Park Land:
a. General Requirement: All sites to be dedicated pursuant to this subsection shall be conveyed to the Village either by warranty
or trustee's deed, or such form of conveyance as the Village shall require. The subdivider shall be responsible for payment of
all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any agricultural rollback taxes that might be extended or levied
against such sites. In the discretion of the Village, a commitment for title insurance issued by a company authorized to do
business in Illinois may be required as evidence of clear title.
b. Park Land: Conveyance of park land dedications shall occur only after or simultaneously with the passage of an ordinance or
resolution by the Village, in which it indicates that the land will be accepted by the Village, for park purposes.
H. Lands Designated For Public Use: In addition to any lands required to be dedicated or reserved pursuant to subsection G of this
Section, all subdividers may be required to set aside a certain portion of land to be used for public purpose. The Village Board shall
proceed to acquire the land so designated by purchase, or commence proceedings to acquire by condemnation within one year
from the date of approval of the subdivision plat. If the Village Board fails to act within the one year period, the land designated for
public use may then be used by the owners in any other manner consistent with this Plan. (Ord. O99-19, 4-20-1999)
11-1-13: PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
The following improvements will be required for all subdivisions under the jurisdiction of this Plan. (Ord., 2-3-1976)
A. Pavement, Curbs, Gutters: On both sides of all unimproved streets located wholly or partially within a subdivision and abutting said
subdivision, the subdivider shall install at his own expense combination concrete curb and gutter and pavement. Plans and profiles

The subdivider shall submit a tree planting plan to the enforcing officer for approval prior to approval of the final plat of subdivision.
Such tree planting plan shall show the location, size, and variety of each tree to be planted and of each existing tree proposed by the
subdivider to be used in lieu of the planting of a new tree. All trees used to fulfill the requirements of this subsection C shall be not less
than two inches (2") trunk diameter in size, measured at fifty four inches (54") above ground level ("diameter at breast height"). (3-15-
94)
D. Street Name Signs: The Village will order and install one street sign at all new intersections created by such subdivision. The
subdivider shall reimburse the Village for all expenses associated with the above.
E. Water Supply: The water system of the Village shall be extended throughout or adjacent to the entire subdivision by the subdivider,
at his own expense, in such a manner that every lot in such subdivision may be serviced by means of a service connection from
water mains within the frontage or side yards of each lot. The water system must be a looped system providing two (2) independent
sources of water service. The water system shall be built in accordance with the Village's Standard Specifications for Water Main
Installation, the current edition.
F. Sanitary Sewers: The subdivider shall, at his own expense, install a complete system of sanitary sewers throughout or adjacent to

Commission approve any subdivision that does not provide for sanitary sewer service to every lot therein. Sewer systems shall be
built in accordance with Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, Second Edition, November
1973, as amended from time to time, which are made part of this Plan by reference.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 385/605
G. Storm Sewers: The Plan Commission shall require the installation of a storm sewer system by the subdivider at his own expense as
a condition for approval of the plat, which system shall be separate from any sanitary sewer system. Plans and profiles of storm
sewer systems shall be prepared in accordance with Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois as
amended from time to time, which are made a part of this Plan by reference. (2-3-76)
H. Storm water retention shall meet the requirements of Title 12 of this Code. (3-17-92)
I. Public Utilities: All public utility installations shall be underground. These public utilities shall include but are not limited to electric,

conform to the standards of the power company.
J. Approval of Plans for Improvements: All plans, specifications and contracts for public improvements inside the corporate limits
required by this Chapter shall be approved by the enforcing officer prior to installation of any of said improvements. (2-3-76)
11-1-14: INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS:
A. Appointment of Inspector: If, in the opinion of the enforcing officer, it is necessary to have the public improvement required herein
under more or less continuous inspection and supervision and requiring services beyond the normal duties of Village employees,
he may appoint a qualified person as an inspector.
B. Payment of Inspection Fees: It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to pay the actual cost of said inspector's compensation
including said inspector's direct salary and fringe benefits.
C. Method of Payment: In the event that an inspector is appointed, the enforcing officer shall require the subdivider, prior to starting
any improvements requiring inspection, to pay to the Village Collector a sum which the enforcing officer estimates will cover the
costs of said inspection. In the event the amount originally paid is not sufficient, the subdivider shall pay the additional amount
required to finish the work; or if the amount originally paid is more than required, the surplus shall be returned to the subdivider
without interest. (2-3-76)
11-1-15: VARIATIONS:
The Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may approve one or more variations from the requirements of
Sections 11-1-7, 11-1-10, 11-1-11, 11-1-12, and 11-1-13 of this Chapter for a plat of subdivision; provided, however, that no such
variation shall be granted by the Board of Trustees that would detract from or adversely affect the general plan, intent, or spirit of this
Chapter or of any building or zoning regulations applicable to the property that is the subject of such plat of subdivision. Any such
recommendation by the Plan Commission shall be made in writing and be transmitted to the Board of Trustees along with the Plan
Commission's recommendation or other action on such plat of subdivision. (10-4-88)
11-1-16: APPROVAL OF FINAL SUBDIVISION PLATS:
A. Approval by Plan Commission: After approval of a final subdivision plat by the Plan Commission, the certificate thereon denoting
said approval and date thereof shall be signed by the chairman of the Plan Commission and attested by the secretary. The
secretary shall then transmit the approved final plat to the Village Board together with a document of transmittal calling the Board's
attention to all variations (if any) approved by the Plan Commission and setting forth its reasons for approving said variations and
conveying to the Board such other information concerning the subdivision as the Plan Commission may deem necessary or
advisable. With the approved final plat, the secretary of the Plan Commission shall also transmit to the Village Board the
subdivider's agreement with respect to improvements, the approval of the enforcing officer of all said improvements, together with
plans, specifications, estimates and escrow agreements, and all other documents, certificates and papers pertaining to the final plat
and the subdivision platted thereon; except that the Village Board may waive the requirement as to receiving documents at that
time pertaining to proposed improvements as specified immediately above and approve the final plat without said documents;
provided, that all such required documents shall be delivered to the enforcing officer before the final plat is recorded. (2-3-76)
B. Approval by Board of Trustees: When the Board of Trustees is satisfied with the final plat and with all proposed improvements,
conditions, and documents as submitted pertaining to the subdivision platted therein, the Board of Trustees shall approve the final
plat and authorize and direct the Village President and the Village Clerk to sign the "approved" certificate on the final plat, including
the date of such signature, and to affix the Village Seal thereto. The Board of Trustees' approval of the final plat may be subject to
appropriate conditions that must be fulfilled prior to the recording of the final plat, such as, without limitation, submission by the
subdivider of cash as required by Section 11-1-11 of this Code to ensure the proper installation of all public improvements attendant
to the subdivision. Before the Village Clerk shall sign or affix the Village Seal to the final plat, the subdivider shall fulfill all conditions
imposed by the Board of Trustees on the approval of the final plat and, in addition, shall pay to the Village Clerk the fee of twenty
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 386/605
dollars ($20.00) for each of the first five (5) lots platted on the final plat and five dollars ($5.00) for each lot in excess of five (5) lots,
but in no event shall the total fee be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). Such fee shall be in addition to the recording fees required
pursuant to subsection C of this Section.
C. Recording of Plat; Fees; Time Limit: The Village Clerk shall retain each approved final plat until the subdivider has 1) fulfilled all
conditions imposed by the Board of Trustees on the approval of the final plat, and 2) submitted to the Village cash to ensure the
proper installation of all public improvements attendant to the subdivision as required by Section 11-1-11 of this Title, and 3)
deposited all escrow funds, inspection fees, and other materials and documents that may be required with the final plat, and 4) paid
the fee provided in subsection B of this Section, and 5) paid to the Village Clerk a sum estimated by the Village Clerk to be the cost
of recording the final plat. The Village Clerk shall cause the final plat to be recorded, but only after all such requirements have been
fulfilled. The original final plat shall be retained permanently in the Village's files. No final plat approval shall be valid for a period
longer than one year unless all conditions attached to such final plat approval have been fulfilled and the final plat has been
recorded. (3-15-94)
D. Conflict of Jurisdiction: The Plan Commission claims full jurisdiction over platting of subdivisions and improvements thereon on all
subdivisions outside the Village limits, except as modified herein, within the boundaries described in section 10 of the Plan.
However, in the matter of water supply and sewage disposal for individual lots or subdivisions as a whole where it is not feasible to
supply such lots or subdivisions with water or sewage service from existing public water or sewage systems, the said Plan
Commission waives jurisdiction over such water and sewer installations in favor of control of same by the county in which located.
The enforcing officer shall notify the proper county authorities in such circumstances. (2-3-76)

of Deeds. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-6: CONSENT OF OWNERS OF RECORD IN PROPOSED HISTORIC DISTRICT:
A. Manner Of Consent: In the event that the Commission makes a preliminary recommendation that an historic district should be
designated and that notice shall be given in accordance with subsection 14-3-4C of this Chapter, the notice shall include one or
more written forms on which the owners of record of each site within the proposed district may indicate their ownership and
whether or not they consent to the designation of the proposed district. If a site is owned by more than one owner of record, only
one consent form may be submitted for that site. The forms for such consent shall be prepared in a manner that enables the Village
to verify whether the person submitting the consent form is the owner of record while keeping the owner's name separate from the
owner's indication of whether or not the owner consents to the designation.
B. Effect Of Consent: No historic district shall be designated by the Village without affirmative written consent to such designation by
the owners of record of more than fifty percent (50%) of the sites within the proposed district. However, the Village shall not be
required to designate any proposed district because of the affirmative written consent to such designation by the owners of record
of more than fifty percent (50%) of the sites within the proposed district. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-7: DENIAL OF DESIGNATION:
An applicant whose nomination for a landmark or historic district designation is denied by the Village Board may request
reconsideration by filing a written request within thirty (30) days after a decision denying designation is rendered; provided, however,
that the Village Board shall reconsider a nomination only if substantial new evidence or information regarding the nominated landmark
or historic district is provided. Once a nomination has been denied by the Village Board, no further nominations involving substantially
the same relief under this Chapter for any structure, building, site, or area whose designation was denied may be filed for ninety (90)
days; provided, however, that this period does not apply to an application to designate a landmark within an area for which historic
district designation was denied. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)

14-3-8: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:
No building, demolition, sign, or other permit shall be issued for a proposed landmark or a structure, building, site, or area in a
proposed historic district from the date when the nomination form is filed with the Village Manager until the final disposition of the
nomination unless the process for certificate of appropriateness review required by Chapter 5 of this Title is completed. (Ord. O2000-7,
4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-9: LANDMARK DESIGNATION CONTROLS:
In the event that a building, structure, or site has been designated as both a landmark and as part of an historic district, the
requirements, limitations, restrictions, and regulations contained in this Title pertaining to landmarks shall control over the
requirements, limitations, restrictions, and regulations pertaining to historic districts, including, without limitation, the requirements
contained in Chapter 5 of this Title regarding the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-3-10: SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS:
A. Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred: Whenever any application filed pursuant to this Chapter has been finally denied
on its merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the same form or on the same theory, shall
not be brought unless in the opinion of the Village Manager or the Commission there is substantial new evidence available or a
mistake of law or fact significantly affected the prior denial.
B. New Grounds To Be Stated: Any such second application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration
of such application.
C. Summary Denial With Or Without Hearing: Any such second application may be denied by the Village Manager summarily, and
without hearing, on a finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such application is set for
hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to being
allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for
such failure.
D. Exception: Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second application filed more than two (2) years after the final denial
of a prior application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had been filed. The applicant shall, however, be
required to place in the record all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have developed since the
denial of the first application. In the absence of such evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)

appropriate conditions to advance the purpose and goals of this title. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)
14-5-2: CRITERIA:
All applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the applicable standards in this section.
A. General Standards:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 440/605
1. Alterations that do not affect any essential architectural or historic features of a structure or building as viewed from a public or
private street ordinarily should be permitted.
2. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure, building, or site and its environment should not be destroyed. No
alteration or demolition of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should be permitted except when necessary to
assure an economically viable use of a site.
3. All structures, buildings, sites, and areas should be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical
basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance than the true age of the property are discouraged.
4. Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a structure, building, or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance should be
recognized and respected when dealing with a specific architectural period.
5. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a structure, building, site, or area should
ordinarily be maintained and preserved.
6. Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
7. The surface cleaning of structures and buildings should be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other
cleaning methods that will damage the structures and buildings should be avoided.
8. New structures or buildings, or alterations to sites should not be discouraged when such structures or alterations do not destroy
significant historical or architectural features and are compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the site,
neighborhood, or environment.
9. Whenever possible, new structures or buildings, or alterations to the existing conditions of sites should be done in such a
manner that, if such new structures or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original
structure, building, site, or area would be unimpaired.
10. Any permitted alteration or demolition should promote the purposes of this Title and general welfare of the Village and its
residents.
11. Demolition should not be permitted if a structure, building, or site is economically viable in its present condition or could be
economically viable after completion of appropriate alterations, even if demolition would permit a more profitable use of such site.
B. Design Standards:
1. Height: The height of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the height of the original landmark. The height of a
structure or building and adjacent open spaces after any proposed alteration or construction within an historic district should be
compatible with the style and character of the structure or building and with surrounding structures and buildings in an historic
district.
2. Relationship Between Mass And Open Space: The relationship between a landmark and adjacent open spaces after its
alteration should be compatible with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship between a structure or building
and adjacent open spaces after alteration within an historic district should be compatible with the relationship between
surrounding structures, buildings and adjacent open spaces within such historic district.
3. Relationship Among Height, Width And Scale: The relationship among the height, width, and scale of a landmark after alteration
should be compatible with such relationship prior to such alteration. The relationship among height, width, and scale of a
structure or building after an alteration within an historic district should be compatible with the relationship among height, width,
and scale of surrounding structures and buildings within such historic district.
4. Directional Expression: The directional expressions of a landmark after alteration, whether its vertical or horizontal positioning,
should be compatible with the directional expression of the original landmark. The directional expression of a structure or building
after alteration within an historic district should be compatible with the directional expression of surrounding structures and
buildings within such historic district.
5. Roof Shape: The roof shape of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the roof shape of the original landmark. The
roof shape of a structure, building, or object after alteration within an historic district should be compatible with the roof shape of
surrounding structures and buildings within such historic district.
6. Architectural Details, General Designs, Materials, Textures, And Colors: The architectural details, general design, materials,
textures, and colors of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the architectural details, general design, materials,
textures, and colors of the original landmark. The architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and colors of a
structure or building after alteration within an historic district should be compatible with the architectural details, general design,
materials, textures, and colors of surrounding structures and buildings within such historic district.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 441/605
7. Landscape And Appurtenances: The landscape and appurtenances, including without limitation signs, fences, accessory
structures, and pavings, of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the landscape and appurtenances of the original
landmark. The landscape and appurtenances of a structure or building after alteration within an historic district should be
compatible with the landscape and appurtenances of surrounding structures and buildings within such historic district.
8. Construction: New construction in an historic district should be compatible with the architectural styles, design standards and
streetscapes within such historic districts.
C. Additional Standards: In addition to the foregoing standards, the commission may consider the secretary of the interior's standards
for rehabilitation guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings (revised 1983), and any amendments thereto, in reviewing any
application under this section. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000, eff. 5-1-2000)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 442/605
The purpose of such review shall be to broadly acquaint the commission with the applicant's proposal and to provide the applicant
with any preliminary views or concerns that members of the commission may have at the time in the process when positions are
still flexible and adjustment is still possible and prior to the time when the applicant is required to expend the funds necessary to
prepare the complete documentation required for a formal application.
At the meeting at which the preliminary application is considered, any member of the commission may make any comments,
suggestions or recommendations regarding the preliminary application deemed necessary or appropriate by that member;
provided, however, that no recommendation shall be made, and no final or binding action shall be taken, with respect to any
preliminary application by the Commission. Any views expressed in the course of the Commission's review of any preliminary
application shall be deemed to be only preliminary and advisory and only the individual views of the member expressing them.
Nothing said or done in the course of such review shall be deemed to create, or to prejudice, any rights of the applicant or to
obligate the Commission, or any member of it, to approve or deny any formal application following full consideration thereof as
required by this Title. Applications by the Village shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection. (Ord. O2000-7, 4-18-2000,
eff. 5-1-2000)

conditions.
C. Denial: If the application is denied, the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing and shall specify the particulars in which the
application is inconsistent with the criteria applicable to this Chapter. If the Commission issues a denial of the certificate of
appropriateness, no alteration shall be permitted to proceed, and no permits shall be issued for, the proposed alteration, demolition,
signage, or any other physical modifications of, the designated landmark. If the Commission issues a denial of a certificate of
appropriateness for a structure, building, site, or area within a designated historic district, such denial is merely advisory and shall
not prohibit an applicant from proceeding with the proposed alteration, demolition, signage or any other physical modifications the
structure, building, site, or area within the historic district upon receiving all other required approvals and permits therefor.

economic return therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed forty five (45) days. During this period of
delay, the Commission shall investigate plans and make recommendations to the Village Board to allow for a reasonably beneficial
use or a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include,
without limitation, the following: a relaxation of the provisions of this Title, a reduction in real property taxes, financial assistance,

IB - Institutional Buildings District
F. Overlay districts (Article VIII)
DR - Design Review Overlay District
Sec. 2-102:Interpretation of district sequence:
A. General rule. This Code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and,
except as noted below, is based on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific purpose, to
encourage a particular type of development, and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of
development.
B. Special rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing
characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this
Code recognizes the concept of "more restrictive" and "less restrictive" districts. For this purpose, the districts established by this
Code shall be considered "more restrictive" or "less restrictive" in accordance with the following rules:
1. The R-1 District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive residential district and the R-6 District shall be deemed to be the least
restrictive residential district, and the residential districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number
increases.
2. The residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any nonresidential district except the Open Space District.
3. The business and office districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number increases.
4. The Health Services District shall be deemed to be less restrictive than the office districts.
5. The Open Space District shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any other district.
6. The Institutional Buildings District shall be deemed to be more restrictive than the office districts but less restrictive than any
residential district.
7. Overlay Districts shall not be considered in determining the restrictiveness of the underlying district.
Sec. 2-103:Zoning map:
A. Map incorporated. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Code are as shown on a map entitled
"Zoning Map of the Village of Hinsdale, Illinois," hereafter referred to as the Zoning Map, which is by this reference incorporated as
part of this Code. All notations, references, and other information shown on the Zoning Map, and all amendments thereto, shall be
as much a part of this Code as if specifically set forth and literally described herein.
B. Omitted land. It is the intent of this Code that the entire area of the Village, including all land and water areas, be included in the
districts established by this Code. Any area lying within the Village but not shown on the Zoning Map as being included in such a
district shall be deemed to be, and it is hereby, classified in the R-1 Single Family Residential District.
C. District boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown
on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
1. The district boundaries are the center lines of tollways, expressways, highways, streets, alleys, waterways, railroads, and other
rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated. When the designation of a boundary line on the Zoning Map coincides with the location
of any such right-of-way, the center line of such right-of-way shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
2. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line,
such lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
3. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
D. Maintenance and availability of official zoning map. The official copy of the Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Village Manager
and shall be available for public inspection during Village business hours at the Village Memorial Building. Any amendment to
zoning district boundaries or any change in any other information shown on the Zoning Map made by amendment to this Code shall
be indicated on the official copy of the Zoning Map.

E. Mapping of parcels affected by court decrees. Parcels of land affected by court decrees shall be shown on the Zoning Map in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection 12-106B of this Code.
F. Availability of zoning map. A revised, up-to-date copy of the Zoning Map, certified as to being inclusive of all amendments and drawn
to a convenient scale, shall be published at least once annually and made available for sale at the Village Memorial Building.
Sec. 2-104:Annexed land:
A. Annexation of land. All land annexed to the Village after the effective date of this Code shall be classified automatically upon such
annexation in the R-1 Single Family Residential District. The owner of any land proposed to be annexed to the Village shall file, with
the petition for annexation, an application for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance pursuant to Section 11-301 of this Code. In the
case of an involuntary annexation, the Village Manager shall complete the required application.
B. Application for different classification. When any land is classified pursuant to this Section, it shall remain so classified unless and
until an application to amend such classification is filed and granted pursuant to Sections 11-301 and 11-601 of this Code. Such
application may be filed prior to or contemporaneously with the annexation of the land in question.
Chapter 3
SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
Sec. 3-101:Purposes:
Four (4) zoning districts are provided for single-family residential development. The single-family residential districts blend, in
combination with the multiple-family residential districts described in article IV of this Code, to provide a reasonable range of
opportunity for the development and preservation of housing types consistent with the existing residential character of the Village.
The single-family districts provide for a limited range of housing densities consistent with the Village's established residential
neighborhoods. The R-1 and R-2 Districts allow for lower density residential use and large lot sizes. The R-3 and R-4 Districts allow for
somewhat higher density residential use and smaller lot sizes.
Taken as a whole, the single-family district regulations are intended to perpetuate the existing high quality residential character of the
Village by preserving established neighborhoods and encouraging new residential development consistent with the overall character of
the Village. Only service uses that are compatible with the single-family residential character of each zoning district are allowed in
addition to the permitted residential uses. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-102:Permitted Uses:
The following use and no other is permitted as of right in the single-family residential districts: Single-family detached dwellings. (1991
Code)
Sec. 3-103:Accessory Structures And Uses:
Accessory structures and uses are permitted in all single-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-101 of this
Code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-104:Home Occupations:
Home occupations are permitted in all single-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-102 of this Code. (1991
Code)
Sec. 3-105:Temporary Uses:
Temporary uses are permitted in all single-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-103 of this Code. (1991
Code)

subject to the issuance of a special use permit as provided in section 11-602 of this Code and subject to the additional standards
hereinafter set forth:
A. Public utility stations, subject to the following additional standards:
1.Structure Appearance And Screening: All buildings and structures either shall have exteriors which give the appearance of a
structure permitted in the district where located or shall comply with the buffer and landscape requirements applicable to
nondwelling uses abutting a residential use pursuant to subsection 9-107H of this Code.
2.Safety Fencing: All such uses shall be fenced where any hazard to the safety of human or animal life is present.
B. Planned developments, subject to the following additional standards:
1.The minimum lot area for a planned development shall be twenty (20) acres. (Ord. O2017-07, 3-7-2017)

The parking and loading requirements applicable in all single-family residential districts are set forth in sections 9-104 and 9-105 of this
Code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 3-108:Sign Regulations:
The sign regulations applicable in all single-family residential districts are set forth in section 9-106 of this Code. (1991 Code)

densely planted evergreens.
6. Platted Building Lines: See subsection 12-101F of this code.
7. Special Orientation Requirement For Through Lots: If: a) fifty percent (50%) or more of the total number of lots on a frontage are
through lots, and b) the fronts of the single-family dwellings located on fifty percent (50%) or more of the total number of through
lots on that frontage face the same frontage, then development of a single-family dwelling on a through lot on the same frontage
shall result in the front of such single-family dwelling facing the same frontage as fifty percent (50%) of the single-family dwellings
on all through lots on the same frontage.
8. Front And Corner Side Yard Adjustment On Partially Developed Frontages: When a lot has a front or corner side yard located on
a frontage in which fifty percent (50%) or more of the lots have already been developed, the front or corner side yard applicable
to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setbacks of the buildings on all of the lots on such frontage, including
the existing building on the subject lot, which if vacant for less than five (5) years, the building that previously sat on such lot shall
be included, and excluding the highest and lowest setbacks for buildings on developed lots on such frontage and all lots
containing nonresidential principal buildings or structures; provided, however, that no such front or corner side yard shall be
permitted to be less than twenty five feet (25') in the R-1 and R-2 districts and twenty feet (20') in the R-3 and R-4 districts. When
a lot has a front or corner side yard located on a frontage in which less than fifty percent (50%) of the lots have already been
developed, the front or corner side yard applicable to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setbacks of the
buildings on each of the developed lots and the required front or corner side yard in the zoning district for each of the
undeveloped lots, including the existing building on the subject lot, which if vacant for less than five (5) years, the building that
previously sat on such lot shall be included, and excluding the highest and lowest setbacks for buildings on developed lots on
such frontage and all lots containing nonresidential principal buildings or structures; provided, however, that no such front or
corner side yard shall be permitted to be less than twenty five feet (25') in the R-1 and R-2 districts and twenty feet (20') in the R-
3 and R-4 districts. When a lot has a front or corner side yard located on a frontage that contains three (3) or less lots, the front
or corner side yard applicable to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setbacks of all principal structures on
such frontage, including the existing building on the subject lot, which if vacant for less than five (5) years, the building that
previously sat on such lot shall be included, and excluding all lots containing nonresidential principal buildings or structures.
When determining a front or corner side yard required pursuant to this subsection, all measurements of setbacks of existing
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 452/605
buildings shall exclude all encroachments in front or corner side yards by covered, unenclosed porches authorized by subsection
I5 of this section. When a through lot is located on a frontage where fifty percent (50%) or more of the total number of lots on the
frontage are through lots, the front yard that is opposite the front yard toward which the front of the principal dwelling is oriented
shall be fifty percent (50%) of the average front yard as determined under this subsection; provided, however, that no such front
yard shall be permitted to be less than thirty five feet (35').
9. Side And Rear Yard Regulations For Accessory Structures And Uses: Parking areas wherever located and other detached
accessory structures and uses when located within the rear twenty percent (20%) of the lot shall not be required to maintain an
interior side or rear yard in excess of two feet (2'); provided, however, that when the rear yard of such lot abuts the side yard of
an adjacent lot, then detached accessory structures and uses shall not be located closer than six feet (6') from said side yard,
and provided further, however, that the exception provided by this subsection shall not apply to residential recreational facilities or
antennas and antenna support structures. No accessory structure or use, or combination of such structures or uses, other than
permitted accessory parking garages, located within an otherwise required side or rear yard pursuant to this subsection shall
occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of such required yard.
10. Corner And Interior Side Yard Adjustment: The required corner side yard in the R-3 and R-4 districts may be reduced by one
foot (1') for each foot of additional interior side yard provided in excess of the applicable minimum interior side yard requirement;
provided, however, that no such corner side yard shall be reduced to a size less than twenty feet (20').
11. Rear Yard Regulation For Decks: Decks shall not be required to maintain a rear yard in excess of twenty five feet (25') in the R-
1 and R-2 districts nor in excess of fifteen feet (15') in the R-3 and R-4 districts.
12. Special Floor Area Ratio Standard: This maximum floor area ratio requirement shall not apply to prevent development of a total
of two thousand eight hundred (2,800) square feet of gross building floor area.
13. Floor Area Bonus For Detached Garages: In determining the floor area ratio for lots having a detached garage and no other
garage, exclude one-half (1/2) of the area of the detached garage, but not more than two hundred fifty (250) square feet.
14. Building Coverage Exceptions: Coverage by the following structures and portions of structures shall not be included in
determining the amount of building coverage:
(a) Decks; and
(b) One-fourth (1/4) of the floor area of a detached garage located on a zoning lot having a detached garage and no other
garage, but not more than one hundred twenty five (125) square feet; and
(c) The first two hundred (200) square feet of a porch if all of the following criteria are met: 1) the porch is covered, and 2) the
porch is, and shall permanently remain, unenclosed, and 3) the porch is attached to that part of a single-family detached dwelling
that fronts a required front yard or corner side yard, and either 4) in the case of a front yard, the portion of the porch to which the
exemption applies lies between the widest apart side building lines of the dwelling or lies in front of the front building line of the
dwelling extended or 5) in the case of a corner side yard, the portion of the porch to which the exemption applies lies between
the frontmost and the rearmost building lines of the dwelling or lies in front of the corner side building line of the dwelling
extended; provided, however, that this exemption shall not exceed a total of two hundred (200) square feet for any zoning lot.
15. Residential Lot Coverage: For residential lots under ten thousand (10,000) square feet, maximum lot coverage shall be sixty
percent (60%).
16. Exception For Specified Structures: This limitation shall not apply to attached accessory structures, nor to air conditioning units,
antennas, or antenna support structures, nor to any accessory structure protected by a fire separation wall approved by the
village manager. (Ord. 92-43, §§ 2A, B, 3, 10-6-1992; Ord. 95-10, §§ 4A, 5, 6, 3-21-1995; Ord. 95-15, § 2B, 4-24-1995; Ord. 95-

MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
Sec. 4-101:Purposes:
Two (2) zoning districts are provided for multiple-family residential development. Only selected service uses that are compatible with
the residential character of these zoning districts are allowed in addition to permitted residential uses.
The R-5 district is designed principally in recognition of the existence of certain multiple-family uses on property developed under
county zoning regulations and subsequently annexed into the village. The R-5 district also is intended to function as a transition
between single-family detached and other zoning districts and to provide for lower density multiple-family building types, which may
result in higher densities than in single-family developments. The R-6 district allows for taller buildings and higher densities to
accommodate multiple-family structures developed under DuPage County zoning regulations and subsequently annexed into the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 453/605
village. The permitted use and bulk regulations are designed to encourage a moderate density residential area including alternate
housing types in a suburban environment. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-102:Mapping Restrictions:
A. R-5 District: The R-5 district shall be mapped only in areas where it is appropriate to accommodate existing multiple-family
development or where the flexibility offered by use of alternate low density housing types facilitates a logical transition between an
area of established single-family detached housing and adjacent property zoned in less restrictive zoning districts, or on existing
large tracts that are inappropriate for classification in a more restrictive district and that offer the opportunity for the creation of
significant amounts of usable open space through the use of alternate low density housing types, or as an expansion onto abutting
property of an existing R-5 district.
B. R-6 District: The R-6 district is designed to accommodate higher density multiple-family uses existing in the village on the effective
date of this code, most of which were developed under county zoning regulations and subsequently annexed into the village. The
R-6 district is inappropriate for mapping, and shall not be mapped, in any other area of the village. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-103:Permitted Uses:
The following uses and no others are permitted as of right in the multiple-family residential districts:
A. Single-family detached dwellings.
B. Townhouse (single-family attached) dwellings, but not more than eight (8) attached dwelling units in any one building.
C. Two-family dwellings.
D. Multiple-family dwellings, but only in the R-6 district. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-104:Accessory Structures And Uses:
Accessory structures and uses are permitted in all multiple-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-101 of this
code. (1991 Code)
Sec. 4-105:Home Occupations:
Home occupations are permitted in all multiple-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-102 of this code. (1991
Code)
Sec. 4-106:Temporary Uses:
Temporary uses are permitted in all multiple-family residential districts subject to the provisions of section 9-103 of this code. (1991
Code)
Sec. 4-107:Special Uses:
Except as specifically limited in the following subsections, the following uses may be permitted in all multiple-family residential districts
subject to the issuance of a special use permit as provided in section 11-602 of this code and subject to the additional standards
hereinafter set forth:
A. Multiple-family dwellings in the R-5 district.

G. Exceptions And Explanatory Notes:
1. Height Exceptions:
(a) Adjustment For Senior Citizen Housing: The plan commission may recommend and the board of trustees may authorize an
increase of the maximum permitted height to three (3) stories or thirty five feet (35'), whichever is less, in the R-5 district or six (6)
stories or sixty feet (60'), whichever is less, in the R-6 district when approving a special use permit for a senior citizen housing
development.
(b) Personal Wireless Services: Personal wireless services antennas, with or without antenna support structures, and related
electronic equipment and equipment structures, may extend to the following heights:
(i) Omnidirectional or whip antennas may extend to a height of fifteen feet (15') above the highest point of the roof of the building
or structure to which they are attached;
(ii) Directional or panel antennas may not extend above the highest point of the building or structure to which they are attached or
more than two feet (2') from the exterior of any wall or roof of the building or structure to which they are attached; and
(iii) Related electronic equipment and equipment structures shall not exceed applicable district height limitations.
2. Nonconforming Lots: See section 10-105 of this code for lot requirements with respect to legal nonconforming lots of record.
3. Density Adjustment For Senior Citizen Housing And Personal Care Facilities:
(a) Authority To Approve Increased Density: The plan commission may recommend and the board of trustees may authorize a
reduction of the minimum lot size per dwelling unit requirement, and thus an increase in the overall density of development, when
approving a special use permit for a senior citizen housing development in a multiple-family district.
(b) Maximum Permissible Adjustment: No such adjustment shall reduce the lot size per dwelling unit requirement to less than two
thousand (2,000) square feet unless in conjunction with a special use for a planned development that includes special use permit
applications for both a personal care facility and senior citizen housing, and provided that the structures that are the subject of
the application were constructed prior to the year 1980.
(c) Standard For Adjustment: No such adjustment shall be recommended or authorized except on the basis of a finding that the
adjustment will not result in any undue congestion in or adverse impact on the surrounding area. In determining the amount of
any such adjustment to be recommended or authorized, consideration shall be given to:
(i) The development's excellence in satisfying the standards set forth in subsection 4-107C of this article; and
(ii) The extent to which public or private subsidies are provided to allow some or all of the proposed dwelling units to be occupied
by individuals of low or moderate income within the meaning of section 103(b)(4)(A) of the internal revenue code of 1954, as
amended.
4. Calculation Of Nursing Or Personal Care Facility Density: Every patient bed in a nursing or personal care facility, whether in a
private, semiprivate, or dormitory room, shall be counted as one dwelling unit. In addition, any dwelling unit occupied or available
for occupancy by staff of the nursing or personal care facility shall be counted as a dwelling unit.
5. Clustering In Planned Developments: In planned developments, minimum lot size per unit requirements are intended only as a
limit on overall development density and not as a requirement that each individual unit be placed on a lot of the specified size. In
other words, units may be clustered together so long as sufficient common open space is provided within the development to
meet the average minimum lot size requirement of the development taken as a whole.
6. Lot Size Adjustments In Planned Developments: No adjustment of the minimum lot size per dwelling unit requirement pursuant
to subsection 11-603H of this code shall reduce the lot size per dwelling unit requirement to less than four thousand (4,000)
square feet in the R-5 district and two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in the R-6 district for a planned development in
a multiple-family district. No such adjustment shall be recommended or authorized except on the basis of the development's
excellence in achieving the purposes for which planned developments may be approved pursuant to subsection 11-603B of this
code and in satisfying the standards applicable to such developments as set forth in subsection 11-603E of this code. In
determining whether such excellence has been shown, special consideration shall be given to the following factors:
(a) The amount of usable open space; and
(b) The extent of land dedication for public building sites and open space; and
(c) The quality and extent of landscaping, including special elements such as water features and public art; and
(d) The quality and extent of recreational facilities such as golf courses; swimming pools, tennis courts, playgrounds, and other
residential recreational facilities; bicycle, hiking, and jogging trails; and community centers; and
(e) The quality of design of vehicular circulation elements and parking lots and areas; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 459/605
(f) The care taken to maximize energy conservation in site design, building design, and building systems; and
(g) The quality of roof design and finishes in terms of consistency with an attractive residential setting and the avoidance of flat
roofs.
7. Special Yard And Setback Requirements In Planned Developments: Special perimeter open space, setback, and spacing
requirements for planned developments are set forth in subsections 11-603E2(f) and E2(g) of this code. Such requirements shall
not be waived under any circumstances.
8. Visibility Across Corners: Any other provision of this code to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, allowed to grow, or maintained on any corner lot in any residential district in violation of the provisions of title 7, chapter
1, article D of the village code.
9. Special Setbacks For Signs: Special setbacks established for some signs by subsections 9-106F, H, I, and J of this code shall
control over the yards and setbacks established in the table.
10. Specified Structures And Uses In Required Yards: The following structures and uses, except as limited below, may be located
in any required yard:
(a) Statuary, arbors, trellises, and ornamental light standards having a height of ten feet (10') or less; and
(b) Eaves and gutters projecting not more than three feet (3') from an exterior wall; and
(c) Awnings, canopies, bay windows, and balconies projecting not more than three feet (3') into a front or rear yard from an
exterior wall for a distance not more than one-third (1/3) of the length of such wall or two feet (2') into a side yard from an exterior
wall for a distance not more than one-fourth (1/4) of the length of such wall; provided that such projections shall come entirely
within planes drawn from the main corners of the building at an interior angle of twenty two and one-half degrees (221/2°) with the
wall in question; and
(d) Chimneys, flues, belt courses, leaders, sills, pilasters, lintels, ornamental features, cornices, and the like projecting not more

11. Platted Building Lines: See subsection 12-101F of this code.
12. Front And Corner Side Yard Adjustment Next To Existing Structures: When a lot abuts, on both sides, lots that have already
been developed, the front yard applicable to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setbacks of the buildings
on the two (2) abutting lots; provided, however, that no such front yard shall be less than twenty five feet (25'). When a lot abuts a
lot that has already been developed on one side and a vacant lot or street on the other side, the front or corner side yard
applicable to such lot shall be determined by taking the average of the setback of the building on the abutting developed lot and
the required front yard in the zoning district; provided, however, that no such front or corner side yard shall be less than twenty
five feet (25').
13. Side And Rear Yard Regulations For Accessory Structures And Uses: Parking areas wherever located and other detached
accessory structures and uses when located within the rear twenty percent (20%) of the lot shall not be required to maintain an
interior side or rear yard in excess of two feet (2'); provided, however, that when the rear yard of such lot abuts the side yard of
an adjacent lot, then detached accessory structures and uses shall not be located closer than six feet (6') from said side yard,
and provided further, however, that the exception provided by this paragraph shall not apply to residential recreational facilities,
stables, or antennas and antenna support structures, and provided further, however, that no accessory structure or use, or
combination of such structures or uses, located within an otherwise required side or rear yard pursuant to this paragraph shall
occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of such required yard.
14. Application Of Side Yard Requirements To Townhouse Dwellings: In the case of townhouse dwellings, side yard requirements
shall apply to the entire structure and not to individual dwelling units therein.
15. Rear Yard Regulation For Decks: Decks shall not be required to maintain a rear yard in excess of fifteen feet (15').

Chapter 5
BUSINESS DISTRICTS
Sec. 5-101:Purposes:
Three (3) zoning districts are provided for business and commercial uses. When taken together, these districts are intended to permit
development of property for the full range of business and commercial uses needed to serve the citizens of Hinsdale and surrounding
areas in a suburban setting.
The districts, while distinct, permit a harmonious spectrum of general suburban shopping and service opportunities, ranging from a
relatively low intensity (B-1), through a higher intensity business zone intended to accommodate local shopping needs in a "downtown"
setting (B-2), to a more generalized commercial district designed for established areas of heavier vehicular traffic (B-3).
Specifically, the B-1 community business district is intended to serve the everyday shopping needs of village residents as well as to
provide opportunities for specialty shops attractive to wider suburban residential community around the village. It permits uses that are
necessary to satisfy most basic, frequently occurring shopping needs. Also allowed are compatible uses that, while not used as
frequently, would be desirably located in close proximity to potential users. This district is designed to accommodate development of
community shopping centers with planned off street parking and loading as well as existing individual shops or small groups of local
stores. The district is normally located on primary or secondary thoroughfares, is relatively small in size, and has bulk standards that
provide for compatibility with nearby residential uses.
The B-2 central business district is intended to serve the entire Hinsdale suburban community with a wide variety of retail and service
uses. It is intended to serve as the primary shopping area of the village. This district is located in the center of the village, adjacent to
commuter facilities, and at the convergence of primary thoroughfares. The bulk standards are intended to reflect the generally more
intense development of property in this area.
The B-3 general business district is intended to serve the Hinsdale suburban community with a full range of locally oriented business
uses commonly located along established traffic routes. (1991 Code)

with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such structure.
8. Licenses And Permits: The operator of every personal wireless services antenna shall submit to the village manager copies of all
licenses and permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the design, construction, location and

OFFICE DISTRICTS
Sec. 6-101:Purposes:
Three (3) zoning districts are provided for office development. The office districts accommodate a range of suburban office space
alternatives in keeping with the residential and local business atmosphere in the village.
In the office districts, the combination of use regulations and varied bulk and yard regulations is intended to:
A. Perpetuate the existing high quality character of the village by preserving established office use areas while permitting only
beneficial new office development consistent with the overall character and land use patterns of the existing village; and
B. Assure through height limits, setback and open space requirements, and mapping decisions that all office development is
compatible with the residential scale of village; and
C. Implement through reasonable regulation the purposes and intent of this code.
Specifically, the O-1 specialty office district is intended to provide for small offices in the older areas of the village adjacent to the
central business areas where it is possible to retain the residential character and appearance of the village and at the same time
promote limited business activity. The uses permitted are characterized by low traffic volume and limited outdoor advertising. The
regulations of the O-1 district are designed to encourage the retention and renovation of sound existing structures and to ensure that
the office uses remain compatible with the residential uses while permitting the area to maintain a distinctive residential character.
Replacement structures in the O-1 district also must have a residential character and appearance. The O-1 district normally is small in
size and located to provide a transition between residential areas and less restricted districts.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 473/605
The O-2 limited office district is designed to provide for the general needs of business and professional offices and related business
uses on smaller sites in scattered areas throughout the village. Bulk and height regulations encourage development that is
architecturally consistent with smaller sites and compatible with nearby residential uses.
The O-3 general office district is provided to accommodate the needs of business and professional offices and related business uses
requiring a somewhat wider range of office space with a somewhat higher intensity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic movements. Bulk
and height regulations are consistent with a moderate amount of development. (1991 Code)
Sec. 6-102:O-3 District Mapping Restriction:
The O-3 district shall be mapped only on property lying north of Ogden Avenue and east of York Road. (1991 Code)
Sec. 6-103:Permitted Uses:
The following uses and no others are permitted as of right in the office districts indicated in the following table. In interpreting the use
designations, reference should be made to the "Standard Industrial Classification Manual" (see appendix A) and section 11-501 of this

The regulations of the DR Design Review Overlay District are intended to promote the historic and architectural qualities of the Village
and thereby preserve the distinctive character of the Village. Various areas of the Village, such as the area around the old Graue Mill
and the downtown business district among others, have special historical, cultural, and design significance. These areas contain
historic or unique sites deserving protection. Many areas also serve a sensitive transitional function from one land use to another that
must be protected from incompatible development or redevelopment. The preservation and appropriate development of these areas
require rules and regulations specifically addressing these distinctive characteristics. The Design Review District has been created and
shall be mapped on the Zoning Map in furtherance of the following public purposes, which are hereby found to be in the interest of the
health, prosperity, and welfare of the Village and its residents:
A. Special character. To effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of improvements and areas of
special character or special historic and aesthetic interest or value which represent or reflect elements of the Village's cultural,
social, economic, political, and architectural history or distinction.
B. Local atmosphere. To maintain the local, "small town" atmosphere of various residential and business areas within the Village.
C. Compatibility. To insure compatibility of new development with the existing characteristics of the area.
D. Transitional areas. To protect sensitive areas of transition from one land use to another.
E. Attractiveness. To protect and enhance the Village's attractiveness to visitors and the support and stimulus to local business
provided thereby.

G. Education, pleasure, and welfare. To promote the use of areas within the Design Review District for the education, pleasure, and
welfare of the residents of the Village.
Sec. 8-102:Overlay district:
The Design Review District appears on the Zoning Map as an "Overlay District," imposed on top of other districts created by this Code
and referred to in this Section as "base districts." Development of properties in the Design Review District must comply both with the
regulations of the Design Review District and with the regulations of the base district in which they are located. When there is any
conflict between the Design Review District and the base district, the more restrictive provision shall control.
Sec. 8-103:Mapping restrictions:
The Design Review District shall be mapped on the Zoning Map only in those areas of the Village that constitute logically distinct areas
having the potential to provide cultural and civic benefits for the residents of the Village by reason of the prevalence of at least two of
the following factors:
A. Historical interest. The presence of special historical interest relating to local, state, or national history.
B. Special character. The presence of special character or aesthetic interest or value caused by the development pattern of the area or
by natural conditions or vegetative, landscaping, or topographical features of the area.
C. Historic architectural style. The presence of one or more periods or styles of architecture typical of one or more eras in the history of
the Village that gives the area a distinct character.
D. Local architectural value. The concentration of indigenous examples of local architecture that have not been significantly altered
from their original design.
E. Distinguished buildings or structures. The presence of one or more distinguished buildings or structures of high architectural quality
and historic interest.
F. Transitional areas. A location in a sensitive transitional area between varied land uses requiring careful control of development,
redevelopment, and remodeling, tailored to the special character of the area, to preserve and enhance the transitional function
served by existing structures and uses.
The Design Review District shall be mapped on the Zoning Map only pursuant to Subsection 11-601D of this Code.
Sec. 8-104:Development plan required:
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 11-601D1 of this Code, the Design Review District shall be mapped only after preparation
by the Board of Trustees of a written and graphic plan for the area proposed to be included in the district addressing the above-listed
factors and describing the purposes and intentions of the Board of Trustees in mapping the district. Such a written and graphic plan
shall be attached to, incorporated into, and approved as part of any ordinance granting approval of an application to map a Design
Review District.
The requirement of this Section shall not apply to the area previously classified as the "Historic Graue Mill Gateway District" by
Ordinance No. 10-7-80, which area is being mapped into the Design Review District as of the effective date of this Code.
Sec. 8-105:Design review permit required:
Unless a Design Review permit shall have first been obtained pursuant to Section 11-605 of this Code, no person shall perform, cause,
or permit any construction, alteration, remodeling, removal, movement, or demolition of any building, structure, or other improvement
or premises that is located within the Design Review District, and no person shall secure or issue a permit authorizing any such work.
No person shall maintain any property located within the Design Review District on which any such work has been performed in the
absence of, or in violation of the terms of, a Design Review permit. Repair of fire, storm, or other catastrophic damage with the same
material and configuration as existed prior to the fire does not require a Design Review permit.

and truck transportation;
2. Foster safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and pedestrians both on private property and on adjacent public streets; and
3. Minimize nuisance in residential areas from on or off street parking of large numbers of, or incompatible types of, vehicles.
B. Authorization: Subject to the limitations of this section and subsections 9-101D3 and D4 of this article, off street parking is permitted
as an accessory use in all districts. Off street parking as a principal use is permitted only when expressly authorized by the
regulations applicable to the district in question. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of any person to provide
off street parking in excess of the requirements herein established but all such parking shall comply with the standards of this
section.
C. Applicability To Existing, New, And Expanded Uses:
1. General Applicability: Except as provided otherwise in this section, the provisions of this section shall apply to, and off street
parking spaces sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this section shall be provided for, all existing and new uses, in accordance
with the provisions of articles X and XII of this code.
2. Changes In Existing Use: Whenever a use existing on the effective date of this section is changed to a new use, parking spaces
shall be provided as required by this code for the new use. Notwithstanding this requirement, however, when the existing use
was deficient in required parking spaces on the effective date of this section, then the new use may be established with a parking
space deficiency as follows:
(a) If the new use requires the same number, or more, parking spaces than the existing use, and more spaces than exist for the
existing use, then the new use may be established with a deficiency equal in number to the preexisting deficiency; or
(b) If the new use requires fewer parking spaces than the existing use, but more spaces than exist for the existing use, then the
new use may be established with a deficiency equal in number to the number of spaces required for that new use minus the
number of existing spaces; or
(c) If the new use requires the same number of, or fewer, parking spaces than exist for the existing use, then no deficiency shall
be permitted for the new use.
3. Increase In Use Intensity: Whenever the intensity of use of any structure or use is increased through the addition of dwelling
units, floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking spaces, parking spaces as
required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use; provided, however, that this shall not apply to the addition
of dwelling units in any structure in the B-2 central business district.
D. Exceptions:
1. Minor Additions: Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, no building or use lawfully existing on the effective date
of this code, or any amendment to it establishing parking requirements with respect to such structure or use, shall be required to
provide any additional parking spaces pursuant to this section unless and until the aggregate increase in the units of
measurement by which the parking requirement is calculated shall equal ten percent (10%) or more of the units of measurement
required upon such effective date, in which event parking spaces as required herein shall be provided for the total aggregate
increase.
2. Nonconforming Locations And Designs: Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the continued utilization of any
parking space as an accessory use to any structure or use for parking of a vehicle that may lawfully be parked in such space
solely because such space does not satisfy the location or design requirements of this code, or any amendment to it, if such
space was validly in use as an accessory use to such structure or use on the effective date of this code or such amendment.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 510/605
3. Remote Parking Spaces: When proposed to eliminate a parking deficiency or when required because of a change in use or an
increase in use intensity pursuant to subsection C2 or C3 of this section, parking spaces may be located within any district
adjacent to the district in which the principal use in question is a permitted use, or within the same zoning district as, and within
one thousand feet (1,000') of, the zoning lot on which the use to be served is located; provided, however, that such remote
parking spaces may be allowed only when such remote site is covenanted to remain as parking for so long as said parking
spaces are required to meet the standards of this code.
4. Access Across Separate Zoning Lot: No such access to an adjacent street shall be provided through a zoning lot other than the
zoning lot on which the parking lot is located except across a permanent, recorded access easement in form and substance
satisfactory to the village attorney.

pursuant to this section for an existing, new, or change of use in the B-2 central business district, that owner or applicant may pay
to the village a per space fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in lieu of providing up to seven (7) of those
required additional spaces. In addition, that owner or applicant may pay the same per space fee in lieu of providing a greater
number of those required additional spaces if, but only if, that owner or applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the board of
trustees that all of the following standards are satisfied:
(a) Effect On Purpose: The elimination of more than seven (7) of those additional required spaces will not have an unduly
adverse effect on the purposes for which this code was enacted, or on the purposes for which the regulations of B-2 central
business district were established, or on general purpose and intent of the official comprehensive plan; and
(b) Effect On Adjacent Property: The elimination of more than seven (7) of those additional required spaces will not have an
unduly adverse effect on adjacent property or the public health, safety, and general welfare; and
(c) Effect On Traffic Congestion: The elimination of more than seven (7) of those additional required spaces will not cause undue
traffic congestion; and
(d) Compliance: The proposed use or development for which those additional spaces are required complies with all standards
imposed on it by the particular provision of this code authorizing that use or development.

central business district, including the possible development and maintenance of additional parking facilities in the B-2 district
or on property abutting the B-2 district.
(e) Parking Space Reductions In The B-2 District: If any owner or applicant to which the requirements of this subsection apply is
authorized to reduce the number of off street parking spaces existing on the effective date of this code accessory to a use in
the B-2 central business district pursuant to planned development approval, grant of a variation, or some other approval made
by the village, then that owner or applicant shall pay to the village the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per space for
each space reduced, which payment shall be in addition to any payment made pursuant to subsection D5 of this section. Such
sums so paid to the village shall be used by the village for improvements benefiting the B-2 central business district, including
the possible development and maintenance of additional parking facilities in said district or on property abutting said district.
E. Landbanking/Reserve Areas For Required Parking:
1. Landbanking Authorized: Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the board of trustees may, by special use permit
granted pursuant to section 11-602 of this code, reduce the total number of off street parking spaces required to be paved
pursuant to subsection J of this section or the stall length and width dimension required pursuant to subsection I4 of this section,
subject to acceptance by the property owner of the conditions set forth in subsections E2 through E4 of this section.
2. Termination Of Landbanking: The board of trustees shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to require the property
owner or his or her successor at any time to increase the stall length and width to the dimension required by subsection I4 of this
section or to increase the number of parking spaces provided to serve said development up to the maximum required by
subsection J of this section for the property in question as if no special use permit for landbanking had been granted.
3. Alternate Plans Required: Every application for a special use permit to allow landbanking of required parking spaces shall be
accompanied by alternate detailed parking plans. One plan shall show the full stall length and width required by subsection I4 of
this section and the full number of parking spaces required pursuant to subsection J of this section; the other plan shall show the
reduced stall length and width or the reduced number of parking spaces or both, as the case may be, proposed to be provided
pursuant to the special use permit being sought and also shall show the landscaping treatment of areas proposed to be reserved
for future parking requirements. Both such plans shall show the location on the site of all parking areas, the exact number of
parking spaces to be provided, and complete details for: a) wheel stops, b) markings, c) curbing, d) surfacing, e) screening and
landscaping, f) lighting, g) signing, and h) access. The design plans for such parking areas shall be subject to the approval of the
board of trustees.

Sec. 9-106:Signs:
A. Purpose: The regulation of signs by this code is intended to promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing
the depreciation of property values caused by signs that are incompatible with surrounding land uses; by creating a more attractive
economic and business climate within the office and commercial areas of the village; by enhancing and protecting the physical
appearance of all areas of the village; by protecting signs from obstruction by other signs; and by reducing the distractions,
obstructions, and hazards to pedestrian and auto traffic caused by the indiscriminate placement and use of signs.
B. Scope: The regulations of this section shall govern and control the erection, enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation,
maintenance, relocation, and removal of all signs within the village visible from any street, sidewalk, or public or private common
open space. Any sign not expressly permitted by these regulations shall be prohibited. The regulations of this section relate to the
location of signs, by function and type, within zoning districts and shall be in addition to provisions of the Hinsdale building and

Chapter 10
NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 10-101:General provisions:
A. Purposes. This Article X regulates and limits the continued existence of uses, structures, lots, and signs established prior to the
effective date of this Code that do not conform to the regulations of this Code applicable in the zoning districts in which such uses,
structures, lots, and signs are located.
The zoning districts established by this Code are designed to guide the future use of land within the Village by encouraging the
development or maintenance of desirable residential, business, and office areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and
related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of
nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual
elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
B. General scope and scheme of regulation. Separate restrictions are established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming
uses of structures designed for a permitted use, nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a permitted use, nonconforming
structures (herein sometimes referred to as "pre-code structures"), nonconforming lots of record, and nonconforming signs. The
degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with
permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to Section 11-503 of
this Code, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this Article X when practical difficulties exist.
C. Exception for repairs pursuant to public order. Nothing in this Article X shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration
to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and
who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such restoration is not otherwise in
violation of the various provisions of this Article X prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures
or signs.
D. Nonconforming accessory uses and structures. No use, structure, or sign that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or
structure shall continue after such principle use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
Sec. 10-102:Nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted
use:
A. Authority to continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use not involving the
use of a structure, or involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land, or located in a structure designed
for a use permitted in the district in which it is located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
regulations contained in Subsections B through H of this Section and in Subsections D and E of Section 10-101 of this Code.
For purposes of this Section, any structure that is used in connection with a nonconforming use of land and that has an assessed
value of less than $5,000.00 on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto creating such nonconformity shall be
considered to be a structure accessory to a nonconforming use of land.
B. Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and the installation or relocation of
non-bearing or curtain walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is
accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use but devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections C through I of this
Section.
C. Structural alteration. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and
devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or
space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure.
In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1
and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.

D. Enlargement of structure. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and
devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, including the interior addition of
floor area, unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. No
such enlargement shall create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity
has been created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.
E. Extension of use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use in a structure designed for a permitted use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity.
Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited to:
1. An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any structure or land area other than that occupied by such
nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming;
and
2. An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that
was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto that causes such use
to become nonconforming; and
3. An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or
any amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming.
F. Moving. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole
or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district
in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
G. Change in use. A nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in the district in which it is located
shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use or structure is located. When such
a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonpermitted use. For
purposes of this Subsection G, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use shall have
been terminated and a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period of five days. Any change of use in violation
of this Subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing nonconforming use.
H. Damage or destruction. Any structure:
1. That is accessory to a nonconforming use of land and that is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 25
percent of the cost of replacement of such structure new; or
2. That is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed
by any means, where such damage or destruction involves damage or destruction of the portion of such structure devoted to the
nonconforming use, to the extent of more than 25 percent of the cost of replacement of such portion new,
shall not be restored unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located and unless such restoration is accomplished without creating any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity or increasing the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage
or destruction. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of
Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.
When any such structure, or the portion thereof devoted to a nonconforming use, is damaged or destroyed by any means not
within the control of the owner thereof to the extent of 25 percent or less of the cost of replacement new of the structure, or the
portion thereof devoted to a nonconforming use, repair or restoration of such structure may be made; provided, however, that no
repairs or restorations shall be made that would create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase
the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction, nor shall any
repairs or restoration except in conformity with the applicable zoning district regulations be made unless a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage or destruction and
is diligently pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within the control of the owner be repaired or re-stored
except in accordance with Subsections B, C, and D of this Section.
I. Termination of certain uses.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 537/605
1. Termination in accordance with previous amortization schedule. Any nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or
involving only a structure that is accessory to the nonconforming use of land that was required to be removed by former Section
10-1-6 of the Hinsdale Zoning Ordinance, as amended, that has not been removed in accordance with the terms of that section
shall be removed immediately and every such use is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance.
2. Termination by abandonment. When a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only a structure that is
accessory to the nonconforming use of land or when a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure that was designed for a
use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located is discontinued or abandoned for a period of three
consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply with the use regulations of
the zoning district in which such land or structure is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and without any
contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of
this Paragraph.
Sec. 10-103:Nonconforming uses in structures not designed for a permitted use:
A. Authority to continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use located in a
structure not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which it is located may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Subsections B through H of this Section and in Subsections D and E of
Section 10-101 of this Code.
B. Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and the installation or relocation of
non-bearing or curtain walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any structure devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such structure is
located; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Subsections C through I of this
Section.
C. Structural alteration. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located shall be structurally altered unless the entire structure and the use thereof
shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new parking,
loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or increased, the
provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.
D. Enlargement of structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, including the interior addition
of floor area, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is
located. No such alteration shall create a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any
existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a parking or loading
nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of Paragraphs 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this Code shall control.
E. Extension of use.
1. Prohibited extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity by:
(a) An extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective
date of this Code or any amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming; or
(b) An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or
any amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming.
2. Permitted extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located may be extended throughout any part of such structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this
Code or any amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such extension shall not
be allowed unless off-street parking and loading spaces required for such extension can be, and are, provided in accordance
with the requirements and restrictions of Sections 9-104 and 9-105 of this Code. No such extension shall be deemed to affect the
duty to terminate such use pursuant to Subsection I of this Section.
F. Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on
the same or any other lot unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located after being so moved.

G. Change In Use: A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located shall not be changed to any use other than a nonconforming use of a more restricted classification or a use
permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted
nonconforming use or to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a less restricted nonconforming use. For
purposes of this subsection, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use shall have been
terminated and a more restricted nonconforming use or a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period of five
(5) days. Any change of use in violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing
nonconforming use.
H. Damage Or Destruction: Any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located that is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the cost of replacement of such structure new shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof
shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless such restoration is accomplished
without creating a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increasing the degree of any existing parking,
loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure existing prior to such damage or destruction. In determining whether a
parking or loading nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of subsections 9-104B1 and 9-105B1 of this code
shall control.
When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control of the owner thereof to the extent of fifty
percent (50%) or less of the cost of replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such structure may be made;
provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall be made that would create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity or increase the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure existing prior to
such damage or destruction nor shall any repairs or restoration except in conformity with the applicable zoning district regulations
be made unless a certificate of zoning compliance is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of
such partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within the control of the owner be repaired or restored
except in accordance with subsections B, C, and D of this section.

provisions of subsections 9-101D6 and D7 of this code that has not been removed in accordance with the terms of that section
shall be removed immediately and every such structure is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. Any structure
subject to said section 10-1-6 that was not fully amortized pursuant thereto shall be terminated and removed at the earliest date
required either by that section or by this subsection I.
2. Termination By Abandonment: When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure that was not designed or intended for
any use permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located is discontinued or abandoned for a period of six (6)
consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed.
Any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the use regulations of the district in which such structure is
located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and without any
contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of
this paragraph. (1991 Code)
Sec. 10-104:Precode Structures:
A. Authority To Continue: Any precode structure may be maintained, altered, enlarged, rebuilt, restored, and repaired so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in subsections B through E of this section and subsection 10-101D of this
article.
B. Maintenance, Repair, Alteration, And Enlargement: Any precode structure may be maintained, repaired, altered or enlarged;
provided, however, that except as hereinafter expressly provided, no such maintenance, repair, alteration, or enlargement shall
either create any new parking, loading, yard, bulk or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any parking, loading, yard,
bulk, or space nonconformity of all or any part of such structure as it existed on the effective date of this code. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence:
1. Front And Rear Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that is nonconforming with respect to a required
front or rear yard may be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls but may not be extended horizontally; and

2. Side Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that is nonconforming with respect to a required side yard may
be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls; provided, however, that no such extension shall be allowed within ten
feet (10') of any side lot line in the R-1 and R-2 districts or within six feet (6') of any side lot line in the R-3 and R-4 districts; and
3. Side Yard Horizontal Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that is nonconforming with respect to a required side yard
may be extended horizontally between the required front and rear yard lines at a distance from the side lot line equal to the
greater of: a) the minimum existing distance between said side lot line and said nonconforming portion or b) ten feet (10') in the
R-1 and R-2 districts or six feet (6') in the R-3 and R-4 districts; and
4. Roof Elevation Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that is nonconforming with respect to the permitted maximum
elevation may be extended horizontally at an elevation in excess of said permitted maximum elevation; provided, however, that
the top of the roof of such extension shall not exceed the top of the precode structure.
5. Roof Height Extensions: Any portion of precode structure located on a conforming lot in a single-family residential district that is
nonconforming with respect to the permitted maximum height and that is a precode structure solely due to the nonconforming
height of the structure may be extended: a) horizontally at a height in excess of said permitted maximum height but not in excess
of the roofline of the existing structure or b) horizontally and vertically at a height in excess of the permitted maximum height but
not in excess of the height of the structure as of the date of initial occupancy of the original structure, provided, however, that
such extension shall not be permitted where the height of the structure as of the date of initial occupancy of the original structure
exceeded the maximum height authorized by law; and, in either case, such extension shall not extend more than twenty four
inches (24") beyond the exterior face of the exterior walls of said existing structure.

building coverage regulations and notwithstanding the limitations set in subsection C1 of this section, a detached garage
accessory to, and on the same zoning lot as, a precode single-family detached dwelling structure may be demolished and
replaced with a new detached garage if, but only if, all of the following conditions and standards are met: a) the dwelling was
constructed prior to 1950, b) the dwelling does not have an attached garage, and c) the replacement garage does not exceed a
total floor area of four hundred forty (440) square feet.

this section shall be construed to increase the degree of an existing nonconformity. For purposes of this subsection B, the
provisions of subsection D of this section shall, where applicable, be applied in determining the existence and extent of any side
yard nonconformity.
C. Damage Or Destruction: Any precode structure that is demolished, damaged, or destroyed by any means, whether or not within the
control of the owner thereof, may be rebuilt, restored, or repaired; provided, however, that:
1. Voluntary Damage: In no event shall any demolition, damage, or destruction to such a structure caused by any means within the
control of the owner be rebuilt, restored, or repaired except in conformity with all of the applicable district regulations other than
minimum lot area and lot dimension regulations.
2. Involuntary Damage: In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure caused by any means not within the control
of the owner be rebuilt, restored, or repaired so as to create any new parking, loading, yard, bulk, or space nonconformity or to
increase the degree of any parking, loading, yard, bulk, or space nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction. For
the purposes of this subsection C2, any vertical or horizontal extension of a structure in violation of the yard, bulk, or space
regulations applicable in the district in which such structure is located shall be construed to increase the degree of an existing
nonconformity, except that:
(a) Front And Rear Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that was, prior to such damage or destruction,
nonconforming with respect to a required front or rear yard may be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls but may
not be extended horizontally; and
(b) Side Yard Vertical Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that was, prior to such damage or destruction,
nonconforming with respect to a required side yard may be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls; provided,
however, that no such extension shall be allowed within ten feet (10') of any side lot line in the R-1 and R-2 districts or within six
feet (6') of any side lot line in the R-3 and R-4 districts; and
(c) Side Yard Horizontal Extensions: Any portion of a precode structure that was, prior to such damage or destruction,
nonconforming with respect to a required side yard may be extended horizontally between the required front and rear yard lines
at a distance from the side lot line equal to at least: 1) the minimum existing distance between said side lot line and said
nonconforming portion as it existed prior to such damage or destruction and 2) ten feet (10') in the R-1 and R-2 districts or six
feet (6') in the R-3 and R-4 districts.
For purposes of this subsection C, the provisions of subsection D of this section shall, where applicable, be applied in
determining the minimum yards required and the existence and extent of any side yard nonconformity.
D. Special Yard Regulations: Whenever any precode structure is located on a lot that does not comply with the lot area or lot width
regulations of the district in which it is located, such structure may be maintained, altered, enlarged, rebuilt, restored, and repaired
subject to the side yard regulations for such district as stated in subsection 10-105A of this article rather than the side yard
regulations otherwise applicable in such district.

programs to be undertaken by the village with respect to its future maintenance and development.
D. Effect: After the adoption of the official comprehensive plan or a part thereof, no ordinance, regulation, or official map relating to the
physical maintenance, development, or redevelopment of the village or any land within it shall be enacted, established, amended,
or varied and no right of way, street, utility, or public structure or land shall be authorized, established, developed, redeveloped, or
modified in location or extent except in accordance with the policies, goals, objectives, principles, and standards of the official
Comprehensive Plan or relevant part thereof unless the Board of Trustees shall first make a specific finding that the facts and
circumstances affecting the particular matter justify a departure from the Official Comprehensive Plan.
E. Procedures.
1. Plan development. The Plan Commission, with the assistance of the Village Manager and the Village Manager's staff, shall
exercise the powers and duties delegated to it by Section 11-103 of this Article XI in the continuing development and revision of
the Official Comprehensive Plan. The process of plan development is necessarily an informal one not readily adaptable to rigid
procedures, but the Plan Commission and the Village Manager, in developing a plan, shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain
the views, comments, and criticisms of interested persons. In addition, the Plan Commission, prior to making any
recommendation for the adoption or amendment of a plan or part thereof to the Board of Trustees, shall set, notice, and conduct
a public hearing thereon in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-303 of this Article XI.
The Board of Trustees may, at any time, refer a plan to the Plan Commission for consideration and recommendation. In the case
of such referral, the Plan Commission shall return its recommendation to the Board of Trustees not later than 90 days following
the receipt of the referral. In the event such recommendation is not so delivered, the Board of Trustees may proceed to consider
the amendment without such recommendation.
When satisfied that a plan or a part thereof is adequate for adoption as or amendment of the Official Comprehensive Plan of the
Village or a part thereof, the Plan Commission shall transmit such plan or part thereof to the Board of Trustees together with its
recommendations for adoption of such plan as well as any reports or statements deemed necessary to a full consideration of
such plan or part thereof. Such reports or statements may include majority and minority positions. Such transmittal shall be made
not later than 15 days following the close of the public hearing concerning such plan.
2. Plan adoption. Upon receiving any recommendation of the Plan Commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any
plan or a part thereof, the Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly enacted, may adopt such plan in whole or in part, with or without
amendments; or may refer such plan or any part thereof back to the Plan Commission for further consideration; or may reject
such plan. The Board of Trustees shall take such action not later than 90 days following the close of the Plan Commission public
hearing on such plan. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such period shall be deemed to be a rejection of the plan.
Upon the adoption of any such plan or part thereof, it shall be designated as the "Official Comprehensive Plan of the Village of
Hinsdale" and, if less than a total comprehensive plan, shall carry a subheading designating its specific contents.
3. Plan amendment. The Official Comprehensive Plan, or any part thereof, may be amended at any time in accordance with the
provisions of this Paragraph 3. Such an amendment may be initiated by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, the Village
Manager, or by any owner of property affected by the provisions of such plan sought to be amended. Amendments initiated by
the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, or the Village Manager shall require no formal application and shall be processed
as provided in Paragraphs E1 and E2 of this Section. Amendments initiated by the owner of affected property shall be initiated by
an application filed pursuant to Section 11-301 of this Code, except that the time limits specified in Paragraphs E1 and E2 of this
Section shall apply.
4. Plan filing and notice of adoption. The ordinance adopting the Official Comprehensive Plan, or any part thereof, shall provide that
the Village Manager shall cause a certified copy thereof to be placed on file in the Office of the Village Clerk and shall cause a
notice evidencing the adoption of such plan, or part thereof, to be filed with the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds and the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds.
Sec. 11-202:Official map:
A. Authority. The Plan Commission shall have authority to prepare and to recommend to the Board of Trustees an Official Map of the
Village and the unincorporated areas surrounding the Village and from time to time to prepare and recommend amendments
thereto, all of which the Board of Trustees may adopt as the "Official Map of the Village of Hinsdale."
B. Definition. The "Official Map" shall be defined as a compilation of maps, standards, and specifications of and for existing and
proposed rights-of-way, streets, alleys, utility easements, public grounds, and public utility systems within the Village or within the
unincorporated area lying within one and one-half miles of its boundaries as they may from time to time exist, prepared and
recommended by the Plan Commission with the advice and assistance of the Village Manager and the Village Manager's staff, and
adopted by the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time
to time. The term "Official Map" also shall refer to any internally consistent and complete portion of such a compilation relating to
any one or more of the aforesaid subjects or to any specific portion of the aforesaid geographical area. As of the effective date of
this Code, the term "Official Map" shall be understood to refer to the documents listed in Subsection 11-201B of this Code.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 550/605
The Official Map referred to in this Section is the map authorized by Sections 11-2-6 et seq. of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev.
Stat. ch. 24, 11-12-6 et seq.
C. Purpose. The Official Map is adopted to implement the Official Comprehensive Plan, to assure the adequacy of the public facilities
to which it relates, and to secure for the Village the authority and benefits provided by state law in connection with such an Official
Map.
D. Effect. The Official Map shall have the effect accorded to it by Sections 11-12-8 et seq. of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat.
ch. 24, 11-12-8 et seq., and also shall have the effect accorded to the Official Comprehensive Plan by Subsection 11-201D of this
Article XI.
E. Procedures. The procedures for the development, adoption, amendment, and filing of the Official Map shall be the same as those
provided in Subsection 11-201E of this Code with respect to the Official Comprehensive Plan.

A. Place of filing. All applications filed pursuant to this Code shall be filed with the Office of the Village Manager or with such other
Village official or body as the Village Manager may by administrative order designate.
B. Form; number; scale. All applications filed pursuant to this Code shall be on forms supplied by the Village and shall be filed in such
number of duplicate copies as the Village Manager may designate by administrative order. All plans filed as part of any application
shall be at a scale sufficient to permit a clear and precise understanding of the contents of said plans and the proposal being made
and shall be folded to a size of eight and one-half inches by 14 inches.
C. Filing deadlines.
1. Applications requiring hearings. An application requiring a public hearing will not be scheduled for such hearing unless filed, in
proper form and number and containing all required information, not later than 5:00 p.m. on the fourth Friday preceding the
requested hearing date. An application so filed will be scheduled for hearing on the requested hearing date, or on the first
available date thereafter open on the relevant hearing agenda, on a first-filed-first-scheduled basis.
2. Applications not requiring hearing. An application that does not require a public hearing shall be filed, in proper form and number
and containing all required information, at least 28 days prior to the time when action on the application is requested. An
application so filed will be processed on a first-filed-first-processed basis.
3. Supplemental data. Whenever supplemental data in connection with a previously filed application is required by the Village or
offered by the applicant, it shall be submitted at least seven days prior to the date on which it is to be considered at a hearing or
a meeting or acted upon in connection with such application. The filing of such data shall, in the discretion of the Village Manager
and of the body hearing the application, be cause to delay a requested or scheduled hearing date.
D. Fees.
1. Fee established; lien. Every application filed pursuant to this Code shall be accompanied by a non-refundable application and
filing fee equal to $25.00 plus the cost incurred by the Village in processing such application, as shall be fixed from time to time
by administrative order of the Village Manager. The owner of the property subject of the application and, if different, the applicant
shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of said fee. By signing the application, the owner shall be deemed to have
agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to ensure collection of any
such fee, plus the costs of collection, in the event such fee has not been properly paid as required with the filing of the
application. Any lien filed pursuant to this Subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or
mechanics' liens.
2. Recoverable costs. The costs incurred by the Village in processing an application shall be deemed to consist at least of the
following items of direct and indirect expense:
(a) Legal Publication (direct cost);
(b) Recording Secretarial Services (direct cost);
(c) Court Reporter (direct cost);
(d) Document Preparation and Review (hourly salary times a multiplier to be established from time to time by administrative order
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 551/605
of the Village Manager at a level sufficient to recover 100 percent of the direct and indirect cost of such service);
(e) Copy Reproduction (direct cost);
(f) Document Recordation (direct cost);
(g) Inspection Fees (direct cost);
(h) Professional and technical consultant services (direct cost); and
(i) Legal review, consultation, and advice (direct) cost).
3. Condition of all applications, approvals, and permits; time periods. No application filed pursuant to this code shall be considered
complete unless and until all fees due pursuant to this Subsection have been paid. Every approval granted and every permit
issued pursuant to this Code, whether or not expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of fees
as required by this Subsection.
When this Code provides that the passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation
for approval, all time periods shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue to run.
The failure to fully pay any such fee when due shall be grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or revoking
any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid fee relates.
4. Waiver for specified public bodies. The provisions of this Subsection 11-301D may be waived by the Board of Trustees for fees
applicable to any application filed by any public body, or any agency deriving the majority of its revenues from taxes levied within
the Village or any charitable or eleemosynary organization.
5. Notification. The Village shall notify an applicant when the costs incurred in processing that applicant's application surpass
$5,000, and shall thereafter notify such applicant when such costs surpass each $500 increment grater than $5,000. The failure
of the Village to notify any such applicant shall not relieve such applicant of the duty to pay all such costs and shall not prevent
the Village from assessing and collecting all such costs.
6. Hardship. The Village Manager, in his or her sole discretion, may reduce or waive any fee required pursuant to this Subsection
11-301D, but only after a showing, in writing, by the Applicant of a particular hardship caused by the application of such fee.
E. Minimum data requirements. Every application submitted pursuant to this Code shall contain such information as is required by the
Village from time to time. Application requirements shall be established by administrative order and shall be made available to all
applicants in the office of the Village Manager.
F. Special data requests. In addition to the data and information required pursuant to Subsection E of this Section, every applicant shall
submit such other and additional data, information, or documentation as the Village Manager or any board or commission before
which its application is pending may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of the
particular application.
G. Waiver of application requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Village Manager shall have the
authority to waive any requirement set forth in Subsections A, B, C, or E of this Section when, in his or her judgment, such waiver is
appropriate in light of the nature and extent of the relief being sought or in light of special circumstances making compliance with
those provisions either unnecessary or unduly burdensome; provided, however, that any board or commission before which such
application may come shall continue to have the right to request additional information pursuant to Subsection F of this Section and
to delay processing of such application until such information is provided and available in accordance with the deadlines
established in Subsection C of this Section. The Village Manager shall provide, in writing, his or her reasons why any such
requirement has been waived, and shall refer such writing to the appropriate boards and commissions.
H. Concurrent applications. When a proposed use or development requires more than one approval pursuant to this Code,
applications for all such approvals may be filed concurrently notwithstanding the fact that approval of one application may be a
precondition to approval of other applications. Such applications may, in the discretion of the official, officials, body, or bodies
charged with review of such applications be processed together; provided, however, that no application shall be approved unless all
applications that are a precondition to its approval have first been approved.
I. Withdrawal of application. An applicant may withdraw an application at any time prior to a final decision having been rendered with
respect thereto, provided that the applicant shall have paid all applicable fees pursuant to Subsection 11-301D of this Code. Such
withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the applicant's right to refile such application, but any such refiling shall be treated as an
entirely new filing and shall be subject to the procedures and fees of this Code in the same manner as any other new application.
(Ord. No. 92-20, §§ 2, 3, 7-7-92)
Sec. 11-302:Successive applications:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 552/605
A. Second applications without new grounds barred. Whenever any application filed pursuant to this Code has been finally denied on
its merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the same form or on the same theory, shall not
be brought unless in the opinion of the officer, board, or commission before which it is brought there is substantial new evidence
available or a mistake of law or fact significantly affected the prior denial.
B. New grounds to be stated. Any such second application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of
such application.
C. Summary denial with or without hearing. Any such second application may be denied by the Village Manager summarily, and
without hearing, on a finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such application is set for
hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to being
allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for
such failure.
D. Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second application filed more than two years after the final denial of a
prior application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had been filed. The applicant shall, however, be
required to place in the record all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have developed since the
denial of the first application. In the absence of such evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
Sec. 11-303:Public hearings and meetings:
A. Setting hearing or meeting; time limitation. When the provisions of this Code require a public hearing or public meeting in
connection with any application filed pursuant to this Code, the body charged with conducting the hearing or meeting shall, upon
receipt of a properly completed application, fix a reasonable time and place for such hearing or meeting; provided, however, that
such hearing or meeting shall be commenced no later than 60 days, and shall be concluded no later than 120 days, following the
submission of the subject application unless the applicant shall agree to an extension or unless the hearing or meeting agenda of
the body is completely committed during that time.
B. Notice.
1. Manager to give notice. The Village Manager shall cause notice to be given of public hearings and public meetings set pursuant
to Subsection A of this Section in the form and manner and to the persons herein specified.

(ii) If a specific parcel is the subject of the application, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery to all
owners of property within 250 feet of the subject property. Notice as required by this Subparagraph shall be given by the

public notice, shall refer every application for which this Code requires a hearing before either the Plan Commission, the Zoning
Board of Appeals, or the Historic Preservation Commission to all appropriate Village commissions and departments.
2. Review and comments. Each Village commission and department to which an application is referred pursuant to this Subsection
shall review such application and submit its comments thereon to the Staff Secretary of the hearing body for presentation to that
body at the hearing to be held on such application. Such comments shall, whenever possible, be submitted at least two business
days prior to the date set for the hearing and shall be made available to any person on request prior to the hearing.
D. Conduct of hearings

unduly repetitious evidence.
2. Rights Of Parties And Proximate Owners: Subject to the discretion of the hearing body, the applicant, any board, commission,
department, or official of the village, and any property owner entitled to written notice pursuant to subsection B3(b)(ii) of this

(a) To present witnesses on their behalf.
(b) To cross examine all witnesses testifying in opposition to their position.

undue and unwarranted delay would result, or when to do so would tend to produce no new evidence to aid the hearing body
in reaching its decision.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 554/605

cost of such copies. (1991 Code)
Article 4. Zoning Certificates
Sec. 11-401:Certificate Of Zoning Compliance:
A. Authority: The village manager shall have authority to issue certificates of zoning compliance, but only in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
B. Purpose: The certificate of zoning compliance is intended to serve two (2) general purposes. First, it provides a procedure for
reviewing plans for conformance with this code and a means for evidencing such conformance. Second, it serves as an adjunct to,
and thus must be filed prior to or with, all other applications filed pursuant to this code with respect to a specific use or development
proposal. When so filed, it serves as a vehicle for routine plan review by the village manager prior to consideration of special
requests by other officials, boards, and commissions, thus avoiding needless special reviews of defective plans.
C. Certificate Required: Unless a certificate of zoning compliance shall be first obtained from the village manager, except for permits
for improvements expressly waived in this section or expressly waived by another provision of this code:
1. The construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of any structure, except signs, shall not be commenced; and
2. No land vacant on the effective date of this code shall be used or occupied for any purpose, except the raising of crops; and
3. The grading, excavation, or improvement of land preliminary to any construction on or use of such land, other than those
associated with landscape improvements, shall not be commenced; and
4. Building or other permits pertaining to the construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of any structure or the
use of any land or structure, excluding permits for:
(a) Suppression/detection;
(b) Replacement of existing mechanical equipment;
(c) Fences;
(d) Interior remodeling (when no new living space is created);
(e) Roofing;
(f) Irrigation;
(g) Elevators;
(h) Electrical (when no other work and/or permit would be required);
(i) Plumbing (when no other work and/or permit would be required), shall not be issued by the village; and
5. No home occupation shall be established or maintained; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 555/605
6. No temporary use shall be established or maintained, except as provided in subsection 9-103C1 of this code; and
7. No land shall be annexed to the village.
In any case where a certificate of zoning compliance is not required under this code, the manager shall, on written request, issue
a certificate of such fact.
D. Relation To Other Applications: No application filed pursuant to part III of this article with respect to a specific use or development
proposal shall be processed unless an application for a certificate of zoning compliance shall first have been received, processed,
and approved, or denied solely on one or more grounds that form the basis for the application filed pursuant to part III of this article.
It is the intent of this section that no application filed pursuant to part III of this article with respect to a specific use or development
proposal shall be processed until the village manager is satisfied that the proposed use or development complies with the
provisions of this code in all respects except those within the scope of such application.
E. Procedure:
1. Application: Applications for certificate of zoning compliance shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301
of this article.
2. Action On Application: Within thirty (30) days following receipt of a completed application for a certificate of zoning compliance,
the village manager shall cause the application and related submissions to be reviewed for compliance with this code and shall
inform the applicant whether the application has been granted or denied. In any case where an application is granted, the
manager shall issue a certificate of zoning compliance, which shall state on its face, in bold type, that:
THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT SIGNIFY BUILDING CODE REVIEW OR APPROVAL AND IS NOT AUTHORIZATION TO
UNDERTAKE ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND APPROVAL WHERE EITHER IS REQUIRED. SEE THE HINSDALE
BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
BEFORE ANY STRUCTURE TO WHICH THIS CERTIFICATE IS APPLICABLE MAY BE OCCUPIED OR USED FOR ANY
PURPOSE, A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY MUST BE OBTAINED. SEE SECTION 11-402 OF THE HINSDALE ZONING
CODE AND THE HINSDALE BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
In any case where an application is denied, the manager shall state the specific reasons therefor and shall cite the specific
provisions of this code upon which such denial is based. If relief from such demand would be available pursuant to a companion
application filed in connection with the application for a certificate of zoning compliance, the manager shall so inform the
applicant and shall promptly process such companion application. If such application is approved, the manager shall issue the
requested certificate of zoning compliance in accordance with the terms and conditions of such approval.
If relief from the manager's denial of a certificate of zoning compliance would be available by variation, special permit, or site plan
review, but no application therefor has been filed, the manager shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate
provisions of this code.
3. Contents Of Certificate: Each certificate of zoning compliance issued pursuant to this section shall state the specific use of the
subject property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set forth any
conditions imposed in connection with any approval granted pursuant to this code.
4. Filing Of Certificates: Every certificate issued pursuant to this section shall be kept on file in the office of the village manager and
shall be a public record open to inspection in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois freedom of information act.
F. Effect Of Issuance Of Certificate Of Zoning Compliance: The issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance shall not authorize the
establishment, expansion, or extension of any use nor the development, construction, relocation, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any additional permits and
approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the village, including, but not limited to, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
G. Limitations On Certificates: Subject to an extension of time granted by the village manager pursuant to subsection 11-101K of this
article, a certificate of zoning compliance shall become null and void twelve (12) months for single-family detached structures and
eighteen (18) months for multiple-family and commercial structures after the date on which it was issued unless within such period
construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced.
H. Void Certificates: Any certificate of zoning compliance issued in violation of the provisions of this code, whether intentionally,
negligently, or innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever. (1991 Code; Ord. O2006-82, § 2, 11-28-
2006; Ord. O2015-09, 3-17-2015)
Sec. 11-402:Certificate Of Occupancy:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 556/605
A. Authority: The village manager shall have authority to issue certificates of occupancy; provided, however, that no such certificate
shall be issued except in accordance with the provisions of this section and the provisions of the village code of Hinsdale governing
development, building, and related matters.
B. Purpose: For the purposes of this code, the certificate of occupancy provides a procedure for the inspection of completed premises
to ensure their compliance with this code and approved plans prior to commencement of the use or occupancy of such premises.
The certificate may also evidence compliance with other provisions of the village code of Hinsdale as set forth in those provisions.
C. Certificate Required: Unless a certificate of occupancy shall have first been obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of
this code:
1. No structure, or addition thereto, constructed, reconstructed, remodeled, altered, or moved after the effective date of this code
shall be occupied or used for any purpose; and
2. No land vacant as of the effective date of this code shall be used or occupied for any purpose, except the raising of crops; and
3. Except for changes involving only substitution of occupants in existing dwelling units, no use or occupancy of any land or
structure shall be changed to any other use or occupancy, whether or not construction, remodeling, alteration, or moving is
involved; and
4. No home occupation shall be established.
This subsection shall not apply to signs regulated by section 9-106 of this code.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: When no certificate of zoning compliance is required, applications for certificate of occupancy shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this article. When a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued, the
application for that certificate shall also be treated as the application for a certificate of occupancy and shall be processed as
such at such time as the applicant notifies the village manager in writing that the subject structure or use is ready for a certificate
of occupancy in accordance with the certificate of zoning compliance.
In any case where the structure or use involved has been constructed or established pursuant to any approval granted pursuant
to this code, the application shall be accompanied by "as built" plans depicting the structure or use as built and bearing the
certificate of a surveyor, engineer, architect, land planner, or owner-designer, as may be appropriate, certifying that the structure
or use as built conforms in all respects to the approval granted.
2. Action On Application: Within ten (10) days following the receipt of a completed application, the village manager shall cause the
subject structure or premises to be inspected and shall take one of the following actions based on such inspection:
(a) If all work has been completed and the structure and use thereof are in full and complete compliance with all applicable
provisions of this code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the village, the applicant's plans as approved, and any conditions
attached to any approval issued pursuant to this code, the village manager shall issue a certificate of occupancy.
(b) If, however, all work is not complete or is in any manner not in full compliance with all applicable requirements, the village
manager shall deny the application and shall inform the applicant in writing of the specific deficiencies on which such denial is
based, citing the particular provisions of the codes and ordinances of the village, the particular items in the applicant's plans or
the applicable special approval conditions with respect to which compliance is lacking.
3. Contents Of Certificate: In addition to the matters required to be contained in a certificate of occupancy pursuant to other
applicable provisions of the village code, each certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this section shall state the specific use
of the subject property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set
forth any conditions imposed in connection with any approval granted pursuant to this code.
4. Filing Of Certificates: Every certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this section shall be kept on file in the office of the village
manager and shall be a public record open to inspection pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois freedom of information act.
E. Temporary Certificate Of Occupancy: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection D2 of this Section, when construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration of a structure does not require the vacating of the structure, or when parts of the structure
are finished and ready for occupancy before the completion of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration and are
certified upon inspection to be safe for use or occupancy and to be in full compliance with all applicable provisions of this Code,
other relevant codes and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans as approved and any conditions attached to any approvals
issued pursuant to this Code with respect to such structure or its premises, a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued
for a period not to exceed six months from its date, which Temporary Certificate shall bear on its face, in bold type, a statement of
its temporary nature; provided, however, that no such Temporary Certificate shall be issued pursuant to this Code unless said
structure also qualifies for a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy issued pursuant to the Hinsdale Building Code.

F. Certificate of occupancy for existing uses. The Village Manager may issue a Certificate of Occupancy certifying the lawful existence
and use of any existing structure or use in the same manner, and subject to the same standards and limitations, as authorized by
this Section with respect to new structures and uses. Such Certificate of Occupancy shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
contained in it with respect to any structure or use as of the date of its issue and remain effective for that purpose for so long as
neither the use or structure nor the applicable provisions of this Code are changed.
G. Void certificates. Any Certificate of Occupancy issued in violation of the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently, or
innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.
Article 5. Interpretations, Appeals, And Variations
Sec. 11-501:Interpretations:
A. Authority. The Village Manager, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of this Section, may render interpretations,
including use interpretations, of the provisions of this Code and of any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it.
B. Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this Section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Code, though
detailed and lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations,
however, can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Code in light of the general and specific
purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority herein established is an
administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential content of this Code but rather
is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
C. Parties entitled to seek interpretations. Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having an interest in the
circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation; provided, however, that interpretations shall not be sought by any
person based solely on hypothetical facts or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for interpretations of this Code shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 11-301 of
this Code.
2. Action on application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a properly completed application for interpretation, the Village
Manager shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis
upon which the determination is based. The failure of the Manager to act within 30 days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the application rendered on the day following such 30-day
period.
3. Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Village Manager may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided
in Section 11-502 of this Code.
E. Standards for use interpretations. The following standards shall govern the Village Manager, and the Zoning Board of Appeals on
appeals from the Manager, in issuing use interpretations:
1. No use interpretation shall be given with respect to the residential districts.
2. Any use defined in Section 12-206 of this Code shall be interpreted as therein defined.
3. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use or a special permit use in any district to be established in any
district in which such use is not so listed.
4. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply
with each use limitation established for that particular district.
5. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in
such district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or specially permitted in a more restrictive district.
6. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special use in the district in which it is proposed to be located,
then any use interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a special use permit for such use
pursuant to Section 11-602 of this Code.
7. No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the
district in question.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 558/605
8. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, in rendering use interpretations the Village Manager shall be guided by the
Standard Industrial Classification Manual and the use classification methodology used therein.
F. Effect of favorable use interpretation. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a
particular district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or
moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits
and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a special use permit, a
Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy, subdivision approval, and Site Plan approval.
G. Limitations on favorable use interpretations. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code, no use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall
be valid for a period longer than six months from the date of issue unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained and a use
commenced within that period.
A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use
for which a separate use interpretation has not been issued. Such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or
effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or
more.
Sec. 11-502:Appeals:
A. Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the
failure to act, of the Village Manager acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this Code and to that end the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall have the same powers and be subject to the same standards and limitations as the village manager with
respect to any order, decision, or determination being appealed.
B. Purpose: The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, ill considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It
is intended to avoid the need for resort to legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It
is not, however, intended as a means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this code or the rightful authority of the
village manager to enforce the requirements of this code. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all proper deference to the
spirit and intent embodied in the language of this code and to the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with
the administration of this code.
C. Parties Entitled To Appeal: An application for appeal to the zoning board of appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved or
adversely affected by an order, decision, determination, or failure to act of the village manager acting pursuant to his or her
authority and duties under this code.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: An application for appeal to the zoning board of appeals shall be filed not later than forty five (45) days following the
action being appealed and in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this article.
2. Action By Village Manager: Upon receipt of a properly completed application for an appeal, the village manager shall forthwith
transmit to the zoning board of appeals the application together with all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
3. Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
4. Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals: Within thirty (30) days following the close of the public hearing, the zoning board of appeals
shall render a decision on the appeal in the manner and form specified in subsection 11-102H of this article. Such decision may
reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or determination as, in the
opinion of the board of appeals, is proper to be made in the premises. The failure of the board of appeals to act within such thirty
(30) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the appeal.
E. Stay Of Proceedings: An application for appeal properly filed pursuant to subsection D of this section shall stay all proceedings in
the furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the village manager certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the application
for appeal has been filed with the manager that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the manager's opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the board of appeals or by the circuit court on application, upon reasonable written notice to the manager and
on due cause shown.

F. Right To Grant Variation In Deciding Appeals: In any case where the application for appeal is accompanied by an application for
variation in accordance with section 11-503 of this part, the zoning board of appeals shall have the authority to grant, as part of the
relief, a variation, but only in strict compliance with each provision of said section 11-503 of this part.
G. Conditions And Limitations On Rights Granted By Appeal: In any case where this code imposes conditions and limitations upon any
right, any such right granted by the zoning board of appeals on appeal shall be subject to such conditions and limitations in the
same manner and to the same extent as if secured without the necessity of an appeal. (1991 Code)
Sec. 11-503:Variations:
A. Authority: The zoning board of appeals shall have the authority to grant variations from the provisions of this code, but only in
compliance with the procedures set forth in subsection D of this section and in those specific instances enumerated in subsection E
of this section and then only in accordance with each of the standards enumerated in subsection F of this section. The board of
trustees shall have the authority to grant variations from the provisions of this code that are not specifically reserved with the zoning
board of appeals pursuant to subsection E of this section in accordance with each of the standards set forth in subsections E2 and
F of this section, but only after a public hearing before the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the requirements of section 11-301
of this article and a recommendation by the zoning board of appeals to grant or deny the requested variation. In such instances, the
zoning board of appeals shall issue its recommendation within thirty five (35) days of the close of the public hearing in the manner
and form specified by subsection 11-102H of this article. The failure of the zoning board of appeals to act within thirty five (35) days,
or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation to deny the variation. If the zoning
board of appeals does not approve, with at least four (4) affirmative votes, the requested variation, the board of trustees cannot
approve the requested variation.
B. Purpose: The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from
unforeseen particular applications of this code that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. When such difficulties or
hardships are more appropriate for remedy, if at all, pursuant to other provisions of this article, the variation procedure is
necessarily inappropriate.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Variations: Applications for variations may be filed by the owner of, or person having a contractual interest
in, the subject property.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: Applications for variations shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this article.
2. Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section
11-303 of this article.
3. Action By Zoning Board Of Appeals: Within thirty five (35) days following the close of the public hearing, the zoning board of
appeals shall render its decision granting or denying the variation, in the manner and form specified by subsection 11-102H of
this article. The failure of the zoning board of appeals to act within thirty five (35) days, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the variation.
E. Authorized Variations:
1. Permitted Variations: The zoning board of appeals may vary the provisions of this code only as provided in this subsection E1.
The authority of the zoning board of appeals to vary the provisions of this code are subject to the prohibitions set forth in
subsection E2 of this section and proof by the applicant of each of the standards set forth in subsection F of this section.
Under no circumstances shall the list of permitted variations in this subsection E1 be construed as an entitlement, right, or claim
for any applicant.
The zoning board of appeals may vary the provisions of this code in the following cases and in no others:
(a) To reduce the dimension of any required yard, setback, or building spacing, and to allow structures and uses to be located in
any required yard in addition to, and to a greater degree than, those authorized by applicable district regulations.
(b) To reduce by not more than ten percent (10%) the required lot width or lot depth of any lot; provided, however, that no such
variation shall permit either the development of more than one dwelling unit in addition to the number of dwelling units that
could be developed in the absence of such a variation or any increase in the otherwise permitted maximum floor area ratio.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 560/605
(c) To reduce by not more than ten percent (10%) the required lot area of any lot, and to reduce by fifteen percent (15%) the lot
area of any lot meeting all of the following criteria: 1) the subject lot is a legal nonconforming lot of record created by plat or
deed recorded before 1923; 2) the subject lot was vacant on January 1, 1991, or became vacant thereafter by reason of
demolition or destruction of a precode structure that is not authorized to be rebuilt or replaced pursuant to subsection 10-104C
of this code; 3) the subject lot has not, at any time after 1960, immediately abutted a vacant lot with the same owner as the
subject lot when the combination of the vacant lot with the subject lot would have created a lot meeting the lot size standards
then applicable to the subject lot; and 4) the subject lot has not immediately abutted any vacant lot since January 1, 1991. No
variation pursuant to this subsection shall permit either the development of more than one dwelling unit in addition to the
number of dwelling units that could be developed in the absence of such a variation or any increase in the otherwise permitted
maximum floor area ratio.
(d) To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum allowable height of a structure in a nonresidential district, but
only where necessary to accommodate variations in grade.
(e) To reduce by not more than twenty percent (20%), or one space, whichever is greater, the minimum number of off street
parking spaces or loading spaces otherwise required.
(f) To vary the number of parking or loading spaces required in connection with a change of use or an increase in use intensity.
(g) To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the maximum distance that required parking is permitted to be located

(h) To allow an increase in height by not more than twenty percent (20%) of the maximum allowable height for the illumination of
residential recreational facilities.
(i) To allow the moving of a precode structure to an extent or in a manner not permitted by subsection 10-104E of this code.
(j) To allow the otherwise prohibited restoration of a partially damaged or destroyed precode structure or structure devoted to a
nonconforming use.
(k) To vary the bulk, yard, and space requirements when a zoning lot, whether vacant or legally used, is reduced in size, by
reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by an authorized governmental body or by reason of a conveyance made
under the specific threat of an eminent domain proceeding, so that the remainder of said zoning lot, or any structure or use on
said zoning lot, does not conform with one or more of such bulk, yard, or space requirements of the district in which said
zoning lot is located.
(l) To allow, for a period not to extend beyond four (4) years following the effective date of this code:
(i) The storage in a parking area in a residential district of more than the maximum number of class I or II vehicles specified in
subsection 9-101D4(e) of this code; or
(ii) The storage in a parking area in any required yard in a residential district of class II vehicles; or
(iii) The storage in a parking area in a residential district of no more than one class III vehicle; or
(iv) The provision of buffers and landscaping for class II vehicles other than those required by subsection 9-107D of this code.
Every variation granted pursuant to this subsection E1(l) shall run only to the applicant, as a personal privilege, and only with
respect to the specific vehicle that is the subject of the application.
(m) To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the maximum floor area ratio permitted in the R-1 single-family
residential district for any proposed development that was the subject of a variation application filed with the village and

(n) To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum floor area ratio permitted in the B-2 central business district.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 561/605
(o) To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum building coverage permitted in the B-2 central business district.
(p) To increase the maximum elevation permitted in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 single-family residential districts.
(q) To increase by not more than fifteen percent (15%) the maximum allowable height of a personal wireless services antenna
support structure that is of a tower design.
(r) To allow the front of a single-family dwelling to be developed to face a frontage other than the frontage it is required to face
pursuant to subsection 3-110I of this code.
(s) To reduce by more than ten percent (10%) the required lot width and area of any lot created concurrent with and as part of the
terms of an annexation agreement for the land of which the lot is a part. No variation pursuant to this subsection shall permit
either the development of more than one dwelling unit in addition to the number of dwelling units that could be developed in the
absence of such a variation or any increase in the otherwise permitted maximum floor area ratio.
(t) To increase the maximum floor area ratio not more than the minimum amount required to authorize construction on property in
the R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4 districts of a four hundred forty (440) square foot detached garage accessory to an existing singlefamily
detached dwelling on the subject property, but only to replace an existing attached garage and only if all of the following
criteria are met: 1) the existing garage is the only garage on the subject property, 2) the existing garage is unusable as a
garage, in the determination of the director of public services based on reasonable evidence provided by the applicant,
because of flooding outside of the reasonable control or correction of the subject property owner, 3) the proposed detached
garage will not exceed a total floor area of four hundred forty (440) square feet and will comply with every other applicable
provision of this code, 4) the floor area ratio and building coverage of the subject property has not been increased by
expansion of the single-family dwelling for at least ten (10) years prior to the date of application for the variation.
2. Prohibited Variations: Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no variation shall be granted that:
(a) Is intended as a temporary measure only; or
(b) Is greater than the minimum variation necessary to relieve the particular hardship or practical difficulty demonstrated by the
applicant.
F. Standards For Variations:
1. General Standard: No variation shall be granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the
strict letter of the provisions of this code would create a particular hardship or a practical difficulty. Such a showing shall require
proof that the variation being sought satisfies each of the standards set forth in this subsection F.
2. Unique Physical Condition: The subject property is exceptional as compared to other lots subject to the same provision by
reason of a unique physical condition, including presence of an existing use, structure, or sign, whether conforming or
nonconforming; irregular or substandard shape or size; exceptional topographical features; or other extraordinary physical
conditions peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and that
relate to or arise out of the lot rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot.
3. Not Self-Created: The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the result of any action or inaction of the owner, or of the
owner's predecessors in title and known to the owner prior to acquisition of the subject property, and existed at the time of the
enactment of the provisions from which a variation is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of governmental
action, other than the adoption of this code, for which no compensation was paid.
4. Denied Substantial Rights: The carrying out of the strict letter of the provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the
owner of the subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other lots subject to the same provision.
5. Not Merely Special Privilege: The alleged hardship or difficulty is not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some
special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely an
inability to make more money from the use of the subject property; provided, however, that where the standards herein set out
exist, the existence of an economic hardship shall not be a prerequisite to the grant of an authorized variation.
6. Code And Plan Purposes: The variation would not result in a use or development of the subject property that would be not in
harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this code and the provision from which a variation is sought were
enacted or the general purpose and intent of the official comprehensive plan.
7. Essential Character Of The Area: The variation would not result in a use or development on the subject property that:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 562/605
(a) Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or value of
property or improvements permitted in the vicinity; or
(b) Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to the properties and improvements in the vicinity; or
(c) Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets due to traffic or parking; or
(d) Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire; or
(e) Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area; or
(f) Would endanger the public health or safety.
8. No Other Remedy: There is no means other than the requested variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be
avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject property.
G. Variation Less Than Requested: A variation less than or different from that requested may be granted when the record supports the
applicant's right to some relief but not to the relief requested.
H. Conditions On Variations: The zoning board of appeals, or the board of trustees as the case may be, may impose such specific
conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to
the purposes and objectives of this code upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent
or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities
and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the variation. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variation.
I. Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions: Whenever any variation authorized pursuant to this section is made subject to conditions
and limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall upon meeting such conditions file an affidavit with the village manager
so stating.
J. Effect Of Grant Of Variation: The grant of a variation shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approval that may be required by the codes and ordinances
of the village including, but not limited to, a certificate of zoning compliance, a building permit, a certificate of occupancy,
subdivision approval, and site plan approval.
K. Limitations On Variations: Subject to an extension of time granted by the village manager pursuant to subsection 11-101K of this
article, no variation from the provisions of this code shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit is
issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a certificate
of occupancy is issued and a use is commenced within that period.
A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or development for which it was issued and shall
automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such construction or development shall be removed and not replaced
within six (6) months following such removal. (Ord. O2010-51, 10-19-2010)
Article 6. Amendments And Special Approvals
Sec. 11-601:Amendments:
A. Authority: This code and the zoning map may be amended from time to time by ordinance duly enacted by the board of trustees in
accordance with the procedures set out in this section.
B. Purpose: The amendment process established by this section is intended to provide a means for making changes in the text of this
code and in the zoning map that have more or less general significance or application. It is not intended to relieve particular
hardships nor to confer special privileges or rights. Rather, it is intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of this code and the
zoning map in light of changing, newly discovered, or newly important conditions, situations, or knowledge.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 563/605
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Amendments: An application for an amendment may be filed by the board of trustees, the plan
commission, the zoning board of appeals, the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, any property to be affected
by a proposed amendment to the zoning map, or any person interested in a proposed amendment to the text of this code.
D. Procedure:
1.Application: Applications for amendments shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this article;
provided, however, that amendments proposed by the board of trustees, the plan commission or the zoning board of appeals
shall not be subject to said section but shall be transmitted to the village manager in such form as may seem appropriate to the
initiating body.
2.Preliminary Consideration By Board Of Trustees:
(a)Referral To Board: Every properly filed and completed application for an amendment to this code, before being processed in
any other manner, shall be referred to the board of trustees for a determination as to whether the application merits a hearing
and consideration by the plan commission or should be summarily denied.
(b)Notice Of Applicant; Right To Be Heard: Notice of the meeting at which the issue will be considered shall be given to the
applicant at least forty eight (48) hours before such meeting and the applicant or his representative shall, subject to the rules of
the board of trustees, have the right to be heard on the issue.
(c)Action By Board: The board of trustees, not later than the first meeting after the meeting at which the issue first appears on its
agenda, shall either summarily deny the application or refer it to the plan commission for public hearing. The affirmative vote of
four (4) members of the board of trustees shall be necessary to summarily deny an application; any other vote shall be
sufficient to refer the application for a hearing. In the case of any such referral, the date of such referral shall be deemed to be
the date of filing for computation of all time periods under this code. A summary denial shall have the same legal effect as a
denial after a full hearing.
(d)Standard: In considering the issue of whether to summarily deny or refer an application for hearing, the board of trustees shall
be guided by the legislative standard that applies to granting an application for an amendment as set forth in subsection E of
this section. The board of trustees should summarily deny an application in any case where its legislative judgment is that the
standard cannot be met with regard to the proposed amendment.
3.Public Hearing: In any case where an application for amendment is referred to the plan commission for a hearing, a public
hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section 11-303 of this article.
4.Action By Plan Commission: Within forty five (45) days following the conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall
transmit to the board of trustees its recommendation in the form specified by subsection 11-103H of this article. The failure of the
plan commission to act within forty five (45) days following the conclusion of such hearing, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the proposed amendment as submitted.
5.Action By Board Of Trustees; Protest: Within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission,
or its failure to act as above provided, the board of trustees shall either deny the application or, by ordinance duly adopted, adopt
the proposed amendment, with or without modifications; provided, however, that in the event a duly signed and acknowledged
protest against a proposed amendment is filed with the village clerk before the adoption of such amendment by the owners of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage to be affected by the proposed amendment, or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be affected, such amendment shall not be passed except by a two-thirds
(2/3) vote of all the trustees then holding office.
The failure of the board of trustees to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying the application.
E. Standard For Amendments: The wisdom of amending the zoning map or the text of this code is a matter committed to the sound
legislative discretion of the board of trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in determining whether a proposed
amendment should be granted or denied the board of trustees should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this code
is not an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only when the public good demands or requires the amendment to be made.
In considering whether that principle is satisfied in any particular case, the board of trustees should weigh, among other factors, the
following factors:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 564/605
1.The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this code.
2.The existing uses and zoning classifications for properties in the vicinity of the subject property.
3.The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property, including changes, if any, in such trend since the subject property
was placed in its present zoning classification.
4.The extent, if any, to which the value of the subject property is diminished by the existing zoning classification applicable to it.
5.The extent to which any such diminution in value is offset by an increase in the public health, safety, and welfare.
6.The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
7.The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
8.The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
9.The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or permissible under its present zoning classification.
10.The availability of adequate ingress to and egress from the subject property and the extent to which traffic conditions in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property would be affected by the proposed amendment.
11.The availability of adequate utilities and essential public services to the subject property to accommodate the uses permitted or
permissible under its present zoning classification.
12.The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been vacant, considered in the context of the pace of development in the
vicinity of the subject property.
13.The community need for the proposed amendment and for the uses and development it would allow.
14.The reasons, where relevant, why the subject property should be established as part of an overlay district and the positive and
negative effects such establishment could be expected to have on persons residing in the area. (1991 Code)
Sec. 11-602:Special Use Permits:
A. Authority: The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly
adopted, may grant special use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special uses in the regulations applicable to
the district in which the subject property is located.
B. Purpose: Special uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location,
design, configuration, and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the desirability of permitting their establishment on
any given site. They are uses that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing, in each case, of
the public need and benefit against the local impact and effect.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Special Use Permits: An application for a special use permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person
having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
D. Procedure:
1.Application: Applications for special use permits shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this
article.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 565/605
2.Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section 11-303
of this article.
3.Action By Plan Commission: Within forty five (45) days following the conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall
transmit to the board of trustees its recommendation in the form specified by subsection 11-103H of this article, recommending
either granting the application for a special use permit; granting the application subject to conditions, as specified in subsection F
of this section; or denying the application. The failure of the plan commission to act within forty five (45) days, or such further time
to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the proposed special use permit.
4.Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its
failure to act as above provided, the board of trustees shall either deny the application or, by ordinance duly adopted, shall grant
the special use permit, with or without modifications or conditions. The failure of the board of trustees to act within sixty (60)
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the special use permit.
E. Standards For Special Use Permits:
1.General Standards: No special use permit shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall
establish that:
(a)Code And Plan Purposes: The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for
which this code was enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were established and with the general
purpose and intent of the official comprehensive plan.
(b)No Undue Adverse Impact: The proposed use and development will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon
adjacent property, the character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(c)No Interference With Surrounding Development: The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and
operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in
accordance with the applicable district regulations.
(d)Adequate public facilities. The proposed use and development will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and
schools, or the applicant will provide adequately for such services.
(e)No traffic congestion. The proposed use and development will not cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts
of traffic through residential streets.
(f)No destruction of significant features. The proposed use and development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of
any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
(g)Compliance with standards. The proposed use and development complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the
particular provision of this Code authorizing such use.
2.Special standards for specified special uses. When the district regulations authorizing any special use in a particular district
impose special standards to be met by such use in such district, a permit for such use in such district shall not be recommended
or granted unless the applicant shall establish compliance with such special standards.
3.Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the
Plan Commission shall consider:
(a)Public benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed use and development at the particular location requested is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to
the general welfare of the neighborhood or community.
(b)Alternative locations. Whether and to what extent such public goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and
development at some other site or in some other area that may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 566/605
(c)Mitigation of adverse impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects
of the proposed use and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site design, landscaping, and
screening.
F. Conditions on special use permits. The Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions
and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this Code upon the premises benefitted by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or
minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and
services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
G. Affidavit of compliance with conditions. Whenever any special use permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to
conditions or limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an affidavit with the
Village Manager so stating.
H. Effect of issuance of a special use permit. The grant of a special use permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of
any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely
authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any other permits or approvals that may be required by the
codes and ordinances of the Village, including but not limited to a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a Building Permit, a Certificate
of Occupancy, and subdivision approval.
I.Limitations on special use permits. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection 11-101K of
this Code, no special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a Building Permit is issued and construction
is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued
and a use commenced within that period.
A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall
automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six
consecutive months or more.
Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance granting a special use permit, a special use permit shall be deemed to relate to,
and be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the owner or operator of such use or lot.
J. Amendments to special use permits. A special use permit may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and
subject to the standards and limitations provided in this Section for its original approval.
Sec. 11-603:Planned developments:
A. Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this Section and by ordinance duly
adopted, may grant special use permits authorizing the development of planned developments, but only in the districts where such
developments are listed as an authorized special use.
B. Purpose. Planned developments are included in this Code as a distinct category of special use. As such, they are authorized for the
same general purposes as all other special uses. In particular, however, the planned development technique is intended to allow
the relaxation of otherwise applicable substantive requirements based upon procedural protections providing for detailed review of
individual proposals for significant developments. This special regulatory technique is included in this Code in recognition of the fact
that traditional bulk, space, and yard regulations that may be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed and
stable areas may impose inappropriate pre-regulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas
that lend themselves to an individual, planned approach. Through the flexibility of the planned development technique, the Village
seeks to achieve the following specific objectives:
1. Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible through strict application of other Village land use regulations.
2. Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in better design and development,
including aesthetic amenities.
3. Combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships.
4. Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features,
the provision of screening or other facilities that benefit neighboring properties, and the prevention of soil erosion.
5. Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 567/605
6. An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result from the application of conventional subdivision and
zoning regulations.
7. Encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
C. Parties entitled to seek planned development approval. An application for a special permit to permit a planned development may be
filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
D. Procedure.
1. Development concept plan.
(a) Purpose. The Development Concept Plan is intended to provide the applicant an opportunity to submit a plan showing the
basic scope, character, and nature of the entire proposed planned development without incurring undue cost. The
Development Concept Plan is the basis on which the required public hearing is held, thus permitting public consideration of the
proposal at the earliest possible stage.
To permit the Village and the applicant to proceed with some assurance, approval of the Development Concept Plan binds the
applicant and the Village with respect to the following basic elements of development:
(i) Categories of uses to be permitted; and
(ii) General location of residential and nonresidential land uses; and
(iii) Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of nonresidential uses; and
(iv) The general architectural style of the proposed development; and
(v) General location and extent of public and private open space including recreational amenities; and
(vi) General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems; and
(vii) Staging of development; and
(viii) Nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements, or contributions to be provided by the applicant.
(b) Application. Applications for approval of a Development Concept Plan shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of
Section 11-301 of this Article XI.
(c) Public hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 11-
303 of this Code.
(d) Action by plan commission. Within 45 days following the conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit
to the Board of Trustees its recommendation, in the form specified by Subsection 11-103F of this Code, that the Development
Concept Plan either be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be approved. The failure of the Plan
Commission to act within 45 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation
for the approval of the Development Concept Plan as submitted.
(e) Action by board of trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission or its failure
to act as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall deny the application for approval of the Development Concept Plan, or
shall refer it back to the Plan Commission for further consideration of specified matters, or, by ordinance duly adopted, shall
approve the Development Concept Plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a
condition of such approval, and shall grant a special use permit authorizing the proposed planned development and such
additional approvals as may be necessary to permit development of the planned development as approved; provided,
however, that every such ordinance and special use permit shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of Detailed and Final
Plans in accordance with Paragraphs D3 and D4 of this Section and upon the permittee's compliance with all provisions of this
Code and the ordinance granting the special use permit.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 568/605
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
to be a decision denying approval of the Development Concept Plan.
(f) Effect of development concept plan approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing Detailed and Final
Plans or shall fail to proceed with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other manner fail to
comply with any condition of this Code or any approval granted pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the consent of the
applicant, take any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise impair an approved Development Concept Plan with respect to the
elements of development set forth in Subparagraph D1(a) of this Section pending the application for approval of Detailed and
Final Plans. In submitting such plans, the applicant shall be bound by the approved Development Concept Plan with respect to
each such element.
(g) Limitation on development concept plan approval. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to
Subsection 11-101K of this Code, unless a Detailed Plan covering at least the area designated in the Development Concept
Plan as the first stage or unit of the planned development has been filed within one year from the date the Board of Trustees
grants Development Concept Plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file Detailed and Final Plans and to
proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the approved Development Concept Plan, the
approval shall automatically expire and be rendered void and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an
appropriate application to revoke the special permit for all portions of the planned development area that have not yet been
completed.
2. Optional submission of a detailed plan. The applicant may, at his or her option, submit a Detailed Plan for the proposed planned
development pursuant to the requirements of Paragraph D3 of this Section simultaneously with the submission of the
Development Concept Plan pursuant to the requirements of Paragraph D1 of this Section. In such case, the applicant shall
comply with all provisions of this Code applicable to submission of the Development Concept Plan and to submission of the
Detailed Plan. The Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees shall consider such plans simultaneously and shall grant or deny
Detailed Plan approval in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph D3 of this Section.
3. Detailed plan.
(a) Purpose. The Detailed Plan is intended to particularize, refine, and implement the Development Concept Plan and to serve as
a working document in development of a Final Plan. The Detailed Plan may be submitted for the entire planned development
or in stages as approved in the Development Concept Plan.
(b) Application. Upon approval of the Development Concept Plan, and within the time limits established in Subparagraph D1(g) of
this Section, the applicant shall file an application for Detailed Plan approval in accordance with the requirements of Section
11-301 of this Code. The application may include the entire area included in the approved Development Concept Plan or one
or more stages or units thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the Development Concept Plan. The
application shall refine, implement, and be in substantial conformity with the approved Development Concept Plan.
(c) Public meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 11-
303 of this Code.
(d) Coordination with subdivision ordinance. When a subdivision of land subject to the Hinsdale Subdivision Ordinance is
proposed in connection with a planned development, review of the tentative plat of the proposed subdivision shall be carried
out simultaneously with review of the Detailed Plan.
(e) Action by plan commission.
(i) Evaluation. Within 60 days following the filing of an application for approval of a Detailed Plan, the Plan Commission shall,
with such aid and advice of the Village staff and consultants as may be appropriate, review and act on the plan. Such review
shall consider:
(1) Whether the Detailed Plan is in substantial conformity with the approved Development Concept Plan; and
(2) The merit or lack of merit of any departure of the Detailed Plan from substantial conformity with the approved
Development Concept Plan; and
(3) Whether the Detailed Plan complies with any and all conditions imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan;
and
(4) Whether the Detailed Plan complies with the provisions of this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 569/605
(ii) Approval based on substantial conformity. If the plan Commission finds substantial conformity between the Detailed Plan
and the approved Development Concept Plan and further finds the Detailed Plan to be in all other respects complete and in
compliance with any and all conditions imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan and with the provisions of
this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations, it shall transmit the plan to
the Board of Trustees with its recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection 11-103F of this Code, that the Board of
Trustees approve the Detailed Plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a
condition of approval; provided, however, that in no event shall such conditions of approval impair the rights granted by the
Development Concept Plan approval. See Subsection 12-206S of this Code for the definition of "substantial conformity."
(iii) Recommendation of approval without substantial conformity. If the Plan Commission finds that the Detailed Plan lacks
substantial conformity to the Development Concept Plan but merits approval notwithstanding such lack of conformity and
otherwise conforms to the requirements of this Code, it shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its
recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection 11-103F of this Code, that the Detailed Plan be approved, with or
without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of approval.
(iv) Recommendation of denial. If the Plan Commission finds that the Detailed Plan is not in substantial conformity with the
approved Development Concept Plan and does not merit approval, or if the Plan Commission requires modifications of a
plan that are not accepted by the applicant, the Plan Commission shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees together
with its recommendation, in the form specified in Subsection 11-103F of this Code, that the Detailed Plan not be approved.
(v) Failure to act. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation to the Board of Trustees to approve the Detailed Plan as submitted.
(f) Action by board of trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure
to act as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall either:
(i) Approval based on substantial conformity. If the Plan Commission has recommended approval of a Detailed Plan pursuant
to Subparagraph D3(e)(ii) of this Section, the Board of Trustees shall, unless it specifically rejects one or more of the findings
of the Plan Commission on the basis of expressly stated reasons, approve the Detailed Plan by a duly adopted ordinance; or
(ii) Approval without substantial conformity. In any case other than that specified in Subparagraph D3(f)(i) of this Section, the
Board of Trustees may, if it finds that the Detailed Plan merits approval and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this
Code, approve the Detailed Plan by a duly adopted ordinance; or
(iii) Referral back to plan commission. In any case other than that specified in Subparagraph D3(f)(i) of this Section, the Board
of Trustees may refer the Detailed Plan back to the Plan Commission for further consideration of specified matters; or
(iv) Conditions on detailed plan approval. Every approval of a Detailed Plan shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of a
Final Plan in accordance with Paragraph D4 of this Section and upon the applicant's compliance with all provisions of this
Code, of the ordinance granting Development Concept Plan approval and of the ordinance granting Detailed Plan approval.
The approval of any Detailed Plan may, in addition, be granted with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted
by the applicant as a condition of approval; provided, however, that in no event shall such conditions of approval impair the
rights granted by the Development Concept Plan Approval.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
to be a decision denying Detailed Plan approval.
(g) Effect of detailed plan approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing Final Plans or shall fail to
proceed with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any
condition of this Code or any approval granted pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the consent of the applicant, take
any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise impair an approved Detailed Plan pending the application for approval of a Final
Plan. In submitting a Final Plan, the applicant shall be bound by the approved Detailed Plan.
(h) Limitation on detailed plan approval. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Village Manager pursuant to Subsection
11-101K of this Code unless a Final Plan covering at least the area designated in the Detailed Plan as the first stage or unit of
the planned development has been filed within three months from the date the Detailed Plan is approved, or in any case where
the applicant fails to file a Final Plan and to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the
approved Detailed Plan, the approval and all other approvals of the planned development and all permits based on such
approvals shall automatically expire and be rendered void, and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an
appropriate application to revoke the special use permit for all portions of the planned development area that have not yet
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 570/605
been completed.
(i) Site improvements; model buildings. At any time following the approval of a Detailed Plan, the applicant may, pursuant to and
subject to the limitations of all applicable codes and ordinances of the Village, apply for and receive grading permits and
approvals necessary for the installation of utility and street improvements within the area of the planned development for which
Detailed Plan approval has been given.
If expressly authorized in the approval of the Detailed Plan, the applicant may, pursuant to and subject to the limitations of all
applicable codes and ordinances of the Village, apply for and receive building permits for model buildings to be constructed
within the area of the planned development shown on the approved Detailed Plan.
4. Final plan.
(a) Purpose. The Final Plan is to serve as a complete, thorough, and permanent public record of the planned development and
the manner in which it is to be developed. When properly utilized, Final Plan approval is essentially a clerical step in the
planned development process. The documentation required to be submitted with the Final Plan approval application is
intended to reflect in final form the approved planned development and to incorporate all prior approved plans and all
modifications thereof resulting from the planned development process.
(b) Application. Upon approval of the Detailed Plan, and within the time limits established in Subparagraph D3(h) of this Section,
the applicant shall file an application for Final Plan approval in accordance with the requirements of Section 11-301 of this
Code. The application may include the entire area included in the approved Detailed Plan or one or more stages or units
thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the Development Concept Plan. The application shall add
necessary detail to, and put in final form, the information contained in the approved Detailed Plan and shall conform to the
approved Detailed Plan in all respects.
(c) Coordination with subdivision ordinance. When a subdivision of land subject to the Hinsdale Subdivision Ordinance is
proposed in connection with a planned development, review of the final plat of subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously
with review of the Final Plan. (d) Final Plan Review. Within 21 days following the filing of an application for Final Plan approval,
the Village Manager shall cause to be initiated and completed a staff review of the Final Plan to determine its conformity to the
approved Detailed Plan and its compliance with any conditions imposed by the approval of the Detailed Plan and with the
provisions of this Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(d) Final plan review. Within 21 days following the filing of an application for Final Plan approval, the Village Manager shall cause
to be initiated and completed a staff review of the Final Plan to determine its conformity to the approved Detailed Plan and its
compliance with any conditions imposed by the approval of the Detailed Plan and with the provisions of this Code and all other
applicable federal, state, and village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
If the Manager shall find conformity in all significant respects between such plans, and shall further find the Final Plan to be in
all other respects complete and in compliance with any conditions imposed by the approval of the Detailed Plan and with this
Code and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations, then the Manager shall approve
the Final Plan for recording as herein provided.
If the Manager shall find that the Final Plan lacks such conformity, completeness, or compliance, then the Manager shall inform
the applicant of any deficiencies in the Final Plan and allow the applicant an opportunity to remedy such deficiencies. If the
applicant shall fail or refuse to remedy such deficiencies, then the Manager shall refer the Final Plan to the Plan Commission
and the Board of Trustees, which shall then review and approve or disapprove the Final Plan in the same manner and subject
to the same standards as provided in Subparagraphs D3(e) and (f) of this Section with respect to Detailed Plans.
(e) Recording of final plan. When a Final Plan is approved, the Village Manager shall cause the Final Plan, or the portions thereof
as are appropriate, to be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage or Cook County, whichever is appropriate.
(f) Limitation on final plan approval. Construction shall commence in accordance with the approved Final Plan within one year
after the approval of such plan, or within such shorter time as may be established by the approved development schedule.
Failure to commence construction within such period shall, unless an extension of time shall have been granted by the Village
Manager pursuant to Subsection 11-101K of this Code, automatically render void the Final Plan approval and all approvals of
the planned development and all permits based on such approvals, and the Manager shall, without further direction, initiate an
appropriate application to revoke the special use permit for all portions of the planned development that have not yet been
completed.
(g) Building and other permits. Except as provided in Subparagraph D3(i) of this Section, appropriate officials of the Village may
upon, but not before, receiving notice from the Village Manager that the documents required for Final Plan approval have been
approved, and upon proper application by the applicant, issue building and other permits to the applicant for the development,
construction, and other work in the area encompassed by the approved Final Plan; provided, however, that no permit shall be
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

issued unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of any codes or ordinances of the Village, in
addition to this Code, that are applicable to the permit sought, have been satisfied.
Building permits may, however, be withheld at the discretion of the Village Manager or the Board of Trustees at any time it is
determined that the development of the planned development is not proceeding in strict compliance with the approved Final
Plan.
E. Standards for planned developments.
1. Special use permit standards. No special use permit for a planned development shall be recommended or granted pursuant to
this Section unless the applicant shall establish that the proposed development will meet each of the standards made applicable
to special use permits pursuant to Subsection 11-602E of this Code.
2. Additional standards for all planned developments. No special use permit for a planned development shall be recommended or
granted unless the applicant shall establish that the proposed development will meet each of the following additional standards:
(a) Unified ownership required. The entire property proposed for planned development treatment shall be in single ownership or
under such unified control as to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a unified whole. All owners of the property
shall be included as joint applicants on all applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any owner as to
any tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owners and all tracts.
(b) Minimum area. The district regulations of this Code establishing standards for particular types of planned development
specify the minimum area required for some planned developments. In addition to meeting that specific standard, or where no
specific standard is set, the applicant shall have the burden of establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and
shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole capable of meeting the objectives for which planned developments may
be established pursuant to this Section.
(c) Covenants and restrictions to be enforceable by village. All covenants, deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions
to be recorded in connection with the planned development shall provide that they may not be modified, removed, or released
without the express consent of the Board of Trustees and that they may be enforced by the Village as well as by future
landowners within the proposed development.
(d) Public open space and contributions. Whenever the Official Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Map, or Official Map indicates that
development of a planned development will create a need for land for public purposes of the Village within the proposed
planned development, the Board of Trustees may require that such area be designated and to the extent such need is
specifically and uniquely attributable to the proposed development, dedicated to the Village for such use. In addition, the Board
of Trustees may require evidence that all requirements of Village ordinances pertaining to the dedication of land or the
contribution of cash in connection with subdivisions or developments of land have been met as respects the proposed planned
development.
(e) Common open space.
(i) Amount, location, and use. The failure of a planned development to provide common open space shall be considered to be
an indication that it has not satisfied the objectives for which such developments may be approved pursuant to this Code.
When common open space is provided in a planned development, the amount and location of such open space shall be
consistent with its intended function as set forth in the application and planned development plans. No such open space
shall be used for the construction of any structure or improvement except such structures and improvements as may be
approved in the Final Plan as appropriate to the intended leisure and recreational uses for which such open space is
intended.
(ii) Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants or dedication of development rights, shall be provided to
prevent the subsequent use of common open space for any use, structure, improvement, or development other than that
shown on the approved Final Plan. The restrictions must be permanent and not for a given period of years and must run with
the land. Such covenants and dedications may provide that they may be released, but only with the express written consent
of the Board of Trustees.
(iii) Ownership and maintenance. The Final Plan shall include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such
open space and improvements as are reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care, conservation, maintenance, and
operation in accordance with predetermined standards and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the Village
if such open space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or are not maintained in a condition consistent with the best
interests of the planned development or the Village.

(iv) Property owners' association. When the requirements of the preceding Subparagraph are to be satisfied by the ownership
or maintenance of such open space or improvements by a property owners' association, such association shall meet each of
the following standards:
(1) The by-laws and rules of the association and all declarations, covenants, and restrictions to be recorded must be
approved as part of the Detailed Plan prior to becoming effective. Each such document shall provide that it shall not be
amended in any manner that would result in it being in violation of the requirements of this subparagraph; and
(2) The association must be established and all covenants and restrictions must be recorded prior to the sale of any property
within the area of the planned development designated to have the exclusive use of the proposed open space or
improvements; and
(3) The association must be responsible for casualty and liability insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of the open space
and improvements to be deeded to it; and
(4) Membership in the association must be mandatory for each property owner and any successive owner having a right to
the use or enjoyment of such open space or improvements; and
(5) Every property owner having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open space or improvements must pay its pro rata
share of the cost of the association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association that meets the
requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with statutes of the state of Illinois; and
(6) The association must have the right to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs. The membership vote required to
authorize such adjustment shall not be fixed at more than two-thirds (2/3) of the members voting on the issue; and
(7) The village must be given the right to enforce the covenants; and
(8) The village must be given the right, after ten (10) days' written notice to the association, to perform any maintenance or
repair work that the association has neglected to perform, to assess the membership for such work and to have a lien
against the property of any member failing to pay such assessment. For this purpose alone, the village shall have all the
rights and powers of the association and its governing body under the agreements and declarations creating the
association.
(f) Landscaping And Perimeter Treatment: Any area of a planned development not used for structures or circulation elements
shall be landscaped or otherwise improved. The perimeter of the planned development shall be treated so as to ensure
compatibility with surrounding uses by means such as: provision of compatible uses and structures, setbacks, screening, or
natural or manmade buffers. Every planned development having twenty (20) or more acres shall provide a perimeter
landscaped open space along each of its boundaries; each such open space shall have a minimum depth equal to the
minimum front yard required in the district in which it is located or which it abuts, whichever is greater.
(g) Building And Spacing: No part of any building shall be closer to any part of any other building than ten feet (10'), or three feet
(3') if a fire separation wall has been provided satisfactory to the village manager, plus one-half foot (1/2') for each one foot (1')
by which either or both of such buildings exceed twenty five feet (25') in height.
(h) Private Streets: Private streets are prohibited unless expressly approved by the board of trustees. If so approved, they shall
meet all construction standards applicable to public streets. No such streets shall be approved except upon the condition that
they shall be owned and maintained by a property owners' association meeting the requirements set forth in subsection E2(e)
(iv) of this section.
(i) Sidewalks: A sidewalk meeting the standards of the Hinsdale subdivision ordinance shall be provided along at least one side
of every street in or abutting a planned development; provided, however, that such sidewalk may be constructed in a street
right of way or as a specific element of the design of the planned development.
(j) Utilities: All utility lines shall be installed underground.
3. Additional Standards For Specific Planned Developments: Where the district regulations authorizing any planned development
use in a particular district impose standards to be met by such planned development in such district, a special permit for such
development shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish compliance with such special standards.
F. Conditions On Planned Development Approvals: The approval of either a development concept plan or a detailed plan may be
conditioned on such matters as the approving body may find necessary to prevent or minimize any possible adverse effects of the
proposed planned development, or to ensure its compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency with the
general purposes, goals, and objectives of this code, the Hinsdale subdivision ordinance, and the official comprehensive plan;
provided, however, that no such condition of detailed plan approval shall impair the rights granted by development concept plan
approval. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance or resolution granting the approval in question. Violation of
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 573/605
any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted
for the planned development.
G. Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions: Whenever any planned development approval granted pursuant to this section is made
subject to conditions or limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant, upon meeting such conditions, shall file an affidavit with
the village manager so stating.
H. Authority To Vary Regulations:
1. Authority: Subject to the standards and limitations hereinafter set forth, the board of trustees shall have the authority, in
connection with the granting of any planned development approval pursuant to this section, to change, alter, vary, modify, or
waive any provisions of the village code of Hinsdale and the Hinsdale zoning code as they apply to an approved planned
development.
2. Standards: No such change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver shall be approved unless the board of trustees shall find
that the proposed planned development:
(a) Will achieve the purposes for which planned developments may be approved pursuant to subsection B of this section; and
(b) Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this code and the official comprehensive plan; and
(c) Will result in a development providing compensating amenities to the village.
3. Limitations: Except as provided in subsection H4 of this section, no such change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver
shall be permitted with respect to the uses permitted in any district or with respect to any standard established by subsection E of
this section or with respect to any standard made specifically applicable to planned developments by the regulations of any
particular district unless such regulations expressly authorize such a change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver.
4. Cumulative Authority: The variation authority created by this subsection shall be in addition to the variation authority created by
section 11-503 of this article.
I. Regulation During And Following Completion Of Development: Following final plan approval, the final plan, rather than any other
provision of this code, shall constitute the use, parking, loading, sign, bulk, space, and yard regulations applicable to the subject
property, and no use or development, other than home occupation and temporary uses, not allowed by the final plan shall be
permitted within the area of the planned development pursuant to the zoning district regulations otherwise applicable to such area.
J. Inspections During Development:
1. Inspections By Village Manager: Following approval of the final plan of a planned development or any stage thereof, the village
manager, at least annually until the completion of development, shall review all permits issued and construction undertaken and
compare actual development with the approved plans for development and with the approved development schedule.
2. Action By Village Manager: If the village manager finds that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved
schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the final plan, the manager shall immediately notify the board of
trustees of such fact and may, if necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare or to prevent further violation of this
code and the final plan, issue an order stopping any and all work on the planned development until such time as any
noncompliance is cured.
3. Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days following notification by the village manager, the board of trustees shall
either:
(a) Take such steps as it deems necessary to compel compliance with the final plan; or
(b) Require the owner or applicant to seek an adjustment to the final plan during development as provided in subsection K of this
section.
4. Revocation: Failure of the board of trustees to act within the aforesaid sixty (60) days shall, unless the owner or applicant shall
have cured the noncompliance within such period, render void the final plan approval of all uncompleted portions of the planned
development, all prior plan approvals on which such final plan approval depends, and all permits based upon such approvals,
and the village manager shall, without further direction, initiate an appropriate action to revoke the special permit for all portions
of the planned development that have not yet been completed. The manager shall, in addition, take such other action as may be
appropriate to abate the violation.

K. Adjustments To Final Plan During Development:
1. Minor Adjustments: During the development of a planned development, the village manager may authorize minor adjustments to
the final plan when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered during
actual development. Such minor adjustments shall be limited to the following:
(a) Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures by not more than twenty feet (20') or one-fourth (1/4) of the
distance shown on the approved final plan between such structure or structures and any other structure or any vehicular
circulation element or any boundary of the planned development, whichever is less; and
(b) Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than twenty feet (20') or one-fourth (1/4) of the distance shown on
the approved final plan between such circulation element and any structure, whichever is less; and
(c) Altering the location of any open space by not more than fifty feet (50'); and
(d) Altering any final grade by not more than twenty percent (20%) of the originally planned grade; and
(e) Altering the location or type of landscaping elements.
Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of this code and the final plan, as approved, shall be the
minimum necessary to overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if they would result in a violation of any
standard or requirement of this code.
2. Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to the final plan not authorized by subsection K1 of this section shall be considered to be a
major adjustment and shall be granted only upon application to, and approval by, the board of trustees. The board of trustees
may, by ordinance duly adopted, grant approval for a major adjustment without a hearing upon finding that any changes in the
final plan as approved will be in substantial conformity with said final plan. If the board of trustees determines that a major
adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the final plan as approved, then the board of trustees shall refer the request to the
plan commission for further hearing and review as provided in subsection D3 of this section.
L. Amendments To Final Plan Following Completion Of Development: After completion of a planned development, an approved final
plan may be amended, varied, or altered in the same manner and subject to the same limitations, as provided for major
adjustments in subsection K of this section.
M. Lifestyle Housing:
1. General Purposes: The regulations of this subsection M govern development of very high quality townhouse and condominium
dwellings, in one or more buildings, on property near downtown Hinsdale (generally known as "lifestyle housing"). The
regulations are intended to authorize such housing, but only to the extent that it reflects the highest standards of design and
construction, consistent with the village's historic and distinctive residential character and with uses and development adjacent to
the proposed development. Lifestyle housing is intended to be attractive to existing Hinsdale residents who seek housing that
requires less maintenance than single-family detached houses; residents who wish to remain in the village, close to neighbors,
friends, and familiar institutions, near downtown shopping and amenities, and close to the transportation center of the village.
Lifestyle housing may be appropriate on property near downtown Hinsdale and on property of a transitional nature between the
downtown retail environment and nearby single-family residential areas. Lifestyle housing is appropriate in furtherance of the
following public purposes:
(a) Local Atmosphere: To maintain the local, "small town" atmosphere of the areas within which lifestyle housing may be
developed.
(b) Compatibility: To ensure compatibility of new development with the existing characteristics of the area.
(c) Transitional Areas: To protect sensitive areas of transition from one land use to another.
(d) Attractiveness; Stimulation Of Downtown: To protect and enhance the village's attractiveness to longtime residents and to
visitors, and to support and stimulate downtown businesses.
(e) Strong Economy: To strengthen the economy of the village.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 575/605
2. Location Restrictions: Lifestyle housing shall be permitted only in the B-1 community business district, the B-3 general business
district, and the O-2 limited office district. Further, lifestyle housing shall be permitted only on property where the purposes set
forth in subsection M1 of this section are advanced. Further, lifestyle housing shall be permitted on any particular parcel of land
only if the proposed development is, in the determination of the board of trustees, compatible with adjacent land uses. For
example, but only by way of example, a row house style development may be appropriate on a parcel of land located adjacent to
existing residential uses but a condominium development on that same parcel may not be appropriate; or, the board of trustees
may determine under all of the standards applicable to special use permits, site plans, exterior appearance plans, planned
developments, and lifestyle housing that no multiple-family use of any kind is appropriate on that same parcel.
3. Applicability Of District Regulations: The regulations of the zoning district within which the subject property is classified shall
apply to and control development of lifestyle housing except only as specifically provided otherwise in this section.
4. Applicability Of Planned Development Standards: The regulations and standards of this section shall apply in their entirety to
development of lifestyle housing except only as specifically provided otherwise in this subsection M.
5. Special Exterior Appearance And Design Standards: In addition to all other applicable exterior appearance standards, the board
of trustees shall consider and evaluate the propriety of approving a planned development for lifestyle housing guided by the
standards and considerations set forth in subsections 11-605E1(b), E1(c), E2(a), E2(g), E2(h), E2(i), E2(j) and E2(k) of this
article.
6. Special Bulk, Yard, And Space Standards: The bulk, yard, and space standards of the zoning district within which the subject
property is classified shall apply to lifestyle housing except as may be modified pursuant to this section and except as follows:
Maximum height 33 feet or district maximum, whichever is higher, but in no event more than 3
stories
Lot area 20,000 square feet
Minimum lot area per unit 1,000 square feet
Maximum units per acre 35
Minimum lot width 60 feet
Minimum lot depth 125 feet
Maximum lot coverage 70 percent
Maximum building coverage 70 percent
Maximum floor area ratio 1.5
Minimum number of off street parking
spaces
1.5 spaces per unit
7. Authorized Uses: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 4-107D of this code or of subsection H3 of this section, the board
of trustees shall have the authority, in connection with the granting of a planned development approval for lifestyle housing, to
authorize on the first floor of a structure, retail or service uses compatible with similar retail and service uses in the vicinity of the
proposed development. The board of trustees may limit, specifically or generally, the types of retail or service uses that are
authorized and may place any condition on any such uses as the board of trustees determines is appropriate. The board of
trustees shall not authorize any use that is not permitted or authorized as a special use in the B-2 central business district and
shall not authorize any such use above the first floor of any structure.
8. Inapplicability Of Certain Standards: Certain of the standards for planned developments set forth in subsection E of this section
are not useful to the concept of lifestyle housing in the context authorized by this section. Accordingly, although the principles set
forth in said subsection E of this section may be used to guide the board of trustees, the provisions in subsections E2(d), "Public
Open Space And Contributions", E2(e), "Common Open Space", and E2(g), "Building And Spacing", of this section shall not be
strictly applicable to a lifestyle housing proposal.
N. Expansion Of New Or Used Motor Vehicle Dealerships On Ogden Avenue: The board of trustees, in accordance with the
procedures and standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant a special use permit authorizing the
expansion of new or used motor vehicle dealerships located on property abutting Ogden Avenue and existing as of May 1, 2003, as
a planned development. (Ord. 95-14, § 3A, 4-24-1995; Ord. O2002-66, § 4, 10-1-2002; Ord. O2006-75, § 2, 10-17-2006; Ord.
O2007-62, § 4, 9-4-2007)
Sec. 11-604:Site Plan Review:

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=967 576/605
B. Purpose: The site plan review process recognizes that even those uses and developments that have been determined to be
generally suitable for location in a particular district are capable of adversely affecting the purposes for which this code was enacted
unless careful consideration is given to critical design elements. It is the purpose of this section to provide a vehicle for the review
of the developer's attention to such elements.
C. Site Plan Review Required: Site plan review by the board of trustees in accordance with this section shall be required in connection
with the following development:
1.Any development or redevelopment for which this code requires a special use permit, including planned development approval.
2.Any development or redevelopment for which this code requires exterior appearance review or a design review permit.
3.Any development or redevelopment (other than remodeling that does not involve the creation of any new floor space or the
change of any use) of any structure, whether new or existing, other than for one single-family detached dwelling unit involving a
parcel under single ownership or control having an area in excess of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet.
4.Any development or redevelopment involving the creation or expansion of a parking lot or garage.
5.Any development or redevelopment involving a recreational vehicle storage area, a residential recreational facility, or an antenna
or antenna support structure subject to subsection 9-101D7 or D8 of this code.
6.Any nonresidential development on a lot abutting or across a right of way from any residential district.
7.Any development or redevelopment involving a personal wireless services antenna, with or without an antenna support structure.
D. Parties Entitled To Seek Site Plan Approval: Applications for site plan review may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a
contractual interest in, the subject property.
E. Procedure:
1.Application: Applications for site plan approval shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this article.
2.Public Meeting: A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section 11-303
of this article.
3.Notice Requirements For Nonresidential Site Plan Review: Any site plan review required for a nonresidential property that is
within two hundred fifty feet (250') from a single-family zoning district shall be subject to the following notice requirements in
addition to those set forth in section 11-303 of this article for the public meeting required by subsection E2 of this section:
(a)By publication in a newspaper published in the village at least once no less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30)
days in advance of the public meeting date.
(b)By certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery to the owners of residential properties within two hundred fifty
feet (250') of a nonresidential property that is the subject of an application not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty
(30) days in advance of the public meeting.
(c)By posting a sign on the nonresidential property that is the subject of an application. Such sign shall be at least six (6) square
feet in area; shall bear on its face the words "Zoning Application Pending" and a telephone number to be called for additional
information; shall be posted on the nonresidential property, facing the street, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for a
public meeting on the application; and shall be removed from the nonresidential property following, but not before, the
conclusion of the public meeting.

5.Action By Plan Commission: Within sixty (60) days following the conclusion of the public meeting, the plan commission shall
transmit to the board of trustees its recommendation, in the form specified in subsection 11-103H of this article, recommending
either approval or disapproval of the site plan based on the standards set forth in subsection F1 of this section. In the case of any
recommendation for disapproval, suggestions as required by subsection F2 of this section shall be provided. The failure of the
plan commission to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation for approval of the site plan as submitted.
6.Action By Board Of Trustees: Within ninety (90) days following the receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its
failure to act as above provided, the board of trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, shall approve the site plan as submitted, or
shall make modifications acceptable to the applicant and approve such modified site plan, or shall disapprove it in the manner
specified in subsection F of this section either with or without a remand to the plan commission for further consideration. The
failure of the board of trustees to act within ninety (90) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying site plan approval.
F. Standards For Site Plan Approval:
1.Standards: The board of trustees shall not approve, and the plan commission shall not recommend approval of, a site plan
submitted pursuant to this section except on the basis of specific written findings establishing that the applicant has met all of the
following standards:
(a)The application is complete in specified particulars and does not contain or reveal violations of this code or other applicable
regulations that the applicant, after written request, has failed or refused to supply or correct.
(b)If the application is submitted in connection with another application, the approval of which is a condition precedent to the
necessity for site plan review, the applicant has secured approval of that application.
(c)The site plan adequately meets specified standards required by this code with respect to the proposed use or development,
including special use standards where applicable.
(d)The proposed site plan does not interfere with easements or rights of way.
(e)The proposed site plan does not unreasonably destroy, damage, detrimentally modify, or interfere with the enjoyment of
significant natural, topographical, or physical features of the site.

of the proposed site plan do not unreasonably create hazards to safety on or off site or disjointed, inefficient pedestrian or
vehicular circulation paths on or off site.
(h)The screening of the site provides adequate shielding from or for nearby uses.
(i)The proposed structures or landscaping provide reasonable amenity in relation to, or are compatible with, nearby structures
and uses.
(j)In the case of site plans submitted in connection with an application for a special use permit, the proposed site plan makes
adequate provision for the creation or preservation of open space or for its continued maintenance.
(k)The proposed site plan does not create unreasonable drainage or erosion problems or fail to fully and satisfactorily integrate
the site into the overall existing and planned drainage system serving the village.
(l)The proposed site plan does not place unwarranted or unreasonable burdens on specified utility systems serving the site or
area or fail to fully and satisfactorily integrate the site's utilities into the overall existing and planned utility systems serving the
village.

(m)The proposed site plan provides for required public uses designated on the official map.
(n)The proposed site plan does not otherwise adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare.
2.Alternative Approaches: In citing a failure to meet any of the foregoing standards, other than those of subsections F1(a) and
F1(b) of this section, as the basis for recommending disapproval of, or disapproving, a site plan, the plan commission or the
board of trustees shall suggest alternate site plan approaches that could be developed to avoid the specified deficiency or shall
state the reasons why such deficiency cannot be avoided consistent with the applicant's objectives.
G. Effect Of Site Plan Approval: Approval of a site plan shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of
the village including, but not limited to, a certificate of zoning compliance, a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, and
subdivision approval.
A copy of every approved site plan shall be filed with the village manager and the development of the site shall be in substantial
conformity with such approved and filed plan.
H. Limitations On Site Plan Approval: Subject to an extension of time granted by the village manager pursuant to subsection 11-101K
of this article, no site plan approval shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a certificate of
occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that period.
I. Adjustments To Site Plan During Development:
1.Minor Adjustments: During the development of the site, the village manager may authorize minor adjustments to a site plan
approved by the board of trustees when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations
first discovered during actual development. Such minor adjustments shall be limited to the following:
(a)Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures by not more than twenty feet (20') or one-fourth (1/4) of the
distance shown on the approved site plan between such structure or structures and any other structure or any vehicular
circulation element or any boundary of the site plan, whichever is less.
(b)Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than twenty feet (20') or one-fourth (1/4) of the distance shown on
the approved site plan between such circulation element and any structure, whichever is less.
(c)Altering the location of any open space by not more than fifty feet (50').
(d)Altering any final grade by not more than twenty percent (20%) of the originally approved grade.
(e)Altering the location or type of landscaping elements.
Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of this code and the site plan as approved, shall be the
minimum necessary to overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if they would result in a violation of any
standard or requirement of this code.
2.Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to a site plan approved by the board of trustees that is not authorized by subsection I1 of this

board of trustees shall refer the request to the plan commission for further consideration and review as provided in subsection E
of this section.
J. Amendments To Site Plan Following Completion Of Development: After a site is developed in accordance with an approved site
plan, the approved site plan may be amended, varied, or altered in the same manner and subject to the same limitations, as
provided for original approval of site plans. (Ord. 97-4, § 9B, 3-4-1997; Ord. O2009-21, § 2, 4-7-2009; Ord. O2012-51, 11-20-2012)

Sec. 11-605:Design Review Permit:
A. Authority: The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly
adopted, may grant a design review permit for any use or development in the design review overlay district that is permitted in the
base district in which such use or development is located; provided, however, that no such permit shall be granted unless such use
or development complies with the regulations of the base district in which it is located and all necessary certificates, permits, and
approvals for such use or development shall have been secured.
B. Purpose: The design review permit process is intended to provide a procedure for the review of plans for work in the design review
district to ensure that such work will comply with standards established to preserve the integrity of areas and structures which have
been determined to merit special protection.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Design Review Permits: An application for a design review permit may be filed by the owner of, or any
person having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: Applications for design review permits shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 11-301 of this
article.
2. Other Approvals Required Prior To Approval: In any case where the proposed work requires the issuance of a special use
permit, variation, or other approval, no design review permit shall be granted unless and until such special use permit, variation,
or other approval has been issued. The issuance of any such other approval shall not be deemed to establish any right to the
issuance of a design review permit.
3. Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the plan commission in accordance with section 11-303
of this article.
4. Action By Plan Commission: Within thirty five (35) days following the conclusion of the public hearing provided in subsection D3
of this section, the plan commission shall, in writing, recommend to the board of trustees to grant the design review permit
without modification, grant the design review permit with modifications or subject to conditions, or deny the design review permit.
In reaching its recommendation, the plan commission shall be guided by the purposes for which the design review district is
designated and by the particular standards and considerations set forth in subsection E of this section. The failure of the plan
commission to act within thirty five (35) days, or such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be
deemed a recommendation to deny the design review permit.
5. Action By Board Of Trustees: Within thirty five (35) days after receiving the recommendation of the plan commission pursuant to
subsection D4 of this section or, if the plan commission fails to act within thirty five (35) days following the conclusion of the
public hearing provided in subsection D3 of this section, within seventy (70) days following the conclusion of such public hearing,
the board of trustees shall, by ordinance duly adopted, grant the design review permit without modification, grant the design
review permit with modifications or subject to conditions, or deny the design review permit. The failure of the board of trustees to
act within the time limits set in this subsection, or such longer time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed a
denial of the design review permit. In reaching its decision, the board of trustees shall be guided by the purposes for which the
design review district is designated and by the particular standards and considerations set forth in subsection E of this section.
6. Issuance Of Certificate: If a design review permit is granted pursuant to this section, the village manager, within seven (7) days
following the passage of the ordinance by the board of trustees pursuant to subsection D5 of this section, shall issue the design
review permit, noting thereon any modifications or conditions imposed by the board of trustees. Each design review permit shall
state on its face, in bold type, that:

IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO UNDERTAKE ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND APPROVAL WHERE REQUIRED.
E. Standards And Considerations For Design Review Permit: In passing upon applications for design review permits, the plan
commission and the board of trustees shall consider and evaluate the propriety of issuing the design review permit in terms of its
effect on the purposes for which the design review district is designated. In addition, the plan commission and the board of trustees
shall be guided by the following standards and considerations:

shown on plans approved by the issuance of such permit and it shall be unlawful for any person to deviate from such plans without
obtaining an amended permit in the same manner as herein provided for obtaining original permits. (1991 Code)

and surrounding buildings and structures in terms of height, size, proportion, scale, materials, texture, colors, and shapes.
2. Quality Of Design And Construction: The proposed sign will be constructed and maintained with a design and materials of high

hardship or a practical difficulty not caused by an act or omission of the applicant.
(b) Unusual Physical Limitations: The subject property or the structure on which the sign is proposed to be located is burdened
with an unusual physical limitation, such as an irregular shape, unusual geographic location, exceptional topographical feature,
or other extraordinary physical condition, that is peculiar to the subject property and that is more than merely an inconvenience or
cost consideration to the applicant.
(c) Adverse Impacts: The modification, if granted, would have no adverse impact on any abutting or adjacent property and no
adverse impact on the essential character of any part of or all of the neighborhood of the subject property.

impose such conditions and limitations concerning the construction and maintenance of a sign upon the grant of a sign permit as

such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the sign permit.
H. Effect Of Issuance Of A Sign Permit: The granting of a sign permit by the village manager and the plan commission chairperson or
the plan commission, as appropriate, shall not authorize construction or maintenance of any sign, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any other permits or approvals that may be required by the codes and
