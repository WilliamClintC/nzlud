PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of North
Little Rock, Arkansas.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through July 26,
1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is
new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables
appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any
subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within
each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their
location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash
refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this
system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their
proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one
section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would
be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the
end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or
division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that
the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an
abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents
the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon
indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of
the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may
or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX CDA:1
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1
CODE INDEX CDi:1

Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several
headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the
publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be
properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders
of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete
pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As
revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be
inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos,
Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members
of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Randy Morley, City Attorney, and Ms. Mary L. Munns, City Clerk, for
their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts
and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city
readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's
affairs.

(c)
Except as otherwise provided, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding $500.00, or double such sum for each repetition thereof. If the violation is, in its nature, continuous in
respect to time, the penalty for allowing the continuance thereof is a fine not to exceed $250.00 for each day that

State law reference Ordinance violations, A.C.A. §§ 14-55-501 et seq., 14-55-601 et seq.
Sec. 1-9. - Issuance of citation or notice of offense, who may issue; failure to appear on citation declared a

The police department, community planning department, code enforcement officers, health officers, and animal
control workers, or persons employed by such departments, are authorized, for the violation of any ordinance or
city code provision for which they have enforcement responsibility, to give to an offender either a citation to
appear in municipal court, or a notice of offense.
(b)
Citations for code violations shall be used in all instances wherein the violator is physically present, and failure
to appear in court or pay the fine and costs prior to the court date set pursuant thereto shall constitute a
misdemeanor; the violator shall be requested to sign the citation, but refusal to sign shall not relieve the violator
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
11/543
of the obligation to appear in court as specified on the citation, and the issuing officer or employee shall note
upon the citation the violator's refusal to sign.
(c)
A notice of offense shall be used in all instances wherein the violator is not physically present to receive a
citation, and may be served by either mailing a copy thereof to the violator by any form of mail, or by posting a
copy thereof upon the property of the violator which forms a basis for the violation. The notice of offense shall
inform the owner of the property in violation that he must appear at the city office or department designated on
the notice to pay a stated sum representing a civil penalty equivalent to the established minimum fine but
without imposition of court costs, or alternatively to accept service of a citation to appear in court for trial,
subject to both fine and court costs; the notice shall also state the consequence of failure to do so. Upon failure
to either pay the civil penalty or to accept service of a citation, as instructed on such notice of violation, the code
enforcement officer shall swear out a complaint with the city attorney for the purpose of obtaining an arrest
warrant or summons for the violation, and usual procedures shall thereafter govern the arrest and trial of the
person so served.
(d)
Both the citation and the notice of offense shall state the name and address of the violator and the date of
violation, shall contain a statement of the nature of the violation and shall be signed by the officer or city
employee having knowledge of such violation; in addition, the citation shall have a signature line for the violator
to promise to appear in court, and the notice of violation shall contain the cautionary language previously
prescribed in this section.
(e)

parking ticket or uniform traffic ticket by police personnel.
(Code 1980, § 1-9)
Sec. 1-10. - Severability of parts of Code.
The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause,
sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of
a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses,
sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code.

State Law reference Public Facilities Boards Act, A.C.A. § 14-137-101 et seq.
Sec. 2-656. - Findings.
The city council hereby finds and determines:
(1)
There exists within and near the city a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities
available for rehabilitation, construction or purchase on terms that persons and families of low and moderate
income can afford to pay.
(2)
Existing economic conditions, including high rates of interest on residential mortgage loans and a shortage of
funds within lending institutions in the state for residential mortgage loans, are operating to:
a.
Further restrict the rehabilitation, construction and purchase of residential housing by persons of low and
moderate income at reasonable affordable costs;
b.
Create unemployment and hardship within the residential construction industry, adversely affecting residents of
the city; and
c.
Reduce and limit the value of property within the city;
all of which adversely affect the city's tax revenues and which, if not alleviated, will lead to further urban blight
and decay and result in disproportionately large expenditures for services by the city.
(3)
The availability of mortgage financing to assist such persons and families in the rehabilitation, construction or
purchase of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities will be aided by the providing of funds for
mortgage financing of residential housing facilities by the creation of a public facilities board pursuant to the
provisions of the Public Facilities Boards Act (A.C.A. § 14-137-101 et seq.).
(4)
The providing of financial assistance in order to enable persons and families of low and moderate income to
finance the costs of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities is a proper public purpose as declared
by the Public Facilities Boards Act (A.C.A. § 14-137-101 et seq.) and this determination of the city council.
(5)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances

The public purpose of financing residential housing facilities may best be served by establishing a public
facilities board to purchase mortgages on such residential housing facilities or make loans to mortgage lenders to
provide financing for residential housing facilities as provided in the Public Facilities Boards Act (A.C.A. § 14-
137-101 et seq.).

parking facilities, recreational and tourist facilities, waterworks facilities, sewer facilities, facilities for securing
or developing industry, or any combination of such facilities, or any interest in such facilities, including, without
limitation, leasehold interest in and mortgages or such facilities. Additionally, such board shall have all the
powers as enumerated in A.C.A. § 14-137-106.
(b)
In effecting the purposes of this division to provide decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities within
or near the city, the residential housing facilities board shall require that the funds made available for the
purchase of mortgages or making loans to mortgage lenders shall be used for residential housing facilities
(including multifamily housing facilities), and that the facilities shall be located within the five-mile planning
jurisdiction of the city as now existing or as may hereafter be extended.
(c)
In addition, the residential housing facilities board shall have each of the powers set forth in A.C.A. § 14-137-
111, as amended, and appropriate to the purposes for which the board is created. The board may enter into such

Has exhibited fierce or vicious behavior toward a person;
(2)
Has attacked a person or another animal with such severity as to cause physical injury or property damage; or
(3)
Is the offspring of a domestic dog and an innately wild animal. The behavior of a dog should not be considered
vicious if the dog was provoked or teased. When rendering a determination pursuant to this section, any canine
that reasonably resembles an innately wild animal shall be presumed to be the offspring of a domestic dog and
an innately wild animal; however, this presumption may be defeated by a preponderance of evidence to the
contrary. When used in this section, the term "offspring" includes animals that are separated by less than three
reproductive generations from an innately wild animal.
(b)
Initial determination. An animal control officer shall deem a canine to be a vicious dog if the animal control
officer determines that the canine satisfies the definition of a vicious dog as described in subsection (a). Upon
deeming the canine to be a vicious dog, the animal control officer shall notify the owner by hand delivery or by
mailing a notice by certified mail to the owner. The officer shall also apprehend the canine and shall not release
it until the requirements of subsection (d) have been met or until so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(c)
Appeal of determination. Any person who has received notice that his or her canine has been deemed a vicious
dog may appeal such decision to the Director of the North Little Rock Animal Control Department. The appeal
must be made within ten days of the day the notice was made in accordance with subsection (b). Upon receiving
an appeal, the director shall schedule and hold a hearing within ten days to determine whether the initial
determination was rendered in error. The director's decision shall be considered the final decision of the city as
to whether the canine is a vicious dog. If the initial determination is not appealed or if the right to appeal is
waived, the initial determination shall be considered the final decision of the city as to whether the canine is a
vicious dog. An appeal from the decision of the director may only be made to a court of competent jurisdiction.
(d)
Release. A canine that has been apprehended pursuant to subsection (a) shall only be released by the animal
shelter if all of the following conditions have been met:
(1)
The owner has signed a written agreement that unless and until the canine is determined to no longer be a
vicious dog by the animal control department or a court of competent jurisdiction, the canine shall be controlled
in a manner consistent with this section when it is within the municipal limits of North Little Rock; and
(2)
The canine has been permanently identified by the animal control department by a unique identifying mark as a
vicious dog or the owner has signed a written agreement to have such mark affixed to the canine within 20 days
or until all appeals have expired.
The animal control department shall establish and maintain standardized forms to implement the requirements of
this subsection. No vicious dog in the possession of the animal control department shall be released to any
person other than the owner.

of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along
the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an
additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
(4)
Transitional zones: Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the sides of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 694 feet above mean sea
level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot
upward, beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they
intersect the conical surface.

this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure or alteration
which was begun prior to the effective date of this article and is diligently prosecuted.
(b)
Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon

operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and
lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the city.
(c)
Lowering or removal of nonconforming uses. In order to eliminate or mitigate existing hazards to landing and
taking-off at the airport, to improve and make safer the airport, and to permit public use of any obstructed
navigable airspace needed for such use, the municipal airport commission may acquire, by purchase, grant or
condemnation, such estate or interest in any structure or tree of nonconforming use for which a permit has been
granted in accordance with section 14-57(c) as is necessary to conform to the applicable height limitation
prescribed in this article. In cases of imminent danger to the health, safety and general welfare of the public, the
municipal airport commission shall take such immediate steps as are necessary to remove such danger, and a
hearing shall thereafter be held to determine what compensation, if any, should be made to the owner of the

nonconforming uses, A.C.A. § 14-363-206.
Sec. 14-57. - Permits.
(a)
Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this subsection (a), no material change
shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the
director of community planning. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity for it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would
conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall
be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance
has been approved in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.
(1)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any
tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
zones.
(2)
In areas lying within the limits of the approach zone, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from
each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such
approach zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits established
by this article except as set forth in section 14-54(6).
(b)
Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction, or
that would allow a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
89/543
on September 27, 1993 or on the effective date of any amendments to this article or than it is when the
application for such a permit for existing uses shall be granted.
(c)
Continuance of nonconforming uses. The owner of any structure or tree which is nonconforming to the
regulations of this article on September 27, 1993 shall be granted a permit authorizing continuance of such
nonconforming use, upon application therefor made by him; provided that, if such application is not made within
90 days of such date, the department of community planning shall by appropriate action compel the owner of the
nonconforming structure or tree, at his own expense, to lower or remove such object to the extent necessary to
conform to this article.
(d)
Change and repair of nonconforming uses. Before any existing nonconforming structure or tree for which a
permit has been issued in accordance with subsection (c) of this section may be altered or repaired, rebuilt,
allowed to grow higher or replanted, a permit must be secured from the municipal planning commission
authorizing such change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would permit the structure or tree in
question to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the permit for its
continuance was granted.
(e)
Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the director of community planning determines that a
nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 50 percent torn down, physically deteriorated
or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. In all such cases of 50 percent destruction, deterioration
or decay, whether application is made for a permit for repair or not, the director of community planning shall, by
appropriate action, compel the owner of the nonconforming tree or structure, at his own expense, to lower or
remove such object to the extent necessary to conform to the applicable height limit.
(f)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree,
or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of
adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is
duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and the
relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for
variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the airport manager and/or municipal airport commission for advice as to the
aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager and/or municipal airport commission does not
respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or
deny such application.
(g)
Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate or maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings
and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to
require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings
and lights.

prescribed by law for publication of legal notices, of a public hearing upon the application in question; a public

(Ord. No. 7001, § 6, 8-26-96)
Sec. 38-62. - Control by board of directors.
The contractor is authorized to operate the city ambulance service system under the supervision and control of
the contractor's board of directors. Contractor shall allow the mayor to appoint two representatives to the board
to represent the city on the board.
(Ord. No. 7001, § 7, 8-26-96)
Sec. 38-63. - Standards of production and performance.
The contractor shall follow the following as minimum standards:
(1)
Equipment and management capability. Each and every ambulance and all on-board equipment utilized by the
contractor in performing services which are the subject of this article shall comply with applicable standards
required for licensure. The provider shall maintain the equipment and shall employ sufficient backup equipment
to ensure that a safe level of reserve equipment capacity is available to provide peak period ambulance coverage
even at times when unusual occurrences of equipment breakdown and routine equipment maintenance coincide.
(2)
Personnel. The contractor shall ensure:
a.
That two (2) persons certified under state law are on board each ambulance on ALS (code 1 or 2) ambulance
runs or available for dispatch, at least one (1) of which is certified as a paramedic, and the other of which is
certified as a paramedic or emergency medical technician (EMT).
b.
If only one (1) person on board is a certified paramedic, that person shall not function as the driver while the
patient is on board. Every BLS ambulance subject to regulation under this article is required to have on board
two (2) EMT's, one to drive and the other to attend. The contractor shall establish and maintain sufficient
management capability to ensure that equipment and personnel utilized are managed in an efficient and effective
manner to produce the desired clinical performance and response time performance on a routine basis.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
166/543
(3)
Clinical performance. The clinical performance of the contractor and its personnel shall be consistent with and
shall confirm to the operating procedures and medical protocols adopted by the AEPF, Inc. Where clinical
performance deficiencies are discovered, the contractor shall demonstrate an aggressive and effective effort to
correct the deficiencies in a timely manner.
(4)
Response time performance. Response time performance standards are as follows:
a.
Code 1 calls. (life threatening emergencies)
1.
The fire department shall furnish a diligent good faith effort to manage all available resources to achieve a fourminute
maximum response time for a trained first responder to a code 1.
2.
The contractor shall furnish a diligent good faith effort to maintain an eight-minute (8:59) maximum response
time for an advanced life support paramedic ambulance. The contractor shall employ enough personnel, acquire
enough equipment and manage its resources in the manner necessary to meet the eight-minute response time
standard on not less than 90 percent of all presumptively designated code 1 calls originating each month from
within the city limits.
3.
Where an ambulance unit is dispatched from a nontransporting first-response-only status its response time may
be counted as the contractor ambulance response time even though the patient was transported by a different
ambulance. In addition, the response time of a neighboring ambulance service responding by mutual aid request
may also be counted as the contractor's ambulance response time, provided the level of life support capability
furnished by the neighboring ambulance service is comparable to that required under this article, as determined
by the AEPF, Inc., and provided that reliance upon neighboring ambulance service operators is only an
occasional event and not a routine method of operation of the contractor.
b.
Code 2 calls (non-life threatening emergencies. The contractor shall establish a 12-minute (12.59) advanced life
support paramedic ambulance response time standard for code 2 calls on not less than 90 percent of all
presumptively designated code 2 calls originating each month from within the city limits.
c.
Other run codes (non-life threatening). The contractor's response to other run codes shall be reasonable, but in
every case where a conflicting demand for resources occurs, response to code 1 and code 2 calls shall take
precedence over requests for service requests. Furthermore, the contractor shall display sound judgment in
developing its system status management plans to preserve a safe level of emergency response capability at all
times by delaying response to requests for non-emergency service until additional ambulance units become
available whenever the number of remaining ambulance units available for dispatch falls below a reasonably
established safe level of emergency reserve capacity, as determined by historical demand analyses.
d.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
167/543
Retrospective designation. For purposes of this subsection, the designation of a run as code 1, code 2, or other
shall be made by the contractor's system status management personnel at the point of dispatch on a presumptive
basis and no retrospective alteration of such designation shall be allowed. However, runs originally designated
as code 2, or other may be retrospectively redesignated upward by the executive director, if the executive
director disputes the original designation, and the contractor's board requests a determination from the AEPF
who then reviews and determines that the original designation was improper, given the information available to
the EMS control center personnel at the time of the presumptive designation of the run code type.
e.
Exempt calls. Certain types of calls may be excluded as specified by the medical director and the executive
director on a standard form signed by both. Such records are maintained in the office of the operations manager.
f.
Community response time. In addition to the response time performance standard required under this section for
run code 1 and run code 2 calls, the contractor shall furnish and manage its resources in the manner necessary to
provide reliable emergency and nonemergency ambulance service throughout the entire city and shall perform
its system status management and system status planning operations so as to minimize the differences in the
respective average emergency-response-time performances among the various ambulance districts of the city to
the greatest practical extent. In addition, the contractor shall take such steps as necessary to reduce or eliminate
any continuing pattern of apparent discrimination in the average response time performance to any given
ambulance district or portion thereof.
(5)
Continuous physician medical control required. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that its field
personnel at all times have access to qualified medical control and direction concerning the care of patients in
the field by a base station physician or nurse. All medical control and direction shall be available by reliable
radio communications, according to the communications standards and applicable standards of medical control.
(6)
Refusal to render emergency care prohibited. It is a violation of this article to fail to respond to a call to provide
emergency ambulance service, to render first-aid treatment as is necessary, or to otherwise refuse to provide any
emergency ambulance services within the scope of the ambulance operations, provided that these services are
not required if the patient refuses to consent to treatment.
(Ord. No. 7001, § 8, 8-26-96; Ord. No. 7788, §§ 2, 3, 2-27-06)
Sec. 38-64. - Vehicle permits.
It shall be unlawful for any person subject to regulation by this article to operate an ambulance or helicopter
service unless a currently valid state vehicle permit has been issued.
(Ord. No. 7001, § 9, 8-26-96)
Sec. 38-65. - Patient management and management of scene.
Authority for patient management in a medical emergency shall be invested in the senior paramedic designated
by the contractor. Authority for the management of the scene of a medical emergency shall be vested in the
senior paramedic until appropriate public safety officials arrive on the scene and take control. The scene of a
medical emergency shall be managed in a manner described to minimize the risk of death or health impairment
to the patient and to other persons who may be exposed to the risks as a result of the emergency condition, and
priorities shall be placed upon the interests of those persons exposed to the more serious risks to life and health.
Public safety officials shall ordinarily consult the senior paramedic in charge at the scene in the determination of
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
168/543
relevant risk factors. In the event a licensed physician appears on the scene and desires to assume direction and
control of patient care, the licensed physician may do so if the base station physician releases the paramedic
from responsibility for directing patient care and the physician who is on scene continues care in the ambulance
to the hospital.

flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard
boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the

V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground
level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water, and (ii)
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the
magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, "elevated
building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of elevated building, even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of
the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.
Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that

Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized,
appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce
the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of
associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes.
These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.
Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source
(see definition of flooding).
Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than a designated height.

the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of section 60.3 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.
For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers,
and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the
term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood
insurance rate map are referenced.
New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community.
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier
Resources Act (PL 97-348)) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally
aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is
started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose
of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
187/543
comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
a state inventory of historic places.
Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement
would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner
otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations.)
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4)
or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as
that documentation is provided.
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929
(or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal
or riverine areas.
(Code 1980, § 11-19)
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 50-37. - Findings of fact.
The city council hereby finds and determines that:
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in
flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from
flood damage.
(Code 1980, § 11-16)
Sec. 50-38. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
188/543
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a
manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Code 1980, § 11-17)
Sec. 50-39. - Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive
increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved
in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.

December, 1986, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and
FBFM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article.
(Code 1980, § 11-21)
Sec. 50-43. - Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this article and another regulation conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
(Code 1980, § 11-24)
Sec. 50-44. - Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be:
(1)
Considered as minimum requirements;
(2)
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(3)
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(Code 1980, § 11-25)
Sec. 50-45. - Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and
flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the
areas of special flood hazards, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 50-101. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements:
(1)
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
(2)
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize
flood damage;
(3)
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
(4)
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances

prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
(5)
All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the system;
(6)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
(7)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding.
(Code 1980, § 11-31)
Sec. 50-102. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 50-
41, section 50-72(8) or section 50-103(c), the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard
of this subsection as proposed in section 50-74(a)(1) is satisfied.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or
other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the
base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood
level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the
specific elevation in relation to mean sea level to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by
the floodplain administrator.
(3)
Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a.
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
196/543
b.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
c.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(4)
Manufactured homes.
a.
Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A shall be installed using methods and practices
which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and
anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and
local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
b.
All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subsection (1).
c.
Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on
the community's FIRM be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is at or above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
(Code 1980, § 11-32)
Sec. 50-103. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
(a)
All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with
sections 50-37, 50-38 and 50-39 of this article.
(b)
All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall
meet development permit requirements of section 50-73; section 50-74; and the provisions of this division.
(c)
Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development,
including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is
lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 50-42 or section 50-72(8) of this article.
(d)
All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
(Code 1980, § 11-33)
Sec. 50-104. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-42 are areas designated as shallow
flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in
feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(3)
A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the
standards of this section, as proposed in section 50-74(a)(1), are satisfied.
(4)
Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters
around and away from proposed structures.
(Code 1980, § 11-34)
Sec. 50-105. - Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-42 are areas designated as floodways.
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
198/543
Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, unless certification by a professional registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating
that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of
the base flood discharge.
(2)
If subsection (1), above, is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

DIVISION 2. - JUVENILE CURFEW
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
213/543
Sec. 66-96. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Juvenile or minor means any person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing often employed in this
division, any person 17 years of age or less.
Parent means any person having custody of a juvenile:
(1)
As a natural or adoptive parent;
(2)
As a legal guardian;
(3)
As a person who stands in loco parentis;
(4)
As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Remain means to stay behind, to tarry, and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of
groups (or of interacting minors) totalling three or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be
using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement this
definition with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this division
so that this is not a mere prohibition of presence of juveniles. More and more exceptions become available with
increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulations.
Street means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of
vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal
right-of-way, including but not limited to traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and
any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term "street" applies
irrespective of what it is called or formerly named, whether alley, avenue, court, road, or otherwise. The term
"street" shall also include shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, public buildings, the common
areas of public housing developments, and similar areas that are open to the use of the public.
Time of night is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight
Savings Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time then observed in the
city police station.
Years of age continues from one birthday, such as the 17th, to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the
18th birthday, making it clear that 17 or less years of age be treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years
of age."
(Code 1980, § 21-122)
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 66-97. - Finding and purpose.
(a)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
214/543
The city council hereby finds there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by
certain parents and guidance for juveniles under 18 years of age, resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide
range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism, noisy and rowdy behavior, breaking and entering, public
drinking and littering, harassment of residents, and more serious violent crimes including battery and murder.
(b)
The city council further finds that the offensive activities of juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws
and ordinances because the activities are concealed whenever police officers are present, and that the
establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and
unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act
reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles.
(c)
The city council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew
ordinances in other communities have been a factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency. A curfew in this city is
particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community and the sense of the community
that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles. This attitude of the community is
reflected in the curfew hours declared by this division, which takes into consideration the danger hours for
nocturnal crime.
(d)
North Little Rock is basically a family community. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the
accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have
had demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years. The city council has determined that as
parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases and that there is a need for
nocturnal curfew for juveniles in the city and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will
reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in their care and
custody.
(Code 1980, § 21-121)
Sec. 66-98. - Curfew hours established.
It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be or remain in or upon the streets within
the city at night during the period ending at 5:00 a.m. and beginning:
(1)
At 12:00 midnight on Friday and Saturday nights; and
(2)
At 10:00 p.m. on all other nights.
(Code 1980, § 21-123)
Sec. 66-99. - Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases a minor on a city street during the nocturnal hours prescribed for minors shall
not, however, be considered in violation of this division:
(1)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
215/543
When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
(2)
When accompanied by an adult at least 21 years of age who is not the parent and who is authorized by a parent
of such minor to take such parent's place in accompanying such minor for a designated period of time and
purpose within a specified area.
(3)
When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise
of religion, freedom of speech, and the right of such exercise, by first delivering to the person designated by the
chief of police to receive such information, at the police department on Pershing Boulevard, a written
communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned by a parent of the juvenile, with their home address
and telephone number, specifying when, where, and in what manner the juvenile will be on the streets at night
(during hours when this division is otherwise applicable to such minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment
right.
(4)
In case of reasonable necessity for a juvenile remaining on the streets, but only after the juvenile's parent has
communicated to the person designated by the chief of police to receive such notifications the facts establishing
the reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose, including
points of origin and destination. A copy of the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by
the chief of police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and
addresses of the parent and juvenile, shall be admissible evidence.
(5)
When returning home from and within one hour after the termination of a school or city sponsored activity, or an
activity of a religious or other voluntary association, of which prior notice indicating the place and probable time
of termination has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the person designated by
the chief of police on duty at the police station, thus encouraging, as in other exceptional situations, responsible
conduct on the part of juveniles involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any conflicting
interests.
(6)
When engaging in the duties of bona fide employment or traveling directly, without undue delay or detour, from
home to the place of employment, or from the place of employment to the home.
(7)
When the minor is in a motor vehicle for the purpose of interstate travel, either through, beginning or ending in
the city.
(Code 1980, § 21-124)
Sec. 66-100. - Parental responsibility; police procedures.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for a parent of a juvenile to permit or allow the juvenile to be or remain upon any city street
under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this division. This
division is intended to hold neglectful or careless parents to a reasonable community standard of parental
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
216/543
responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile.
(b)
Police procedures shall be refined in light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a
parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances.
(c)
When a parent or guardian has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been
recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to
take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released in accordance with state and federal law.
(d)
In the case of a first violation of this division by a juvenile, the police department shall, by certified mail or
direct service, send and/or deliver to a parent written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent
violation will result in full enforcement of this division, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of
applicable penalties.
(Code 1980, § 21-125)
Sec. 66-101. - Enforcement procedure.
(a)
If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is on the streets in violation of this division, the officer
shall notify the juvenile that he is in violation of this division and shall require the juvenile to provide his name,
address and telephone number and how to contact his parent or guardian.
(b)
In determining the age of the juvenile believed to be in violation of this division, and in the absence of
convincing evidence, a police officer shall use his best judgment in determining age.
(Code 1980, § 21-126)
Sec. 66-102. - Penalties for division violations.
(a)
If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 66-100(d) of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates
section 66-101 (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be treated as an offense by the
parent.
(b)
Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of this division more than three times shall be reported by
the chief of police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision, and the chief of police shall
refer the matter to the county prosecuting attorney and/or the state department of human services and/or other
appropriate authorities.

The public works director shall approve prior to the start of any street cut, the type, design, manner of cut repair,
barricading of the cut and cut repair and shall also require the following, but not limited to the following:
(1)
At least one two-sided sign that bears the name of the utility company responsible for the cut shall be kept at
each cut location. This shall apply for not only maintenance cuts that require permits, but also any other cuts
related to relocations, new installations, etc. of the utility company. The sign shall also bear the telephone
number of the party within the utility company that shall be responsible for managing the maintenance and
making of the cut. The sign shall also be legible for at least 100 feet and shall be at least three feet by three feet
in size. The sign shall be placed in a conspicuous spot that is easily visible from either direction of traffic. The
sign or signs shall be posted at the time a cut is made and shall remain in place until the permanent cut repair is
complete. During the time that the sign or signs are required to be in place, it shall be the responsibility of the
utility company to maintain the sign. It will be acceptable to allow the signs on the rolling equipment of the
utility company to serve as temporary signage while they are at the cut site, however, they must be legible at 100
feet, have the required utility telephone number, and be replaced by proper signage when the rolling equipment
is not at the site. This signage is required for all cuts, whether they are in the pavement or behind the curb, as
long as the cut is in the city right-of-way or city easement.
(2)
Contact persons and phone numbers shall be a part of any permit request. As many as three names (or titles) and
numbers can be listed and at least one of them shall be reachable during normal working hours. If one of these

fails shall be in violation of this article.

be routine.

(1)
If any taxpayer fails to file any return as required hereunder, the commission, from any information in its
possession or obtainable by it, may determine the correct amount of tax for the taxable period. If a return has

When no return has been filed and the commission determines that there is an A&P tax due for the taxable
period or when a return has been filed and the commission determines that the A&P tax disclosed by the return
is less than the tax disclosed by its examination, the commission shall propose the assessment of additional tax
plus penalties, as the case may be, and shall give notice of the proposed assessment to the taxpayer. The notice
shall explain the basis for the proposed assessment and shall state that a final assessment, as provided for herein,
will be made if the taxpayer does not protest such proposed assessment as provided hereby. The taxpayer does

circuit court, where the matter shall be tried de novo.
(c)

(Ord. No. 7394, § 20, 9-10-01)
Sec. 98-60. - Issuance of certificates of indebtedness and execution.
(a)
(1)
a.
If a taxpayer does not timely and properly pursue his remedies seeking relief from a decision of the commission
or hearing officer and a final assessment is made against the taxpayer, or if the taxpayer fails to pay the
deficiency assessed upon notice and demand, then the commission through its authorized representative shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, issue to the circuit clerk of any county of the state in which the taxpayer's business
is located a certificate of indebtedness certifying that the person named therein is indebted to the commission for
the amount of the tax established by the commission as due.
b.
If a taxpayer has a delinquent A&P tax liability to the commission of less than $1,000.00, the commission or its
hearing officer may enter into an agreement with the taxpayer to allow the taxpayer to pay the delinquency in
installments. The commission or its hearing officer may choose not to issue a certificate of indebtedness during
the period of the installment agreement if he determines that it is in the best interest of the commission.
(2)
The circuit clerk shall enter immediately upon the circuit court judgment docket:
a.
The name of the delinquent taxpayer;
b.
The amount certified as being due;
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
305/543
c.
The name of the tax; and
d.
The date of entry upon the judgment docket.
(3)
a.
The entry of the certificate of indebtedness shall have the same force and effect as the entry of a judgment
rendered by the circuit court. This entry shall constitute the commission's lien upon the title of any real and
personal property of the taxpayer in the county where the certificate of indebtedness is recorded.
b.
This lien is in addition to any other lien existing in favor of the commission to secure payment of taxes,
applicable interest, penalties, and costs. The lien is superior to other liens of any type or character attaching to
the property after the date of entry of the certificate of indebtedness on the judgment docket. This lien is superior
to all claims of unsecured creditors.
c.
The certificate of indebtedness authorized by this subsection shall continue in force for ten years from the date
of recording and shall automatically expire after the ten-year period has run. Actions on the lien on the
certificate of indebtedness shall be commenced within ten years after the date of recording of the certificate, and
not afterward.
(b)
(1)
After entry of the certificate, the circuit clerk shall issue a writ of execution directed to the commission,
authorizing the commission to levy upon and against all real and personal property of the taxpayer.

taken for the recovery of a judgment at law.

executions rendered by the circuit courts of this state, except the commission shall act in the place of the county
sheriffs.
(4)
The commission shall have this authority for all liens either presently filed or filed after the passage of the
ordinance from which this division derives.
(c)
(1)
Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the commission from resorting to any other means provided by law for
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
306/543
collecting delinquent taxes.
(2)
The issuance of a certificate of indebtedness, entry by the clerk, and levy of execution as provided in this section
shall not constitute an election of remedies with respect to the collection of the tax.
(3)
The taxes, fees, interest, and penalties imposed or levied hereby may be collected in the same way as a personal
debt of the taxpayer.
(4)
The commission may sue to the same effect and extent as for the enforcement of a right of action for debt.
(5)
All provisional remedies available in these actions are available to the commission in the enforcement of the
payment of the A&P tax.
(d)
(1)
In addition to the remedies provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the commission may direct the
circuit clerk to issue a writ of execution directed to the sheriff of any county authorizing the sheriff to levy upon
and against all real and personal property of the taxpayer. The writ shall be issued, served, and executed in the
same manner as provided for in the issuance and service of executions rendered by the circuit courts of this state.
(2)
The circuit clerks and sheriffs shall be entitled to receive the same fees provided by law in these matters. These
fees shall be collected from the taxpayer by either the commission or the sheriff in addition to the tax, penalties,
and interest included in the certificate of indebtedness. If the sheriff is unable, after diligent effort, to collect the
tax, interest, penalties, and costs, the commission may pay such fees as are properly shown to be due to the clerk
and sheriff.
(e)
The commission may contract with persons inside or outside the state to help the commission collect
delinquencies of resident or nonresident taxpayers.
(Ord. No. 7394, § 21, 9-10-01)
Sec. 98-61. - Injunction proceedings.
When a return required hereunder has not been filed or does not furnish all the information required by the
commission or when the A&P taxes imposed by law have not been paid or when any required license or permit
has not been secured, the commission may institute any necessary action or proceeding in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the county to enjoin the person or taxpayer from continuing operations until the report or return
has been filed, required licenses or permits secured, or taxes paid as required. The injunction shall be issued
without a bond being required from the commission.

307/543
(a)
The commission may enter into an agreement to compound, settle, or compromise any controversy relating to
the A&P tax when:
(1)
The controversy is over the amount of tax due;
(2)
The inability to pay results from the insolvency of the taxpayer.
(b)
The commission may waive or remit the interest or penalty, or any portion thereof, ordinarily accruing because
of a taxpayer's failure to pay the A&P tax within the statutory period allowed for its payment:
(1)
If the taxpayer's failure to pay the tax is satisfactorily explained to the commission; or
(2)
If the failure results from a mistake by the taxpayer of either the law or the facts subjecting him to such tax; or
(3)
If the inability to pay the interest or penalty results from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the taxpayer.
(c)
In settling or compromising any controversy relating to the liability of a person for the A&P tax for any taxable
period, the commission is authorized to enter into a written closing agreement concerning the liability. When the
closing agreement is signed by the commission, it shall be final and conclusive, and except upon a showing of
fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, no additional assessment or collection shall be made by the
commission, and the taxpayer shall not institute any judicial proceeding to recover such liabilities as agreed to in
the closing agreement.
(d)
The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations establishing guidelines for determining whether a
proposed offer of compromise is adequate and is acceptable to resolve a tax dispute.
(Ord. No. 7394, § 23, 9-10-01)
Sec. 98-63. - Release of property from lien.

assessment, order, judgment, or certificate of indebtedness obtained by or from any levy made by it if:

Either full payment is made to the commission of the sum it considers adequate consideration for the release; or
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
308/543
(2)
Adequate security deposit is made with the commission to secure the payment of the debt evidenced by the lien.
(b)
When the commission determines that its assessment, certificate of indebtedness, or judgment is clouding the
title of property because of an error in the description of properties or similarity in names, the commission may
issue a release without the payment of any consideration.
(c)
The commission's release shall be given under its seal and filed in the office of the circuit clerk in the county in
which the lien is filed, or it shall be recorded in any office in which conveyances of real estate may be recorded.
(Ord. No. 7394, § 24, 9-10-01)
Sec. 98-64. - Violations.

shall be guilty of a violation which shall be punishable up to a $500.00 fine. Each day a person transacts
business within the city without a valid A&P permit shall constitute a separate violation.
(Ord. No. 7394, § 25, 9-10-01)
Sec. 98-65. - Criminal penalties.
Sanctions for any taxpayer who willfully attempts to evade or defeat the payment of the A&P tax, or who assists
any taxpayer to evade or defeat the payment, or otherwise fails to file a report, fails to pay the tax, or makes a
false or fraudulent report, return, statement, claim, application or other instrument required by the commission in
connection with the A&P tax, or makes a false answer to any question from the commission or its designed

Sec. 106-2. - Wastewater utility treatment works rates.
(a)
(1)
That the city hereby establishes rates to be charged for services furnished by the system, which the city council
finds and declares to be fair, reasonable and necessary to be charged to all users who contribute wastewater to
the system. The proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of operating and maintaining
the system, including replacement ("OM & R"). (Replacement is defined as expenditures for obtaining and
installing equipment, accessories or appurtenances during the useful life of the system necessary to maintain the
capacity and performance for which they were designed and constructed.)
(2)
All users of the System shall be charged the following monthly rates per 100 CF or portions thereof of metered
water consuruption with the following minimum charge for 400 CF. All sewer users shall be classified by the
city council as residential, commercial, or industrial:
Inside City Limits Outside City Limits
Per 100 CF 400 CF min. Per 100 CF 400 CF min.
$1.69 $ 6.67 $ 2.53 $ 10.12
The above rates include a charge of $0.53 per 100 CF or a portion thereof of metered water consumption for
debt service with a $2.12 minimum charge for 400 CF for debt service. The remainder of the rates are allocated
to OM & R. User charge methodology for OM & R is as follows:
Total annual OM&R (cost in $/100 CF) = Total annual OM &amp / R;Number of 100 CF sold annually
(3)
In the case of significant industrial customers (defined as any nonresidential customer which normally
discharges wastewater to the system in quantities of 25,000 gallons per day or greater or whose wastewater
contains, or has the potential to contain, toxic pollutants, restricted pollutants, or noncompatible pollutants),
when the wastewater characteristics exceed certain parameters, the following penalties shall apply (which
penalties may be in addition to any other penalties permitted by law):
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
336/543
Biochemical oxygen demand ("BOD"), per pound of BODs discharged for waste strength concentrations greater
than 250 mg/1, i.e. (BODS 250) × (0.00624) × (CCF) .....$0.86
Total suspended solids ("TSS"), per pound of TSS discharged for waste strength concentrations greater than 250
mg/l, i.e. (TSS 250) × (0.00624) × (CCF) .....0.12
pH, per CCF for all discharges for which the pH is greater than 11 or less than 5, i.e. (CCF) × ($1.23) .....1.23
Fats, oils, and greases ("FOG"), per pound of fats, oils and greases for wastewater discharges exceeding 100
mg/l of fats, oils and greases, i.e. (FOG 100) × (0.00624) × (CCF) .....0.31
Other limited parameters. The following parameters are limited in concentration by the sewer committee through
regulation:
Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Cyanide, Lead, Mercury, Nickel, Silver, Zinc, Arsenic, Selenium, Boron,
Molybdenum.
A charge of $0.12 per CCF per parameter shall be made for all wastewater exceeding the local discharge limits
set by the sewer committee as authorized by ordinance, i.e. (CCF) × (0.12).
The above charges shall be based on sample test results by the utility. A spilt of any sample used for the purpose
of establishing charges shall be made available to the user upon prior written request.
The payment of the above charges shall not be considered justification for discharges in excess of local
discharge limits set by the sewer committee or compensation for any damages caused by said excessive
discharge.
(4)
Users shall be deemed to be inside city limit users for the purposes of the rates to be charged (i) when they are
physically located within the city limits of North Little Rock, or (ii) when they are physically located within the
then existing territorial boundaries of an improvement district that received services from the system on
November 13, 1995. Any User not deemed to be an inside city limit user shall be deemed to be an outside user.
(5)
The following rate schedule shall be applied to the acceptance of petroleum contaminated waters (defined as any
water approved by the utility, pursuant to guidelines established by the sewer committee, for disposal in the
system that is part of the remediation of a gasoline or diesel contaminated site and/or is a temporary short term
discharge(s) into the system:
Quantity (Gallons) Rate ($/Gal.)
For the first 05,000 $0.25
For the next 5,00125,000 0.06
For the next 25,001 or above 0.006
(6)
In the case of customers obtaining water exclusively from the waterworks system covering the city ("waterworks
system"), the computation shall be based upon the water consumption records of the waterworks system.
(7)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
337/543
In the case of customers obtaining water from sources other than the waterworks system there shall be
determined the amount of water obtained by such customers from other sources and the amount so determined
shall be used (together with the amount reflected by the waterworks system records if the customer also obtains
water from the waterworks system) in making the computation.
(8)
For residential customers (defined as single family residences or multimetered, multi-family residences or
apartments all of which utilize meters less than one inch) only, the sewer charge each month will be based on the
average monthly consumption for the months of October, November, December, January, February and March
(winter month period). In the case of residential users which were not on a meter during the previous winter
month period, the rates shall be computed on actual water usage until such time as an average monthly winter
usage can be calculated. In the case of other users not on a metered basis, the city shall establish water
consumption based on a comparison of the nonmetered users with a metered user of a similar class.
(9)
None of the facilities or services afforded by the system shall be furnished without a charge being made
therefore.
(10)
The costs of operation and maintenance for all flows not directly attributable to users (such as
infiltration/inflow) shall be distributed among users on the same basis as operation and maintenance charges.
(b)
In the event any special fee or charge is assessed against the Utility by any entity or governmental agency or
department which fee is assessed on a per customer or per meter basis, then the sewer committee, based upon a
finding that the assessment of such fee may affect the efficient and effective operation of the system in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations that may be applicable to the utility from time to time, may
pass the assessment of such fee to the customer as a line item charge stated separately on the customer's monthly
bill.
(c)
Based upon a finding determining the reasonable costs of evaluating and taking action with respect to permits,
license applications and connections of facilities to the system; of implementing, inspecting and enforcing the
terms and conditions of permits, licenses and variances thereof; and of any depreciation or continuing operations
and maintenance expenses incurred or to be incurred by the utility in operating any facilities, the sewer
committee shall have the power to establish reasonable fees for connection of facilities to the system and for the
initial issuance, annual review and modification of discharge permits or other license or permits reasonably
required by the sewer committee to properly operate the system efficiently and effectively in compliance with all
laws and regulations that may be applicable to the utility from time to time. The sewer committee may require
that any fee assessed pursuant to this section shall be paid prior to the issuance of any permit or license or
connection to the system.
(d)
(1)
The city will continuously monitor the revenues of the system, including, specifically, the adequacy of its rates
and delinquent billings, and will take appropriate steps to remedy any delinquent billings or inadequacy of rates.
The city will make a full review annually of the rates and charges of the system.
(2)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
338/543
The city shall at all times fix, charge and collect rates and charges for services furnished by the system,
including increasing rates and charges as necessary, which shall provide revenues sufficient to at least: (1) pay
the city's annual costs of OM & R; (2) pay annual debt service; and (3) provide the necessary bond coverage.
(e)
Vacant, unoccupied but metered property, whether or not using the system, shall be subject to a service charge
equal to the minimum monthly charge for the respective class of properties. Vacant, unoccupied and unmetered
property not actually using the system shall not be subject to a charge, but the burden of demonstrating vacancy,
nonuse and lack of meter to the utility, shall rest upon the owner of the property.
(f)
(1)
All bills for sewer services shall be rendered monthly. In the event payment in full is not made on or before the
tenth day following the original date of billing, a ten percent penalty shall be added to the bill. If any sewer
charge is not paid within 30 days after the same is due, the customer will be notified in writing by the utility
which notice shall state where, during which hours of the day, and before whom disputed bills appropriately may
be considered. If the user waives the opportunity to be heard, suit may be brought to collect the amount due,
together with the expenses of collection and a reasonable attorney's fee, and/or water and/or wastewater services
may be discontinued until such bill is paid.
(2)
Any customer who feels that his charge is unjust and inequitable may make written application to the utility
requesting a review of his charge. Said written request shall, when necessary, show the actual or estimated
average flow and/or strength of his wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the charge is based,
including how the measurements or estimates were made. Review of the request shall be made by the utility and
if substantiated, the charges for that customer shall be recomputed based on the revised flow and/or strength data
and the new charges shall be applicable to the next billing cycle/period.
(g)
A financial management system shall be established and maintained by the city to document compliance with
federal regulations pertaining to the revolving loan. The system will account for all revenues generated and
expenditures for OM & R.
The city will review the user charges at least annually and revise the rates as necessary to ensure that adequate
revenues are generated to pay the costs of operation and maintenance including replacement and that the system
continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance including replacement costs
among users and user classes.
(h)
That each user shall be notified at least annually, in conjunction with the regular bill, of the sewer use rate and
the portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment. Costs shall be broken down to
show the OM & R costs attributed to that user.
(i)
That by the tenth of each calendar month, an amount of $41,666.67 will be transferred to the Rehabilitation
Fund, but only in the event all transfers have first been made into the funds for OM & R and for debt service.

The provisions of Ordinance No. 3096 establishing a sewer revenue fund; Ordinance No. 3623 establishing a
sewer and electric revenue fund; Ordinance No. 2926 establishing an electric revenue fund; Ordinance No. 3961
establishing a sanitation revenue fund; and Ordinance No. 2927 establishing a water revenue fund to the contrary
notwithstanding, all revenues derived from the electric department, sanitation department, sewer department,
and the water department (collectively referred to in this division as the "utilities system") shall be paid into a
special fund, which is hereby created and designated as the North Little Rock Utilities System Revenue Fund.
Such revenues from the utilities system so deposited shall be accounted for and paid in the manner set forth in
this division. The city council has found and determined that joint accounting for and billing for revenues
derived from the utilities system will result in substantial economies of scale, and removal of duplicative
functions of each utility constituting the system, all of which will redound to the benefit of ratepayers and
taxpayers of the city; provided that nothing in this division shall be construed to be a waiver, amendment,
abandonment, alteration, repledge, cross-pledge, or additional pledging of those specific pledges of waterworks
revenues, electric revenues, sewer revenues, sewer and electric revenues or sanitation revenues made in prior
Ordinance Nos. 3096, 3623, 2926, 2927 and 3961, or surplus system revenues in Ordinance No. 3962, all as
amended. The city council has further found and determined that the interrelated activities of the utilities
comprising the utilities system are interrelated municipal activities as was previously found in Ordinance Nos.
3692 and 3623, and such interrelation allows the handling of revenues in the manner set forth in this division.

negotiation to the utilities accounting department of any checks, drafts or remittances subsequently dishonored
for any reason.
(b)
The custodian of the fund created by this section shall be the utilities accounting department manager, who shall
be the primary signatory on all checks drawn from the insufficient funds account; provided, there may be
additional authorized signatories for this account designated by the utilities accounting department manager with
the approval of the utilities accounting department.

Sec. 106-44. - Findings of council.
The city council has found and determined that the charges assessed as stated in this division are necessary and
proper expenses for billing customers of the utilities system and are less than the aggregate costs of billing for
each component of the utilities system when serviced individually. Further, the city council has found and
determined that the methodology of billing and paying for the costs thereof will not affect the ability of the city
to make payments to reserves established by prior city ordinance for bonded indebtedness secured by utility or
surplus utility revenues.

For existing customers, and as a condition for continuation of electric service, a deposit may be required or the
deposit amount increased if any of the following conditions occurred during the last 12 months:
(1)
Service has been discontinued for failure to pay a past due billing;
(2)
Two insufficient fund checks have been returned from the bank to the electric department or utilities accounting
department;
(3)
The customer has failed to pay his electric bill by the due date six times within the last 12 months;
(4)
The customer has misrepresented himself for the purpose of obtaining service; or
(5)
The customer has engaged in unauthorized or fraudulent use, such as tampering with meter or other NLRED
property, in an attempt to deprive NLRED of electric service revenue. If fraudulent use exists, NLRED shall
request an additional deposit, subject to refund, as provided in this division, plus a nonrefundable payment for
damage, plus proof of payment of all fees or fines assessed by the code enforcement officer.
(b)
When any commercial customer is disconnected for nonpayment and the amount of cash deposit or surety bond
which was originally secured is determined to be inadequate, then a total deposit amount or surety bond
equivalent to two estimated maximum bills may be required, at the discretion of the head of the electric
department or his designate. The methodology for computing any additional deposit shall be to subtract from the
sum determined by twice the highest bill for any one billing period the deposit amount on file and rounding up
to the nearest multiple of $5.00. For example:
Twice the highest month's bill ..... $198.16
Current deposit ..... 50.00
$148.16

supply system serving the city, giving the names of both the owner and the occupant of the premises, and if such
owner or occupant has not made application to the city council for the privilege of maintaining such cross
connection, the city council shall cause the city clerk to notify such owner, occupant or both, as the case may be,

No discharger shall discharge wastewater to the public sewer system which shall cause the POTW to which the
sewer system is tributary to fail to meet the NPDES discharge limits for the POTW, or fail to meet the limits
imposed by the Arkansas Water Quality Standards (latest revision). The sewer committee of the wastewater
utility shall adopt and impose discharge limits for any and all users of the system, as required to meet these
standards. The discharge limits shall be technology based limits predicated on the capability of the respective
treatment facility to receive and to treat the wastewater load, or headworks loading, and (i) to meet the required
discharge standards, (ii) to prevent interference with the function and efficiency of the various treatment
processes, and (iii) to prevent contamination of the treatment plant waste sludges which would prevent their
ultimate disposal by landfill. The sewer committee shall establish limits for industrial dischargers based on an
allocation of the treatment plant capacity to all industrial users without regard to the flow or type of discharge.
Commercial and residential users which are not classified as significant users shall not be so allocated. The
allowable industrial contribution shall be the difference between the technology based allowable headworks
factor of safety or reserve capacity established by the sewer committee. However, the sewer committee shall
have the authority to require the selective further reduction of a contaminant by the greater contributors of that
contaminant to the POTW if the headworks loading of the contaminant exceeds the capability of the POTW to
meet the discharge standards.
The headworks analysis may include, but shall not be limited to the following parameters:

authority for any and all cost or expense due to damages caused to the system by the discharge.
(4)
Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this
division.
(b)
Submission of pertinent data to manager. Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to
discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent
data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall first be submitted to the manager
for review and approval. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge of such facilities from compliance with
any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent
alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to
and prior approval of the manager.
(c)
Responsibility for operation and maintenance. If pretreatment or control of waste flows is required, such

any hour under emergency conditions. The condition of what constitutes an emergency condition shall be at the
discretion of the manager.
(g)
Protection from accidental discharge. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
manager for review, and shall be approved by him before construction of the facility. Review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division.
(h)
Noncompliant discharge procedure. If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable to
comply with any prohibition or limitations in this division, the facility responsible for such discharge shall
immediately notify the manager so that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In
addition, a written report addressed to the manager detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge,
the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall
be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
(Code 1980, § 32-212)
Sec. 106-278. - Reports, records and inspections.
(a)
Discharge reports.
(1)
Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge report at such intervals as are designated by the
manager. The manager may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing to discharge into the
treatment system to file such periodic reports.
(2)
The discharge report shall include, but, at the discretion of the manager, shall not be limited to, nature of
process, volume, rates of flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation, concentrations of
controlled pollutants, or other information which relates to the generation of waste. Such reports may also
include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on-site even though they are not
normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the manager may require information in the form of a selfmonitoring
report.
(b)
Records and monitoring.
(1)
All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall
maintain such records of production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or concentration
as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this division and any applicable state or
federal pretreatment standards or requirements.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
376/543
(2)
Such records shall be made available upon request by the manager. All such records relating to compliance with

own cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and
measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times.
(4)
The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the
building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the manager may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency
having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping, or parked vehicles.
(5)
When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the manager may require installation of separate
monitoring equipment for each user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the manager may require that separate
monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge.
(6)
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance
with the manager's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
(c)
Inspection, sampling and analysis.
(1)
Compliance determinations with respect to section 106-273, prohibitions and limitations, may be made on the
basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be
taken over a 24-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the manager to
meet the needs of specific circumstances.
(2)
Sampling and laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR 136, with any subsequent amendments. Analysis of those pollutants not covered by this document shall be

convenience. Approval/disapproval shall be based upon the criteria set forth in this division. If the city hires a

revenue officer at some later time, then all duties imposed upon the city clerk by this division shall be
automatically and exclusively assumed by the revenue officer. Any further reference in this division to the duties
of the city clerk would, in that case, be deemed to be entirely those of the revenue officer.
(Code 1980, § 30-22)
Sec. 114-43. - Prerequisites for issuance.
Before any certificate of public convenience and necessity required by this division is issued for the operation of
a taxicab, the owner shall meet with the following provisions:
(1)
Fixed place of business. Every person operating any taxicab within the city shall maintain a fixed location, to be
approved by the privilege tax officer; and, except when carrying passengers, answering calls, going to and from
officially designated taxicab stands, or attending to lawful business of the owner other than the carrying of
passengers for hire, every taxicab shall be kept off the streets of the city, except that they may occupy officially
designated taxicab stands as provided under this division. Such persons must use their home address or their
place of business for service of process and other legal matters.
(2)
Change of business address. Each owner is required to notify the city and the revenue officer immediately upon
change of business address. Failure to so notify is grounds for immediate revocation of such certificate.
(3)
Inspection and approval. No taxicab shall be operated on or over the streets, alleys or public ways of the city
until inspected and approved by the revenue officer, showing that such taxicab complies with the provisions of
this division. Such approval shall be registered with the city. If any taxicab operated on or over the streets of the
city does not comply with the provisions of this division, a hearing before the city council will be called to
determine if the certificate should be revoked or suspended.
(4)
Safety standards. Every taxicab operating on the streets, alleys and public ways of the city shall at all times meet
all safety standards required by state and federal law. The city council is authorized to establish additional
regulations with respect to equipment and maintenance and any other operating rules as appropriate.
(5)
Insurance. Before any taxicab franchise is issued for the operation of a taxicab, the owner shall file with the city
and revenue officer a copy of the policy of insurance issued by some good and solvent incorporated insurance
company licensed to do business in the state, covering separately, or in a schedule attached to such policy, each
taxicab to be operated under the direction of such owner. Such owner is required to maintain the insurance
policy in accordance with state law. The amount of liability insurance required by the city will be that set out in
the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act (A.C.A. § 27-19-101 et seq.). Each insurance company and owner
is required to notify the city upon lapse or cancellation of any such policy. Upon the lapse of such policy, the
certificate granted to such owner is automatically revoked as of the date the insurance ceases to be in effect; and
it will thereafter be unlawful to operate such taxicab upon the streets, public ways or alleys of the city. Such
liability insurance shall be specifically for the operation of taxicabs or limousines as vehicles for hire, and such
fact shall be expressly indicated upon any policy certificates or evidence of insurance.
(6)

vehicles. This number shall be at least four inches in height; letters of the company name shall be at least 1¾
inches in height. Both the number and name of the company shall be permanently affixed to the taxicab, in
contrasting colors, so long as the vehicle is part of a company fleet. Each independently owned cab vehicle must
state that it is an independently operated taxicab.
(7)
Transfer. No certificate granted under this division may be sold, assigned, transferred, leased or mortgaged.

Subdivision III. - Commercial Districts
Sec. 117-88. - Generally.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
487/543
Certain areas of the city are designated as commercial districts. These districts are designed to permit the
transaction of the various types of business in separate areas, and in surroundings conducive to the particular
type of business, without interference to surrounding areas and developed to avoid traffic congestion, traffic
hazards and with ample parking. It is intended that each district should provide for good traffic and pedestrian
circulation, eliminating all possible conflicts between the two, and the developing of open spaces, landscape,
green and planted areas of sufficient size and number to enhance each business and create in the city centers of
outstanding beauty, convenience and attractiveness.
(Ord. No. 3171, § 702.2(A), 3-26-62; Ord. No. 3696, § 1, 9-9-68)
Sec. 117-89. - Effect of district designation; procedure.
The designation of an area as a C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 or C-5 district may be accomplished as provided in this
chapter, in action started by the planning commission, or upon applications by interested parties. In the latter
case, there shall be presented a preliminary development plan which shall be the basis for the development plan,
and shall show all street rights-of-way, proposed zone, boundaries, and location and general type use for all
buildings. In all cases, before any designation is given, there shall be a public hearing as provided for in section
118-40. The designation of an area as a commercial zone shall cause the conditions and requirements set forth in
sections 118-223 and 118-224 hereof to come into full force and effect. Such designation shall not create any
right to erect or alter any structures or to apply for a permit therefor, nor shall such right exist until the filing,
approval and registration of a commercial development plan as hereinafter set forth. Whenever a failure to
comply with the provisions of this subdivision occurs, no permit shall be issued for the erection or alteration of
any structures in the area and all issued permits therefor shall be terminated and cancelled until the area included
within the area has been examined by the commission and zoned or rezoned for its most appropriate use. Any
applicant for the designation of an area as a C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 or C-5 district, whether under disability or
otherwise and including the successors and assigns thereof, shall be deemed conclusively to have assented to all
of these conditions.

Sec. 117-95. - C-1 quiet business district.
(a)
Description of district. The C-1 quiet business district is composed of certain lands and structures used primarily
to provide office space for uses related to professional type services either for the residents of nearby residential
areas or characterized by a low volume of direct daily customer contact. Usually this district is located on
thoroughfares, characteristically is small in size and is usually situated between business and residential areas.
The regulations are designed to permit development of the functions specified under C-1 in the list of permitted
uses, limited by standards designed to protect surrounding residential districts. To these ends the regulations
establish standards comparable to those for residential districts, resulting in similar open space and building bulk
and retaining the low concentration of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
(b)
Limitation of external effects of uses. Within not more than two years from the date on which this chapter is
passed, every use shall be made to comply with the limitation of external uses outlined in the general regulations
(section 118-161).
(c)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front line and shall be occupied only by one structure
containing a permitted use and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to the permitted

lot area as unobstructed open space.
(3)
Minimum front yard. All structures shall be set back a distance of not less than 25 feet from the front property
line or as required in other ordinances, whichever is greater.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
493/543
(4)
Minimum side yards. There shall be two side yards to each lot. The minimum required side yard shall be not less
than ten percent of the width at the front building line, but in no case shall it be less than six feet, with eight feet
the maximum required, except that any side yard abutting a street shall be at least 15 feet, unless under the
master street plan, as existing or amended, or other ordinance a greater setback is required for the purpose of
street widening or for other reasons.
(5)
Minimum rear yard. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than 25 feet.
(6)
Maximum height. No building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall exceed 2½ stories or 35 feet in
height.
(7)

within five feet of any lot line, that is not a street line. Fences up to 96 inches in height may be erected along any
boundary of the side yards or rear yard from the rear of the lot forward to the rear of the main structure. A fence
60 inches in height may be erected along the side yards from the rear of the main structure forward to the front
building line. Any fence or screen constructed in the required front yard must have planning commission
approval as to location, height and construction.
(8)
Screens. All C-1 uses shall provide an approved screen between abutting residential areas, so as to protect these
areas by day and night from unreasonable disturbance by movement of people or vehicles, and from noises or
exposure to views not fully compatible with residential areas. Such screens should permit the passage of air and
be of pleasing design.
(f)
Off-street parking. The provisions of section 118-311, Off-street parking requirements, shall be in full force and
effect in C-1 district.
(g)
Corner visibility. On a corner lot, within the areas formed by the right-of-way lines of intersecting streets and a
line joining points on such right-of-way lines at a distance of 25 feet from their intersections, there shall be no
obstruction to vision between a height of two feet and a height of ten feet above the average grade of each street
at the centerline thereof, except that street name signs, fire hydrants, street lighting poles and associated
appurtenances thereto shall be permitted within this area.
(h)
Planned building groups. The provisions of section 118-313, Planned building groups, may be applied in the C-1
district.
(Ord. No. 3171, § 702.2-1, 3-26-62)
Sec. 117-96. - C-2 local shopping center district.
(a)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
494/543
Description of district. The C-2 local shopping center district is composed of certain lands that should be a
minimum of one acre in size and structures used primarily to provide the retailing of commodities classed by
merchants as convenience goods. The volume of pedestrian traffic in proportion to automobile traffic in the
district is much higher than in other retail business districts. This district characteristically is small, almost
always is surrounded by residential districts and is located at a convenient walking distance from the edges of
the surrounding residential districts it is designed to serve. The regulations are designed to permit development
of the functions specified in the list of permitted uses, limited by standards designed to protect the surrounding
residential districts. To these ends, the regulations establish standards comparable to those for residential
districts, resulting in similar building bulk and retaining the relatively low concentration of vehicular traffic as
compared to other retail business districts. Of great importance is the necessity that the areas selected for this
district actually be developed as permitted. To ensure the provision of essential retail services to a neighborhood,
the privilege of providing these services is matched by the responsibility and duty to so provide. Consequently,
the right to develop this district may be lost if actual development does not occur. In some instances, this district
may not be located pending the development of sections of the city and may therefore be considered a floating
zone; however, once such a zone is established in any area of the city, and the need for neighborhood shopping
facilities having been met, the district shall be fixed and no further applications for such zones will be
considered in that area.
(b)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front line and shall be occupied by one structure containing
permitted uses, and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to the permitted use, provided,
however, that it shall not be a residence.
(c)
Permitted uses. In the C-2 district only those uses specified under C-2 in the list of permitted uses, section 118-
134 of these regulations, will be permitted, provided such uses are operated only at retail and shall not be
operated as commercial wholesale.
(d)
Dimensional requirements. The lot for each structure shall comply with the following dimensional and area
requirements:
(1)
Lot width. Each lot shall be not less than 80 feet wide at the front building line.
(2)
Lot area. The lot shall be not less than one acre in area, and shall provide not less than 60 percent of the area as
unobstructed open space, except for use as an off-street parking space.
(3)
Minimum front yard. All structures shall be set back a distance of not less than 40 feet from each front property
line, or as required in other ordinances, whichever is the greater. At least one additional foot of setback shall be
provided for each foot that a building on the lot exceeds 35 feet.
(4)
Minimum side yard. No side yards are required except where the zone abuts a residential area, in which case a
side yard of 15 feet is required on the side or sides abutting the residential area. In all other cases where side
yards are provided they shall be not less than eight feet in width.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
495/543
(5)
Minimum rear yard. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than 20 feet; provided that, where the
rear lot line abuts an alley and the property on the other side of the alley is not within a residential zone, then the
minimum rear yard requirement shall be a depth of not less than 15 feet. Where the rear lot line abuts onto a
street the rear building line shall be the building setback line established for that street.
(6)
Location of accessory buildings. No accessory buildings shall be located on any required front or side yard, or
within five feet of any lot line, that is not a street line, except that street name signs, fire hydrants, street lighting
poles and associated appurtenances thereto shall be permitted within this area.
(7)
Screens. All C-2 uses shall provide a screen between abutting residential or C-1 business areas, so as to protect
these areas by day and by night from unreasonable disturbance by movement of people or vehicles, and from
lights, noises or exposure to views not compatible with these areas. Such screens shall be pleasing in design, and
of substantial material, easily maintained.
(e)
Off-street parking. The provisions of section 118-311, Off-street parking requirements, shall be in full force and
effect in this district.
(f)
Off-street loading requirements. The provisions of section 118-312, Off-street loading requirements, shall be in
full force and effect in this district.
(g)
Corner visibility. On a corner lot, within the area formed by the right-of-way lines of intersecting streets and a
line joining points on such right-of-way lines at a distance of 25 feet from their intersection, there shall be no
obstruction to vision between a height of two feet and a height of ten feet above the average grade of each street
at the centerline thereof, except that street name signs, fire hydrants, street lighting poles and associated
appurtenances thereto shall be permitted within this area.
(h)
Planned building groups. The provisions of section 118-313, Planned building groups, shall be in full force and
effect in the C-2 district.
(i)
District designation and development plan provisions. The provisions of the general regulations for commercial

Sec. 117-97. - C-3 community shopping district.
(a)
Description of district. The C-3 community shopping district is composed of certain land and structures used
primarily to provide the retailing of commodities classed by merchants as general apparel and furnishings. The
volume of pedestrian traffic in proportion to automobile traffic entering the district is relatively low. This district
is usually located on a major arterial highway, characteristically is large, and should be at least three acres in
area, almost always is entirely surrounded by residential or C-1 districts and is located at a convenient driving
distance from the edges of the surrounding residential districts it is designed to serve. The regulations are
designed to provide for development of the permitted uses limited by standards designed to protect the abutting
or surrounding residential districts. To these ends, the regulations establish standards comparable to those for
residential districts, resulting in similar building bulk and retaining as low a concentration of vehicular traffic as
is compatible with the functioning of the district. Of great importance is the necessity that the areas selected for
this district actually be developed as permitted. To ensure the provision of essential major retail services to a
community, the privilege of providing these services is matched by the responsibility and duty to so provide.
Consequently, the right to develop this district may be lost if actual development does not occur.
(b)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front property line and shall be occupied only by structures
containing permitted uses and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to and are operated
and maintained by the owner as tenant of the permitted use, provided, however, that it shall not be a residence.
(c)
Permitted uses.
(1)
In the C-3 district only those uses specified under C-3 in the list of permitted uses, section 118-134 of these
regulations, will be permitted.
(2)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the temporary display of mobile homes,
boats, cars, farm implements and similar items is a permitted use in the C-3 zoning district if approval is
obtained from the director of the planning commission and a special permit is obtained from the revenue officer
of the city. The special permit allows such use for a period of seven days at the location specified in the permit
and is renewable for an additional period of seven days upon approval of the planning director. The fee for the
permit is $25.00 for the first four days and $5.00 for each day thereafter.
(d)
Dimensional requirements. The lot for the C-3 commercial district shall comply with the following dimensional
and area requirements:
(1)
Lot area. The lot area shall be not less than 130,680 square feet of which 60 percent shall remain as unobstructed
open space; provided, however, that this open space may be used for parking and landscaped areas.
(2)
Minimum front yard. All structures shall be set back a distance of not less than 40 feet from each front property
line, or as required in other ordinances, whichever is the greater; provided, however, that, where the height of
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
497/543
any building exceeds 45 feet as permitted under these district regulations, the front yard setback shall be
increased at least one foot for each foot of increased structure height above 45 feet.
(3)
Side yards. No side yard is required except where the zone abuts a residential area, in which case a side yard of
15 feet is required on the side or sides abutting the residential area; provided, however, that where the zone abuts
a street the side yard setback established for that street shall be maintained, or the setback shall be as required by
other ordinances, whichever is greater. In all other cases where side yards are provided they shall be not less than
eight feet in width; provided, however, that, where the height of any building exceeds 45 feet as permitted under
these district regulations, the side yard setback shall be increased one foot for each increment of five feet of
increased structure height above 45 feet up to the maximum permitted height.
(4)
Minimum rear yard. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than 20 feet; provided that where the
rear lot line abuts an alley and the property on the other side of the alley is not within a residential zone, then the
minimum rear yard requirement shall be a depth of not less than 15 feet. Where the rear lot line abuts onto a
street the rear building line shall be the building setback line established for that street.
(5)
Location of accessory buildings. No accessory buildings shall be located in any required front or side yard, or
within five feet of any lot line, that is not a street line. Fences up to 96 inches in height may be erected along any
boundary of the side yards or rear yard from the rear of the lot forward to the rear of the main structure. A fence
60 inches in height may be erected along the side yards from the rear of the main structure forward to the front
building line. Any fence or screen constructed in the required front yard must have planning commission
approval as to location, height, material and construction.
(6)
Screens. All C-3 uses shall provide a screen between abutting residential or C-1 business areas, so as to protect
these areas by day and by night from unreasonable disturbance by movement of people or vehicles from lights,
noises or exposure to views not compatible with these areas. Such screens shall be pleasing in design, and of a
substantial material, easily maintained.
(e)
Off-street parking. The provisions of section 118-311, Off-street parking requirements, shall be in full force and
effect in C-3 district.
(f)
Corner visibility. On a corner lot, within the areas formed by the right-of-way lines of intersecting streets and a
line joining points on such right-of-way lines at a distance of 25 feet from their intersection, there shall be no
obstruction to vision between a height of two feet and a height of ten feet above the average grade of each street
at the centerline thereof, except that street name signs, fire hydrants, street lighting poles and associated
appurtenances thereto shall be permitted within this area.
(g)
Planned building groups. The provisions of section 118-313, Planned building groups, shall be in full force and
effect in the C-3 district.

District designation and development plan provisions. The provisions of the general regulations for commercial
districts, sections 118-221 through 118-224 inclusive, shall be in full force and effect in the C-3 district.
(Ord. No. 3171, § 702.2-3, 3-26-62; Ord. No. 3914, § 1, 4-26-71; Ord. No. 4300, §§ 1, 2, 12-10-73)
Sec. 117-98. - C-4 trade fair district.
(a)
Description of district. The C-4 district is a recognition of the unfortunate commercial strip development which
has occurred along some of the highways in the city. The purpose of this district is to contain this commercial
strip development, to permit infilling of vacant areas within the zone and by establishing standards of
development to encourage owners and tenants to improve their properties, to remove some of the hazards that
this type of development create and to promote developments that are pleasing to see, and to fit into the overall
city and business pattern. The creation of this district is a recognition of what is and it should not be used to
extend into other areas commercial strip development. This district is composed of certain land and structures
used primarily to provide retailing and personal and recreational services and temporary housing, for
nonresidents of the district and transients using the main arterial highways, to provide business services in
support of the primary activities in the central business district and to provide locations for certain limited light
industrial activities which require a higher degree of protection than is afforded in industrial districts. As a
secondary function retailing and personal services may be provided to residents of nearby areas. The volume of
pedestrian traffic in proportion to automobile traffic is relatively low. This district is usually located paralleling
arterial highways or in areas adjacent to the central business district. Characteristically, it is large, and sometimes
abuts residential districts. The regulations are designed to allow completion of development for permitted
functions, limited by standards designed to protect the surrounding residential districts and to create welldesigned
and pleasing areas along highways. To these ends, the regulations establish standards retaining as low
an intensity of use and concentration of vehicles as is compatible with the functioning of the district.
(b)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front line and shall be occupied only by one structure
containing a permitted use and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to the permitted
use, provided, however, that it shall not be a permanent residence.
(c)
Permitted uses. In the C-4 district only those uses specified under C-4 in the list of permitted uses, section 118-
134 of these regulations, will be permitted.
(d)
Dimensional requirements. The lot for each permitted use shall comply with the following dimensional area
requirements:
(1)
Lot width. Each lot shall be not less than 100 feet wide at the front building line.
(2)
Lot area. The lot area shall be not less than 10,000 square feet, and shall provide not less than 50 percent of the
area as unobstructed open space.
(3)

499/543
Minimum front yard. All structures shall be set back a distance of not less than 40 feet from the front property
line or as required in other ordinances, whichever is the greater. At least one additional foot of setback shall be
provided for each foot that a building on the lot exceeds 35 feet.
(4)
Side yards. No side yards are required except where the zone abuts a residential area, in which case a side yard
of 15 feet is required on the side or sides abutting the residential area; provided, however, that where the zone
abuts a street the side yard setback established for that street shall be maintained or the setback shall be as
required by other ordinances, whichever is greater. In all other cases where side yards are provided they shall be
not less than eight feet in width.
(5)
Minimum rear yard. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than 20 feet; provided that, where the
rear lot line abuts an alley and the property on the other side of the alley is not within a residential zone, then the
minimum rear yard requirement shall be a depth of not less than 15 feet. Where the rear lot line abuts onto a
street the rear building line shall be the building setback line established for that street.
(6)
Location of accessory buildings. No accessory building shall be located on any required front or side yards, or
within five feet of any lot line, that is not a street line. Fences up to 96 inches in height may be erected along any
boundary of the side yards or rear yard from the rear of the lot forward to the rear of the main structure. A fence
60 inches in height may be erected along the side yards from the rear of the main structure forward to the front
building line. Any fence or screen constructed in the required front yard must have planning commission
approval as to location, height, material and construction.
(7)
Screens. All C-4 uses shall provide a screen between abutting residential or C-1 business areas, so as to protect
these areas by day and by night from unreasonable disturbance by movement of people or vehicles, and from
lights, noises or exposure to views not compatible with these areas. Such screens shall be pleasing in design, and
of a substantial material, easily maintained.
(e)

Sec. 117-99. - C-5 central business district.
(a)
Description of district. The C-5 central business district is composed of certain land and structures used
primarily to provide retailing and personal and business service of all kinds satisfying the needs of transients
generally and of the residents, business and industry of the metropolitan area and the outlying trade area, plus
wholesaling and limited manufacturing in support of the primary functions. The volume of pedestrian traffic in
proportion to the volume of automobile and public transit traffic entering the district is very low. This district is
located at the area of convergence of the main arterial highways and transit lines, is large, is usually surrounded
by nonresidential districts or by high-density residential districts and is centrally located with respect to the
metropolitan area. The regulations are designed to permit a highly concentrated, intensive development of the
permitted facilities, limited by standards designed to provide light and air for street exposures of buildings in the
district and to protect the district itself from over-intensive development of land coverage and over-congestion as
related to the ultimate capacity of common public facilities which serve the entire district. Because transit
facilities are centered in this district and because the provision of off-street parking is a recognized, separate
business enterprise, the regulations do not require the furnishing of off-street parking space; but in the interest of
the individual business venture and the central business district as a whole, individuals or groups are encouraged
to provide adequate off-street parking. Where extensions, redevelopment or new areas of this C-5 district are
proposed and they exceed 100,000 square feet in area, then the owners and developers shall submit a complete
development plan for the extension, redevelopment or new area, as provided for in the general commercial
provisions. Although existing downtown areas have developed without benefit of setbacks, off-street parking
areas or landscaping, all owners and tenants in downtown areas are encouraged to incorporate these
improvements in any individual or group development of lots in the downtown C-5 district.
(b)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front line and shall be occupied only by structures
containing permitted uses, and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to the permitted
use.
(c)
Permitted uses. In the C-5 district only those uses specified under C-5 in the list of permitted uses, section 118-
134 of these regulations, will be permitted.
(d)
Dimensional requirements. The lot for each permitted use shall comply with the following dimensional and area
requirements:
(1)
Lot width. Each lot shall be not less than 25 feet wide at the front building line.
(2)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
501/543
Lot area. The lot area shall be not less than 2,500 square feet.
(3)
Minimum front yard. There shall be no front yard requirements for the C-5 district other than the following:
a.
A front yard is required where other ordinances require a setback.
b.
A front yard is required in compliance with the provisions of an adjoining district where a part of the frontage is
in a district requiring front yards.
c.
If a building on a lot exceeds 90 feet in height, all buildings on the lot will be set back from the property line at
least one foot for each foot that a building on the lot exceeds 90 feet in height.
(4)
Minimum side yards. No side yards shall be required under this chapter, but they shall be provided if required
under other ordinances or in compliance with the provisions of an adjoining district where a part of the side yard
is in that district. If a side yard or yards are provided, they shall be not less than eight feet in width.
(5)
Minimum rear yard. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than ten feet, provided, however, that
this yard may be built over by upper floors of the same structure at a height of not less than 15 feet from the
alley or adjacent street level, and further provided that, where the rear yard abuts a street which has a front yard
requirement, this setback shall be maintained.
(6)
Maximum gross floor area of structures. The sum total of the gross floor area of all structures on a lot, including
garage space, shall not be greater than ten times the area of the lot on which the structures are located.
(7)
Off-street parking. The provisions of section 118-311, Off-street parking requirements, shall be of no force and
effect in this C-5 district, unless otherwise mentioned herein.
(8)
Off-street loading requirements. The provisions of section 118-312, Off-street loading requirements, shall be in
full force and effect in this district.
(9)

Sec. 117-123. - I-1 community industrial park district.
(a)
Description of district. The I-1 community industrial park district is composed of certain lands located between
general industrial or commercial uses and quiet residential areas and of certain other lands so located that
residential development is in close proximity. The regulations of this district are intended to provide structural
standards, standards of intensity of use and standards of external effects compatible with the surrounding
residential districts. To these ends, development standards are established to encourage those industries and
wholesaling activities which can be operated in a clean and quiet manner, plus certain public facilities which are
needed to serve the occupants of the district and residents of adjoining residential districts, and to establish
pleasant community industrial parks.
(b)
General conditions. The general conditions applying to all zone districts and the general conditions applying to
industrial zone districts shall be in full force and effect in the I-1 district.
(c)
Permitted structures. Each lot shall have at least one front property line and shall be occupied only by structures
containing permitted uses and such accessory buildings as are clearly incidental and normal to and are operated
and maintained by the owner or tenant of the permitted use, provided, however, that it shall not be a residence.
(d)
Permitted uses. In the I-1 district, only those uses specified under I-1 in the list of permitted uses, section 118-
134 of these regulations, will be permitted.

requirements:
(1)
Minimum front yard. All structures shall be set back a distance of not less than 30 feet from each front property
line, or as required in other ordinances, whichever is greater; provided, however, that, where the height of any
structure exceeds 35 feet as permitted under these district regulations, the front yard setback shall be increased
one foot for each increment of five feet of increased structure height above 45 up to the maximum permitted
height.
(2)
Minimum side yards. There shall be two side yards to each lot. The minimum required side yard width shall not
be less than ten percent of the lot width at the front building line, but in no case shall it be less than 15 feet,
except that any side yard abutting a street shall be at least 25 feet, unless under the master street plan, as existing
or amended, or other ordinances a greater setback is required for the purpose of street widening or for other
reasons, provided, however, that when structures on abutting lots share a common rail facility extending along
the side of the building the side yard on that side of the building may be reduced with the commission's approval

Secs. 117-126117-147. - Reserved.
Subdivision V. - Other Districts
Sec. 117-148. - PUD-R-7 planned unit development district.
(a)
Statement of purpose. It is the intent of this section to encourage developments with superior living
environments brought about through unified development and to provide for the application of design ingenuity
in such developments while protecting existing and future surrounding developments and achieving the goals of
the comprehensive plan of development for the city. The PUD planned unit development district herein
established is intended to provide for greater flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts, circulation and
open space than would otherwise be possible through the strict application of other district regulations, and to
produce:
(1)
A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units available to the public;
(2)
Open space and recreation areas;
(3)
A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural topography and geologic features, and
prevents soil erosion;
(4)
A creative approach to the use of land and related physical development;
(5)
An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lowering costs;
(6)
An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding developments; and
(7)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
514/543
A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of other sections of this
chapter.
The PUD planned unit development district regulations are designed to provide for small- and large-scale
developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential, commercial and related uses which are
planned and developed as a unit. Such development may consist of individual lots or it may have common
building sites. Private or public common land and open space must be an essential and major element of the plan
which is related to and affects the longterm value of the homes and other development. A planned unit shall be a
separate entity with a distinct character in harmony with surrounding development.
(b)
Authority. The authority for the establishment of these regulations was granted by A.C.A. tit. 14, ch. 56, subch. 4
(A.C.A. § 14-56-401 et seq.).
(c)
Applicability. The PUD planned unit development district is created as a special zone and shall be so designated
by a zone classification "PUD" with boundaries on the zoning district map. All lands within the corporate limits
and such other lands outside the corporate limits over which the city exercises zoning jurisdiction as permitted
by Arkansas Statutes shall be eligible for designation as a PUD. The standards, design criteria and procedures
adopted herein are designed to enable the district to operate in harmony with the plan for land use and
population density embodied in this chapter.
(d)
Standards of development.
(1)
Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development district shall be owned, leased or otherwise
controlled by a person, firm, group of individuals, partnership, corporation or trust, provided assurances are
given through the procedures contained herein that the project can be successfully completed.
(2)
Minimum district area. The minimum area for a PUD planned unit development district shall be three acres. In
calculating the minimum area for a PUD district, the measurements shall include the area of all dedicated streets
entirely within the boundary of the proposed PUD and one-half of the area of all boundary or perimeter streets.
(3)
Uses permitted. Property and buildings in a PUD district shall be as follows:
a.
Single-family attached and detached residences, two-family dwelling units and multiple-family dwelling units
including triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses, row houses, garden apartments, condominiums and high-rises.
b.
Public and semipublic parks; and private common areas, playgrounds, landscaped areas and greenbelts
maintained by a homeowners' association.
c.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
515/543
Public uses such as schools and churches.
d.
Clubs and lodges; golf course and club.
e.
Docks and marinas.
f.
Public utility facilities and rights-of-way.
g.
C-1 and C-2 commercial uses.
(4)
Special permit uses.
a.
In addition to the above permitted uses by right, certain other uses may be permitted in accordance with the
restrictions included herein. These uses more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other
uses permitted in the PUD district and as such they require special considerations and restrictions. The following
uses are designated as special permit uses:
1.
C-3 and C-4 commercial uses.
2.
I-1 and I-2 industrial uses.
b.
In applying for a special permit use to be included as a part of a PUD district, the applicant shall precisely
indicate the specific use, its location, area to be included, building square footage and such other information as
required by the planning commission to properly and comprehensively evaluate the nature and impact of such
special permit use.
c.
Where such special permit uses are approved at the time of rezoning they shall not be subsequently changed to
any other use until and unless they are changed to another use that is permitted by right, i.e. a C-1 or C-2
commercial use, or the new proposed use if not permitted by right in a PUD district is resubmitted for rezoning
approval. No zoning permit for a change of use shall be issued by the planning commission for any such special
permit use area or structure unless the above conditions are fully complied with.
(5)
Parking and off-street loading.
a.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
516/543
Off public right-of-way parking shall be provided for each use within the PUD district in accordance with
section 118-311, Off-street parking requirements, of this chapter.
b.
Off-street loading space shall be provided for each use within the PUD district in accordance with section 118-
312, Off-street loading requirements, of this chapter.
(6)
Perimeter requirements. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this district, all uses of land or structures
located on a lot within the PUD that are adjacent to the boundary of the PUD district or adjacent to any boundary
or perimeter street right-of-way shall comply with the following:
a.
All residential uses and structures on the perimeter of this district shall meet the dimensional requirements of the
district they abut.
b.
All commercial or other nonresidential uses and structures on the perimeter of this district shall meet the
dimensional requirements of the C-1 commercial quiet business district.
(7)
Area and lot regulations. Uses of land and structures of the PUD district shall comply with the following:
a.
Every structure containing dwelling units shall have direct access to a public street, except for row or terrace
housing, which may have access via a court, walkway or other area of common ownership that is owned and
maintained by a homes association.
b.
No minimum lot size or setbacks shall be required for structures within this district. However, not less than 40
percent of the lot area must be retained as unobstructed open space.
c.
All unattached residential structures must be at least 12 feet in horizontal distance to any other structure.
d.
If any structures are closer than ten feet to another structure, then an approved firewall shall be installed.
(8)
Residential density standards. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within a PUD district is
dependent upon both the type and number of each type of residential units intended to be included in the PUD
district. Micro densities within certain areas of the PUD may be beyond the overall limits through a transfer of
density. However, overall project densities shall not be exceeded in accordance with the following schedule:
a.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
517/543
Six dwelling units per net residential acre for single-family attached and detached houses and two-family
dwellings.
b.
Twelve dwellings per net residential acre for triplexes, fourplexes and row or terrace housing.
c.
Twenty-two dwellings per net residential acre for low-rise (three stories or less) apartments.
d.
Thirty dwellings per net residential acre for high-rise (four stories or more) apartments.
For purposes of calculating density, net residential acres are defined as gross acres of the PUD site minus all
public rights-of-way, and less the area of all parcels of lots devoted to commercial, industrial or institutional uses
not of a residential nature. Common open space that is owned and maintained by a homeowners' association
shall be included in calculating the net residential acres available for all dwelling units that automatically belong
to such an association. Where more than one homeowners' association is to be created, then each common open
space can only be attributed to the lots or dwellings which have automatic membership for that specific common
open area.
(9)
Common open space requirements.
a.
Common open space constitutes an essential ingredient in a planned unit development and is one of the most
basic and important design elements. Open space should be distributed more or less equitably throughout the
PUD district in relationship to the dwelling units and areas that are intended to be served by the common open
space. Common open space is composed of one or more parcels of land that are reserved for the use and
enjoyment of all or a significant portion of the PUD residents and owned and maintained in common by them,
usually through a homeowners' association. However, it is permissible for all or a portion of the common open
space requirements included in this section to be met through the provision of public park lands within the PUD
district. In such cases, however, all lands must comply with all of the regulations included herein as to size,
location usability, etc., in order to qualify as meeting the requirements of this section. Also, in such cases it shall
be the responsibility of the developer to obtain written approval in advance from the appropriate public agency
or body responsible for public parks as to their willingness to accept dedication of such areas as public parks.
b.
The design criteria and regulations included herein are concerned with both the quantity and the quality of the
open spaces that are to be provided. All of the various requirements must be complied with as follows:
1.
Minimum required amount. A minimum of 20 percent of all the net residential acres within the PUD district
shall be designated for and devoted to common open space.
2.
Usability of open space. At least 70 percent of the total common open space required must be usable. Usable, for
purposes of these regulations, is defined as that portion of the total open space required that complies with each
and every one of the following criteria:
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
518/543
i.
Dimension. Each and every parcel or portion of a parcel that is designated as usable shall not contain less than
10,000 square feet and not less than 60 feet in its smallest dimension. Furthermore, the overall shape should be
sufficiently geometric to be functionally usable.
ii.
Physical surface characteristics. Bodies of water or stream beds can account for not more than 40 percent of the
total required open space; provided, however, that not more than 20 percent of the required usable open space is
occupied by bodies of water or stream areas. At least 70 percent of the required usable open space shall have an
overall finished grade not to exceed ten percent.
iii.
Location. Usable open space should be distributed more or less equitably throughout the PUD district in
relationship to the number and types of dwelling units intended to be served by the common open space. All lots
or parcels designated for residential purposes that are part of a homeowners' association enjoying common open
spaces within the PUD shall be located not more than 1,000 feet from at least one parcel of usable open space;
provided, however, that for residential lots designated for single-family detached dwellings that contain at least
6,000 square feet per lot there shall be no distance requirement to the open space.
iv.
Physical improvements allowed. Only recreational facilities or structures and their accessory uses shall be
located in any usable open space areas. Walks, driveways and similar pathways are permitted and parking
facilities may be included where such parking areas are associated with and accessory to recreational facilities or
structures.
v.
Natural amenities. Developers are encouraged to include as part of the open space such areas that have unique or
unusual natural assets including heavy tree growth, ravines and natural rock outcroppings. However, not more
than 30 percent of the required usable open space can be left in a natural condition where such natural condition
of the area would prevent active recreational activities.
3.
Preservation of open space. Adequate guarantees must be provided that the common open space areas as
contained in the plan for the PUD district are preserved and maintained for those purposes only. A homeowners'
association shall be required, if other arrangements satisfactory to the planning commission have not been made,
for improving, operating and maintaining all such common open space areas. At the time the final plan and plat
is submitted, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the homeowners' association shall be reviewed and
approved by the planning commission. Additionally, the restrictive covenants which run with the land must be
submitted and include similar provisions to preserve all open space areas.
(e)
Procedure for obtaining PUD zoning. A three-step review procedure is required for obtaining PUD zoning and
final approval of the final plan and plat. The first step involves a preapplication plan and conference which is
designed to provide information to the local government of the developer's intention with respect to the nature
and scope of the proposed PUD district and to allow the developer to be informed of the city's regulations and
policies concerning development alternatives for the area. The second step involves submission of a formal
application for rezoning of the area to a PUD district and simultaneous submission of a preliminary plat in
accordance with the city subdivision rules and regulations. The last step involves submission of the final
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
519/543
development plan and plat for approval and recording prior to commencing building construction. These steps
are outlined below with respect to the procedure followed and submission requirements at each step:
(1)
Preapplication plan and conference.
a.
Procedure.
1.
A preapplication plan shall be submitted to the city planning commission for review of the area and proposed
uses relative to the compatibility of a planned unit development project with existing development in the
surrounding area and the comprehensive development plan of the city.
2.
Each applicant shall confer with the director of planning, the subdivision committee of the planning commission
and interested department heads in connection with the preparation of the planned unit development application.
It shall be the responsibility of the planning director to contact and invite these department heads to a joint
meeting. The general outlines of the proposal, evidenced schematically by the preapplication plan and such other
information as may be desired, is to be considered before submission of the planned unit development
application.
3.
Upon review of the site plan and general area, and following completion of the preapplication conference, the
department of planning shall furnish the applicant with written comments regarding the conference, including
appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to preparing the components of the planned
unit development application.
b.
Submission requirements. At the time of requesting a preapplication conference, the applicant shall submit a site
plan and such other narrative or graphic information the applicant deems pertinent to the city's initial review and
evaluation of the potential of the planned unit development district proposed. The preapplication plan shall
include the following:
1.
Boundaries of the property involved;
2.
Existing zoning of the area and zoning of adjoining properties;
3.
Existing roadways, easements and waterways;
4.
Indication of availability of all utilities;
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
520/543
5.
General plan of development at a level of detail sufficient to indicate to the city the nature and scope of the
project as to its magnitude in terms of approximate number and types of dwelling units, location and extent of
nonresidential elements, proposed locations of major open space areas, and major circulation facilities.
(2)
Zoning application and preliminary plat.
a.
Application. After receiving written comments from the department of planning following the preapplication
conference, the applicant may proceed in preparing a formal application for a planned unit development to the
city planning commission. The application shall consist of a simultaneous submission of a preliminary plat and a
rezoning application. The preliminary plat shall conform to all requirements contained in the city subdivision
regulations with the exception of certain design requirements regarding lots, setbacks, etc., that are specifically
exempted or modified by the provisions of this section. The application shall be processed following the
procedure for a change of zone district boundary as outlined in this chapter.

The topography of the project area with contour intervals as determined by the planning director shall be
included.
6.
A general land use development plan of the area shall be included indicating the location of different land uses,
dwellings by types and numbers, areas designated for commercial uses and other nonresidential uses, and areas
proposed for open space and recreational use. For all residential areas, the site plan shall clearly indicate the type
and number of dwellings to be located per parcel, lot or block in accordance with the preliminary plat. For all
commercial or other nonresidential uses, the areas shall clearly be indicated in accordance with lots, parcels or
blocks and each such parcel shall indicate the type of building proposed, number of stories and gross square
footage to be included on each parcel. The boundaries of all open space areas shall be clearly indicated along
with the form of proposed ownership, that is, by homeowners' association or public park or other legal entity,
and, in such case where more than one homeowners' association is being created, documentation shall be clearly
submitted as to which areas will have automatic membership into said associations. This requirement, however,
shall not be interpreted as requiring a detailed site development plan which includes the exact boundaries and
locations of all structures proposed for construction.

Amendments to the preliminary plan.
a.
At the time a final plan is submitted for review, it shall be determined whether or not any amendments have been
made to the approved preliminary plan. If amendments have been made then a determination shall be required as
to whether or not said amendments constitute a major or minor plan change. Modifications from the previously
approved preliminary plan shall be deemed to be minor plan changes if any and all modifications by the
applicant of the plan do not:
1.
Vary the total number of dwelling units by more than five percent;
2.
Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space or the substantial relocation of such area or
areas;
3.
Increase by more than five percent the floor area proposed for any nonresidential use; and
4.
Substantially change the location of any nonresidential areas as shown on the preliminary plan.
Additionally, modifications in the location design of minor streets, culs-de-sac, alleys or facilities for water and
for disposal of stormwater and sanitary sewage shall not be considered as major modifications.
b.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, the planning commission may not permit changes beyond the
maximum or minimum requirements set forth in this section.
c.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
523/543
All other changes in the planned unit, including changes in the site plan and the development schedule, must be
made under the procedures that are applicable to the initial approval of a planned unit.
(2)
Amendments to final development plan. The final development plan as submitted and approved may be amended
in accordance with the following procedure. Minor changes may be authorized by the planning director, if
required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final development program was
approved. No change authorized by the planning director under this section, however, may either increase the
total area devoted to any and all nonresidential uses, or decrease the amount of area devoted to common open
space, or increase the total number of dwelling units located on any lot, block or parcel as approved in the final
development plan. Notwithstanding any of these conditions, the planning director may not permit changes
beyond the minimum or maximum requirements set forth in this section. All other changes in the planned unit,
including changes in the site plan or the development schedule, must be made under the procedures that are
applicable to the initial approval of a planned unit development.
(g)
Administration and enforcement.
(1)
Review standards. The department of planning shall investigate and ascertain that the plans for a planned unit
development meet the following conditions:
a.
That the tract of land for the entire project comprises not less than three acres.
b.
That the project is in conformity with the requirements and standards of development of the planned unit
development district and is consistent with the intent and purpose of this section.
c.
That the proposed project constitutes an environment of sustained desirability and stability and that it is in
harmony with the character of the surrounding neighborhood.
d.
That the property adjacent to the proposed development will not be adversely affected.
(2)
Recorded plat and plot plan required. The proposed development shall follow all applicable procedures,
standards, regulations and laws governing the subdivision of land. No zoning certificate for any structure shall
be issued until a final plat of the proposed development or part thereof is approved and recorded and an
approved plat plan has been submitted in accordance with section 118-38(d) of this chapter.
(3)
Phasing and development schedule.
a.
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
524/543
The applicant is permitted to construct the planned unit development in more than one phase or stage of
construction. In such cases, the applicant shall clearly indicate on the site plan map the boundaries of each
proposed phase. If the sequence of construction of various portions of the development is to occur in phases or
stages, then the open space and/or recreational facilities must be developed or committed thereto in proportion to
the number of dwelling units intended to be developed during any given stage of construction as approved by the
planning commission. Compliance with this provision, however, will be calculated in a cumulative manner, i.e.,
the open space required in any successive phase of development shall equal or exceed the requirement of the
total number of units constructed through all phases.
b.
Additionally, the applicant shall submit a schedule of construction for the project or for each phase within the
project indicating the sequence of development according to residential type and other nonresidential
construction within the project. Upon adoption of the schedule of construction, the building inspector shall be
responsible for enforcing this schedule. If he determines that the rate of construction of residential units or
nonresidential structures differs from the construction schedule, he shall so notify the developer in writing;
thereafter the building inspector may issue such orders to the developer as he sees fit, and upon continued
violation of this subsection may suspend the developer from further construction of dwelling units or
nonresidential structures until compliance is achieved.
(4)
Guarantee of completion. Before approval of the final development plan, the planning commission shall require
a contract with safeguards satisfactory to the commission guaranteeing completion of the development plan for
any single phase in a period to be specified by the commission, but which period shall not exceed five years
unless extended by the commission.

Sec. 117-150. - Floodprone district.
(a)
Description of district. The floodprone district is composed of lands which have high water tables, have
improper drainage, or are subject to periodic overflow. The district is established to protect the public health and
to reduce the financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and individuals, which may
result from the improper use of such lands. The boundaries of these lands are established by the planning
commission based on data received from the city engineer, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Soil
Conservation Service. In this district, it is felt that the problems of water table, improper drainage and periodic
overflow can be solved through natural or manmade improvements, and that once these changes have been made
and it can be demonstrated beyond doubt that the condition no longer exists, and that all drainage, sewer and
other utility lines will operate efficiently under all conditions, and that all structures erected thereon will comply
with all provisions of the building or other codes, then the district may be reclassified. Such determination and
reclassification shall be made by the planning commission in consultation with the city engineer and such other
agencies as may be interested in the reclassification of the said lands and the improvements proposed thereon,
and shall be subject to the amending procedures set forth in this chapter. In order to assist in the development of
the overall plan for the city and to encourage the proper use of land, the commission may establish the type of
district for which the lands shall be deemed suitable upon correction of the basic problem, and such floodprone
designation shall be followed by the designation of the appropriate district. This designation shall not give the
right to develop such lands for the use, but shall only be a guide to the owner and the commission on the most
appropriate use for the reclaimed land.
(b)
8/16/2019 North Little Rock, AR Code of Ordinances
528/543
Limitation of external effects of uses. Within not more than two years from the date on which this chapter is
