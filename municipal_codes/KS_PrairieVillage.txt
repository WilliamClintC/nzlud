1-212. CODE OF ETHICS.
A. Purpose. To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct.
B. Scope. This policy applies to officials and employees.
C Policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels
or governmental structures; that public office not be used for personal gain;
and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a code of ethics for all
officials and employees
The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of
conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions
that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing
disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other
interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code
of ethics are in the best interests of the city. This code of ethics shall not apply
to persons who serve only as members of boards, committees, or
commissions.
(1) Responsibilities of Public Office. Public officials and employees are
agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They
are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the
Constitution of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation,
state, and city and thus to foster respect for all government. They are
bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality
and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal
consideration, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary
concern. The conduct in both official and private affairs should be above
reproach.
(2) Dedicated Service.
(a) All officials and employees of the city should be loyal to the objectives
expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain
those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should
adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the
standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.
(b) Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach
the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full
cooperation with other public officials and employees unless
prohibited from so doing by law or by officially recognized
confidentiality of their work.
D. Fair and Equal Treatment. No official or employee shall grant any special
consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available
to every other citizen, other than those established by council as employee fringe
benefits.
E. Conflict of Interest.
(1) No councilmember or other official or employee, whether paid or unpaid,
shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or
other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the
1-13
proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest or would tend
to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the
performance of his or her official duties.
(2) Substantial Interest in Any Business. No councilmember or other official
or employee shall act on any matter which will affect any business in which
he or she holds a substantial (as defined in K.S.A. 75-4301) interest
unless a written report of the nature of such interest has been filed with
the county clerk.
(3) Participation in a City Contract. No councilmember or other official shall
make or participate in the making of any contract by the city with any
person or business by which he or she is employed or in whose business
he or she has a substantial interest. Any official or employee does not
participate in the making of a contract if he or she abstains from any action
in regard to the contact. This rule does not apply (i) if the contract is let
after the competitive bidding has been advertised for by public notice, or
(ii) when a contact is for property or services for which the price or rate is
fixed by law.
(4) Incompatible Employment - No councilmember or other official or
employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render
services for private interests when such employment or service is
incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would
tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the
performance of his or her official duties, unless otherwise permitted by law
and unless disclosure is made as provided in this code.
(5) Disclosure of Confidential Information - No councilmember or other
official or employee, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose
confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs
of the city. Nor shall he or she use such information to advance the
financial or other private interest of himself, herself or others. When a
question arises about classification of information, the departmental
supervisor and/or the city attorney shall make the determination.
(6) Gifts and Favors. No councilmember or other official or employee shall
accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing or
promise, from any person, firm, or corporation which to his or her
knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever
in business dealings with the city; nor shall any such official or employee
(a) accept any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to influence him
or her in the discharge of his or her duties or (b) grant in the discharge of
his or her duties any improper favor, service, or thing of value. The
prohibition against gifts or favors shall not apply to: (a) an occasional
nonpecuniary gift, of only nominal value or (b) an award publicly
presented in recognition of public service or (c) any gift which would have
been offered or given to him or her if not an official or employee.
(7) Late Case Interest. No public officer or employee shall, after the
termination of service or employment with the city, appear before any
board, commission, committee or agency of the city in relation to any
case, proceeding or application in which he or she personally participated
during the period of his or her service or employment, or which was under
1-14
his or her active consideration. This does not preclude ex-employees
from testifying in court on city-related matters.
F. Political Activity. Employees are encouraged to vote in any and all elections
for which they are eligible; however, to safeguard the city's policy of employment
and advancement on the basis of merit and qualifications, employees are prohibited
from participating in the election campaign of any candidate for city office or from
holding any office in any political party organization “within the city” which may
influence the election of any city official.
No official or employee, whether elected or appointed, shall promise an appointment
to any municipal position as a reward for any political activity.
G. Misuse of City Property. No city official or employee shall request or permit
the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal
convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public
generally or are provided as municipal policy for the use of such official or employee
in the conduct of official business.
H. Applicability of Code. When a councilmember or other official or employee has
doubt as to the interpretation or the applicability of a provision of this code to a
particular situation, he/she should apply in writing to the policy/services committee
for an advisory opinion and be guided by that opinion when given. Any official,
employee or citizen shall have the opportunity to present his or her interpretation of
the facts at issue and of the applicable provision(s) of the code before such advisory
decision is made. This code shall be operative in all instances covered by its
provisions except when superseded by an applicable statutory or charter provision
and statutory or charter action is mandatory, or when the application of a statutory
or charter provision is discretionary but determined to be more appropriate or
desirable.
I. Distribution of Code of Ethics. The city clerk shall cause a copy of this code of
ethics to be distributed to every public officer and employee of the city within 30
days after enactment of this code. Each public officer and employee elected,
appointed or employed thereafter, shall furnish a copy.
J. Enforcement of Code. Any alleged violation by a public official or employee
shall be brought to the attention of the policy/services committee by a written
complaint duly signed by a complaining party. The policy/services committee shall
investigate the written complaint. The policy/services committee shall adopt its own
rules for studying and investigating complaints. After investigating the complaint, the
policy/services committee shall make recommendations in writing to the mayor and
the department head of the employee. The mayor and department head shall take
whatever action they deem appropriate. In the case of employees, action shall be
based upon established employment policies of the city, including dismissal where
appropriate. On the part of public officials, action, if any, shall either be public censor
or ouster, provided that all action be in accordance with the applicable statutes of
the State of Kansas.

of any enactment of the legislature as referred to in Section 5 of Article 12 of the
constitution of Kansas.
Ordinance as used in this code, means any ordinance other than a charter
ordinance. (Code 1973, 2.04.020)
1-902. CHARTER ORDINANCE ORDINANCES; ADOPTION; RECORDING. Every
charter ordinance shall be so titled, shall designate specifically the enactment of the
legislature or part thereof made inapplicable to the city by the adoption of such
ordinance and contain the substitute and additional provisions, if any, and shall
require a two-thirds vote of the members-elect of the governing body of such city.
Every charter ordinance shall be published once each week for two consecutive
weeks in the official city newspaper or, if there is none, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city.
No charter ordinance shall take effect until 60 days after its final publication. If within
60 days of its final publication a petition signed by a number of electors of the city
equal to not less than 10 percent of the number of electors who voted at the last
preceding regular city election shall be filed in the office of the city clerk demanding
that such ordinance be submitted to a vote of the electors, it shall not take effect
until submitted to a referendum and approved by a majority of the electors voting
thereon. An election, if called, shall be called within 30 days and held within 90 days
after the filing of the petition. The city council shall pass an ordinance calling the
election and fixing the date on which ordinance shall be published once each week
for three consecutive weeks in the official city newspaper or, if there is none, in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city, and the election shall be conducted as
elections for officers and by the officers handling such elections. The proposition
shall be: “Shall Charter Ordinance No. ____, entitled (title of ordinance) take
effect?” The governing body may submit any charter ordinance to a referendum
without petition by the same publication of the charter ordinance and the same
publication of the ordinance calling the election as for ordinances upon petition and
such charter ordinance shall then become effective when approved by a majority of
the electors voting thereon. Each charter ordinance becoming effective shall be
recorded by the clerk in a book maintained for that purpose with a statement of the
manner of adoption and a certified copy shall be filed with the secretary of state,
who shall keep an index of the same.
Each charter ordinance enacted shall control and prevail over any prior or
subsequent act of the governing body of the city and may be repealed or amended
only by charter ordinance or by enactments of the legislature applicable to all cities.

to set a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the animal in
question should be declared potentially dangerous, dangerous or vicious.

serves as the evidentiary basis to support a finding of probable cause shall be
made by declaration under penalty of perjury by the complainant in the manner
provided by K.S.A. 53-601, and shall be attached to the petition. The Municipal
Court, upon the finding of probable cause, shall notify the person responsible for
the animal, personally or by certified mail, and the animal control officer or law
enforcement officer and City Prosecutor, by best means possible, that a hearing
will be held within fourteen (14) days, at which time the person responsible may
present evidence to the Municipal Court as to why the animal should not be
declared potentially dangerous, dangerous or vicious.
2. The failure of the person responsible to attend or participate in the hearing shall
not prevent the Municipal Court from hearing evidence in the matter and making
a determination whether the animal is potentially dangerous, dangerous or
vicious as alleged, or from entering further orders pursuant to such finding. The
hearing shall be informal and shall be open to the public.
3. The Municipal Court, after considering the evidence, may issue its determination
and order declaring the animal to be potentially dangerous, dangerous or vicious
based upon such evidence. The order shall be delivered to the person
responsible either personally or by first class mail. If a determination is made that
the animal is potentially dangerous, dangerous or vicious, the person responsible
shall comply with the provisions of this Chapter as directed by the Municipal
Court in accordance with a time table established by the Municipal Court, within
thirty (30) days after the date of the determination. If the person responsible for
the animal contests the determination, he or she may within ten (10) days,
exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of such determination appeal to
the district court.

appeals taken, the animal is not restrained, and the animal control officer or law
enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the animal in question
may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals,
the animal control officer or law enforcement officer may seize and impound the
animal pending the aforesaid Municipal Court determination and/or the
determination in any appeals taken. Upon the Municipal Court's determination
that the impounded animal is potentially dangerous, dangerous or vicious, the
person responsible for the animal shall be liable to the City for the costs and
expenses of impounding such animal.
b) Control of Potentially Dangerous and Dangerous Cats or Dogs. If the Municipal Court
determines that an animal is potentially dangerous or dangerous, the person responsible

person responsible where the animal has been moved. The Municipal Court shall notify
the receiving jurisdiction that the animal has been determined to be a vicious animal.
The animal shall not be returned to the City limits after removal. It shall be unlawful for
the person responsible for a vicious animal to maintain such animal in violation of the

review hearing is filed, the Municipal court shall notify the person responsible for the
animal, personally or by certified mail, and the animal control officer or law enforcement
officer and City Prosecutor, by best means possible, that a hearing will be held within
fourteen (14) days, at which time the person responsible must provide evidence that the
animal is no longer potentially dangerous or dangerous due to the animal's age,
neutering, environment, completion of obedience training that includes modification of
aggressive behavior, or other factors. The City Prosecutor may present evidence as
well. The hearing shall be informal and shall be open to the public. If the Municipal
Court finds sufficient evidence that the animal's behavior has changed, the Municipal
Court may rescind that potentially dangerous or dangerous animal designation. (Ord.

for the animal’s board during the period of impoundment, the animal shall be
permitted to remain confined in the residence or enclosed yard of the person
responsible; provided no animal shall be allowed to remain on the property of the
person responsible therefor under this section unless such person signs a written
agreement to keep the animal on the property in confinement for the period
specified in subsection (a) of this section and further agrees to allow the animal
to be examined periodically to determine its physical condition during the
confinement period. At the end of the observation period, the animal control
officer may require that a licensed veterinarian examine the animal and furnish
written notification to the animal control officer regarding the animal’s health. All
costs associated with the exam are the responsibility of the person responsible. If
the person responsible for such animal is unwilling to sign such an agreement,

communication or first class mail.
(d) If a recipient of an Order of Abatement makes a written request for a
hearing within the 10 day period, a hearing shall be immediately
scheduled before the Governing Body or its designated representative. At
such hearing, all relevant parties, interest holders and City officials shall
be allowed to present evidence concerning the status of the property and

Abatement. In making such a determination the Governing Body or its
designated representative shall describe the relevant facts and specific
statute or code provisions being relied upon and state any such other
stipulations, methods of removal and abatement of orders as deemed
necessary. If the Order of Abatement is either modified or upheld, the
property owner, owner’s agent or tenant shall be given a reasonable time
to remove and abate the nuisance, not to exceed 10 days.
(e) If an authorized public officer determines that a violation of this section
exists, he or she may issue a notice to appear in municipal court for such
violation. No other procedures are required as a prerequisite to the
issuance of a notice to appear. The imposition of any removal and

return receipt requested, stating the costs of such removal and
abatement incurred by the City; provided, any notice served on a tenant
shall also be served on the owner or owner’s agent.
The costs shall include the City’s cost of providing the notice, including
any postage. The recipient shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of
such notice to make full payment. The Notice of Costs shall state:

Clerk at the time of certifying other City taxes, shall certify the unpaid
portion of the costs, and the County Clerk shall extend the same on the
tax roll of the county against the property, and it shall be collected by the
County Treasurer and paid to the City as other City taxes are collected

116.6 ENFORCEMENT AGAINST UNSAFE STRUCTURES; DESIGNATION OF
OFFICER; NOTICE TO APPEAR; HEARING; RESOLUTION.
(a) The Building Official shall be charged with the administration and
enforcement of this section as it concerns unsafe structures. The
Building Official shall authorize the investigation of violations of this
section by his or her designated agents. If it is determined that a
violation of this section exists, then the Building Official or his or her
designated agent shall file a written report with the Governing Body of the
City describing the situation, its location, and the circumstances which
Table of Contents Chapter Index
4-17
support the determination that the structure is unsafe. The Governing
Body shall then fix a time and place at which the owner, representative,
tenant, or lienholders of record may appear and show cause why such
structure should not be condemned and ordered repaired or demolished.
Such resolution shall be published once each week for two consecutive
weeks on the same day of each week. At least 30 days shall elapse
between the last publication and the date set for the hearing. A copy of
the resolution shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested,
within 3 days after its first publication to each such owner, representative,
tenant or lienholder of record, as can reasonably be determined, at the
last known place of residence, and shall be marked, deliver to addressee
only.
(b) On the hearing date fixed by the Governing Body’s resolution all relevant
parties, interest holders and relevant city officials shall be allowed to
present evidence concerning the status of the property. The Governing
Body shall subsequently make findings by resolution. If the Governing
Body finds that such structure is unsafe or dangerous, such resolution
shall direct the structure to be repaired or removed and the premises
made safe and secure. Such resolution shall be published once in the
official city newspaper and a copy mailed to the owners, representatives,
tenants or lienholders of record by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The resolution shall affix a reasonable time within which the repair or
removal of the structure shall be commenced and a statement that if the
owner of such structure fails to commence the repair or removal of such
structure within the time stated, or fails to diligently commence such
action until the work is completed, the Governing Body will cause the
structure to be razed and removed.
(c) If an authorized agent determines that a violation of this section exists, he
or she may issue a notice to appear in municipal court for such violations.
No other procedures are required as a prerequisite to the issuance of a
notice to appear.
116.7 EXCAVATION FILL. It shall be the duty of the property owner, representative,
or the tenant, upon removal of a structure, to fill any basement, after removing all
concrete footings and foundation walls, or other excavation located upon the
premises and take any other action necessary to leave such premises in a safe
condition including grading and seeding or sodding of the area, removal of dirt or
mud from roads, streets, alleys, or sidewalks, to allow for proper drainage of the site,
and to remove any and all refuse, trash, debris, brush and limbs, or materials from
the site.
116.8 REMOVAL OF UNSAFE STRUCTURES; SALVAGE; SALE; ASSESSMENT
AND COLLECTION OF COSTS; PROCEDURE.
(a) If the owner of any structure has failed to commence the repair or removal
of such structure within the time stated in the resolution, or has failed to
diligently prosecute the same thereafter, the City may proceed to raze and
remove such structure, make the premises safe and secure, or let same to
contract. The City shall keep an account of the costs for such work and
may sell the salvage from such structure and apply the proceeds or any
necessary portion thereof to pay the cost of removing such structure and
Table of Contents Chapter Index
4-18
making the premises safe and secure. All moneys in excess of that
necessary to pay such costs after the payment of all costs, shall be paid to
the owner of the premises upon which the structure was located.
(b) The City shall give notice to the owner of such structure by certified mail,
return receipt requested, of the total cost incurred by the City in removing
such structure and making the premises safe and secure. Such notice
also shall state that payment of such costs is due and payable within 30
days following receipt of such notice. If the cost is not paid within the 30
day period and if there is no salvageable material or if moneys received
from the sale of salvage or from the proceeds of any insurance policy in
which the City has created a lien pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3901 et seq., and
amendments thereto, are insufficient to pay the cost of such work, the
balance shall be collected in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-1, 115, as
amended, but only until the full cost and applicable interest has been paid
in full. Whenever any structure is removed from any premises under the
provisions of this section, the City Clerk shall certify to the County
Appraiser that such structure, describing the same, has been removed.
(c) If there is no salvageable material, or if the moneys received from the sale
of salvage or from the proceeds of any insurance policy in which the City
has created a lien pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3901 et seq., and amendments
thereto, are insufficient to pay the costs of the work, such costs or any
portion thereof in excess of that received from the sale of salvage or any
insurance proceeds may be financed, until the costs are paid out of the
general fund or by the issuance of no-fund warrants. Whenever no-fund
warrants are issued under the authority of this act, the Governing Body of
such City shall make a tax levy at the first tax levying period for the
purpose of paying such warrants and the interest thereon. All such tax
levies shall be in addition to all other levies authorized or limited by law
and shall not be subject to the aggregate tax levy prescribed in Article 19
of Chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
thereto. Such warrants shall be issued, registered, redeemed and bear
interest in the manner and in the form prescribed by K.S.A. 79-2940, and
amendments thereto, except they shall not bear the notation required by
that section and may be issued without the approval of the State Board of
Tax Appeals. All moneys received from special assessments levied under
the provisions of this section or from an action under K.S.A. 12-1, 115, as
amended, when and if paid, shall be placed in the general fund of the City.
116.9 PROOF OF REPAIRING OR REBUILDING.
In lieu of the payment of proceeds, the insured may present satisfactory proof to the
Building Official that the insured has or will remove debris and repair, rebuild or
otherwise make the premises safe and secure. Upon presentation of such sufficient
evidence, the Building Official along with the City Clerk shall certify that adequate
proof of repairing or rebuilding has been given and that the payment of insurance
proceeds to the City shall not be paid, subject to any lien created by the City should
the insured fail to rebuild, repair, or secure the property as presented. The insured
shall be responsible for presenting such certificate to the insurer. The insured, in
seeking such certificate, shall present a timetable showing when repairs or rebuilding
will be completed; render architectural or engineering plans, subject to approval by
the Building Official, showing the method, manner and materials to be used in
Table of Contents Chapter Index
4-19
repairing or rebuilding; and any other evidence deemed necessary by the Building
Official to demonstrate that the repairs or rebuilding will be completed in a timely and
lawful manner. Failure of the insured to comply with the certificate shall result in the
institution of proceedings for abatement.
116.10 CITY NOT PARTY TO INSURANCE CONTRACT.
This section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, nor is the
insurer liable to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise
payable under its insurance policy.
116.11 FAILURE TO PAY INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR TO OBTAIN A
CERTIFICATE IN LIEU OF PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS.
It is unlawful for any person to fail to provide the payment of insurance proceeds as
required by this section unless a certificate in lieu of payment of proceeds has been
obtained through the City.
116.12 IMMEDIATE HAZARDS.
In the event the public officer under this section determines that a nuisance or unsafe
structure exists which creates an immediate hazard, then the City shall proceed,
without delay, to take steps to abate the situation and without prior notice to or
hearing of the owner, representative, or tenant. The cost of such action shall be
assessed as set forth in K.S.A 12-1, 115, as amended.
116.13 RIGHT OF ENTRY; UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE; PENALTY.

to pursue assessment or collection of costs as stated in this article, or by
other laws.
(c) Each day that any violation shall continue shall constitute a separate
offense.

customers, etc.).
(e) Nothing in this article shall:
(1) prohibit a fraternal or social association/corporation in fact not open to the public,

discrimination and retaliation.

(d) Upon receipt of a complete complaint, the investigator shall notify the respondent(s) of
the complaint, providing sufficient details related to the complaint so the respondent(s)

(e) Following the conclusion of the answer period, the investigator may initiate an
investigation period, requesting that the complainant and/or respondent(s) provide

of police and shall be enforced as in all cases of city ordinances. This investigation
period shall be concluded within sixty (60) days of the investigator’s last request for
information, unless the investigator notifies the complainant and the respondent(s) in
writing of the need for additional time and reason(s) therefore.
(f) Within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the investigation period, the investigator will
review all evidence received during the investigation and make a determination whether

practice. The investigator will maintain all evidence received during the investigation for
a period of two (2) years after the deadline for appeal or completion of appeal,
whichever is later.
(g) If the investigator finds that probable cause does not exist, then the investigator shall
notify the complainant and the respondent(s), and no further action shall be taken by
the city. The complainant may appeal the investigator’s determination to the District
Court of Johnson County, Kansas, in accordance with K.S.A. 60-2101(d), and
amendments thereto. Within thirty (30) days of service of the notice of appeal pursuant
to K.S.A. 60-2101(d), or within further time allowed by the court or by other provision of
law, the city shall transmit to the court a certified copy of the investigator’s written
determination and a certified copy of all evidence received by the investigator during
the investigation.
(h) If the investigator finds that probable causes exists that an unlawful discriminatory
practice was committed by respondent(s), the investigator shall not notify the
complainant and respondent(s) and request conciliation and settlement. If a party
refuses to participate in conciliation and settlement, or if a settlement agreement is not
executed within sixty (60) days of the date of the finding of probable cause, the matter
shall be referred to the hearing officer for a hearing. The investigator may extend the
time for signing a settlement agreement for good cause and with written notice to the
parties.
(i) If the investigator has determined that probable cause exists that the respondent(s)
committed an unlawful discriminatory practice against the complainant, and the
complaint could not be conciliated and settled within sixty (60) days of the date of
such determination (or the last day of any extension, whichever is later), the complaint
shall be set for a hearing before the hearing officer. The parties will be given at least
5-54
ten (10) days’ written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. At such hearing,
the parties shall be entitled to call witnesses and to present such other evidence as
appropriate. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures as
may be established by the hearing officer, but the rules of evidence used in courts of
law need not be strictly enforced. The hearing officer shall have the power to administer

proceeds of any insurance policy in which the City has created a lien pursuant to
K.S.A. 40-3901 et seq. and amendments thereto, are insufficient to pay the costs of
such work, the balance shall be collected in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-1,115

hour from any source in excess of the amount shown in Table 1 (section 8-
425) for the process weight allocated to such source.
B. The limitations established by subsection (a) of this section shall not require
the reduction of particulate matter concentration, based on the source gas
volume, below the concentration specified in Table 2 (section 8-426) for such
volume; provided that, for the purposes of this subsection the person
responsible for the emission may elect to substitute a volume determined
according to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section; and provided
further that the burden of showing the source gas volume or other volume
substitute therefore, including all the factors which determine such volume
and the methods of determining the computing such volume, shall be on the
person seeking to come within the provisions of this subsection.
C. Any volume of gases passing through and leaving an air pollution abatement
operation may be substitute for the source gas volume of the course
operation served by such air pollution abatement operation, for the purposes
of subsection (b) of this section; provided such air pollution abatement
operation emits no more than 40 percent of the weight of particulate matter
entering thereto; and provided further, that such substitute volume shall be
corrected to standard conditions and to a moisture standard conditions and to
a moisture content no greater than that of any gas stream entering such air
pollution abatement operation.

11-803. REMOVAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES. Whenever any person abandons a
vehicle (motorized or trailer) for a period in excess of 48 hours, the police
department, or its designated agent, may cause to have an approved commercial

after 48 hours from the time the sticker or placard was attached to the vehicle. The

Sec. 6, 2009)
11-804. NOTICE TO OWNER OF TOWED VEHICLE.
A. The police officer who has caused to have the approved commercial towing
service remove the vehicle, will make a reasonable attempt to ensure that the
owner or a responsible person of the towed vehicle or piece of equipment is
notified of the tow and release procedures. The approved commercial towing
service, at the time the towing service is provided, shall give written notice to
the driver, if available, of the vehicle being towed, that a fee will be charged for
storage of such vehicle. Failure by the approved commercial towing service to
give such written notice shall invalidate any lien established for such storage
fee.
B. If a tow has been completed by an approved commercial towing service at the
authorization of a police officer, and the registered owner has not recovered
the vehicle after seven days, the assigned dispatcher will notify the owner and
any lien holder known (by telephone or mail) of the whereabouts of the vehicle
and the procedures for release. If the vehicle has not been released after 30
days, the assigned dispatcher will mail a certified notification to the owner and
any lien holders known reiterating the release procedures. A copy of the letter
will be kept with the case file.
C. The commercial towing service that renders any recovery, transportation,
protection, storage, or safekeeping of any vehicle at the request of the police
officer, shall have a first and prior lien created on such vehicle. The commercial
11-33
towing service in possession of the vehicle is required by K.S.A. § 8-1103 to
send a notice to the owner of the vehicle, if known, within 15 days from the
rendering of any towing service stating that the vehicle is being held subject to
the satisfaction of the lien.
D. If an investigative hold has been placed on the vehicle, the vehicle may only be
released to the registered owner by one of the following authorities: the officer
who placed the hold; the investigator who processed the vehicle; the outside
agency that requested the hold; or a division commander of the police
department.
If an investigative hold has not been removed by the police officer who
caused the vehicle to be towed by an approved commercial towing service
within seven days, the assigned dispatcher will contact the officer and inquire
about the status of the hold. If the hold has not been released after 10 days,
the assigned dispatcher will notify the officer's supervisor.
E. If the owner of the towed motor vehicle, trailer, equipment, etc., does not claim
such property and pay the removal and storage charges incurred by the
commercial towing service within 45 calendar days, the commercial towing
service, before 60 days pass, shall request verification from the division of
vehicles as to the last registered owner and any lien holders. Within 10 calendar
days after receipt of such verification, the commercial towing service will notify
the registered owner and lien holder, as applicable, by registered mail that the
property towed is subject to public auction to the highest bidder within 15 days
from the date of the mailing of the notice. The commercial towing service shall
also use reasonable diligence in determining the title owner if the division of
vehicles is unable to verify the owner or if the vehicle is from a non-title state,
and shall inquire by mail of the office of the register of deeds of the county in
which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in the state, as to whether
there are any lien holders of record. Copies of any notices sent shall be filed
with the Johnson County Clerk by the commercial towing service, along with
an affidavit from the commercial towing service setting forth the claim and
actual expenses of notice, publication and sale.
(Ord. 1978, Sec. 2; Ord. 2129, Sec. II, 2006; Ord. 2169, Sec. 4, 2008)
11-805. PUBLIC NOTICE. After 15 days from the dates of mailing notice, the
commercial towing service shall publish a notice once a week for three consecutive
weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in Johnson County, Kansas. The notice
shall describe the property and/or motor vehicle by name of maker, model, vehicle
identification number, and owner, if known, stating that it has been towed and held
by the respective commercial towing service and will be sold at public auction to the
highest bidder for cash if the owner does not claim it within 10 days of the date of
the third publication of the notice and pay the removal and storage charges, and
publication costs incurred by the commercial towing service. Copies of the
publication shall be filed with the Johnson County Clerk by the commercial towing
service, along with the notices and affidavits described in section 11-804. (Ord.

11-1402. UNLAWFUL TO OPERATE WITHOUT A PERMIT. It shall be unlawful for any
person to use property for any neighborhood special event as defined in this article

the term “neighborhood special event” means temporary outdoor use of private
property in a district zoned residential, which
A. Is likely to or does in fact generate crowds of participants or visitors sufficient in
size to obstruct, delay or interfere with the safe and orderly movement of
pedestrian or vehicular traffic; and
B. Is likely to or does in fact create a condition in which the Police Department is
required to protect the public health and welfare by modifying the normal flow of
traffic and parking or by diverting police officers to the vicinity of the event in
order to regulate and enforce traffic, pedestrian safety and parking and to insure
that fire and police protection and ambulance service to the areas near such
neighborhood special events are not unduly interfered with or prevented.

forms provided by the Police Department, and shall be accompanied by the
following items, as applicable:
1. A letter from the applicant identifying the address of the property at which
the neighborhood special event shall be held, describing the event, the
hours of operation, the duration of the event, an estimate of the per diem

and
3. Any additional information deemed necessary by the City.
B. The applicant shall be either the owner or occupant of the property at which the
neighborhood special event shall be held. If the neighborhood special event will

writing to a single representative the authority to apply for a special permit.
C. A complete application shall be made at least two (2) weeks prior to the
commencement date of a neighborhood special event.
Recognizing that an event may not initially fall within the definition of
“neighborhood special event” set forth in Section 11-1403, or that an owner or
occupant may reasonably believe that a planned event will not fall within the
definition of “neighborhood special event” set forth in Section 11-1403, this
article will also be complied with if, within five (5) business days after an event
does in fact meet the definition of “neighborhood special event” set forth in
Section 11-1403, an application is made.
Based upon the criteria set forth in subsection D below, the Police Department
shall determine whether to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the permit
within one (1) week after the application is received.
The Police Department shall have the authority to order any neighborhood
special event which has commenced without a neighborhood special event
permit to cease pending the processing of a valid application in order to protect
the public safety and welfare.
D. The Police Department may deny a neighborhood special event permit if it
determines that there are no conditions which can be imposed which will protect
the public safety and welfare.
The Police Department may grant a neighborhood special event permit with
conditions deemed necessary to protect the public safety and welfare, including,
but not limited to:
(i) the placement by the Public Works department of signs, including limited
turning signs, one way traffic signs, protected pedestrian crossing signs,
11-57
and restricted parking signs, in order to regulate traffic flow, parking, and
pedestrian safety,
(ii) the presence of police officers during some or all of the neighborhood
special event operating times in order to regulate and enforce traffic,
pedestrian safety and parking and to insure that fire and police protection
and ambulance service to the areas near such neighborhood special
event are not unduly interfered with or prevented,
(iii) limits on the hours of operation in order to prevent a diversion of police
from normal services.
If the Police Department determines that signage or police presence is required,
or if the City provides other services or equipment at the request of the applicant,
the applicant shall be required to reimburse the City for the costs of such
signage, equipment or services in accordance with section 11-1407 hereof.
(Ord. 2262, Sec. 1, 2012)
11-1407. PAYMENTS. If costs are to be reimbursed to the City pursuant to section 11-

neighborhood special event permit. If the costs are less than the estimated cost
advance, the City shall refund the difference to the applicant within thirty (30) days
of the termination of the neighborhood special event. If the costs are more than the
estimated cost advance, the City shall so notify the applicant who is obligated to pay
such excess costs within thirty (30) days of demand therefor. (Ord. 2262, Sec. 1,
2012)
11-1408. DENIAL OF A NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT APPLICATION;
APPEALS FROM CONDITIONS OR DENIALS. If the Police Department
disapproves any application, it shall give the reasons therefore in writing, file same
with the City Clerk and mail or deliver a copy to the applicant. The applicant may
appeal such disapproval by filing a written notice thereof with the City Clerk within
15 days after the Police Department files the statement of reasons for the
disapproval. A hearing on such appeal shall be held by the Governing Body of the
City no more than fourteen (14) days after the applicant files such notice of appeal.
The Governing Body, after a hearing, may reverse or affirm the decision of the Police
Department by a majority vote. Applicant may bring an action in the District Court
of Johnson County to determine the reasonableness of any such decision. Such
appeals must be filed in the District Court within thirty (30) calendar days after the
date that the decision of the Governing Body was made. (Ord. 2262, Sec. 1, 2012)
11-1409. REVOCATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIAL EVENT PERMIT.

entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the service provider.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-510. USE OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.
A. The ROW-user's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to
the City's use or occupation of the right-of-way. Without limitation of its rights,
the City expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now
and hereafter vested in or granted to the City.
B. The ROW-user shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner that
does not interfere with a Public Improvement and does not compromise the
public health, safety, or welfare, as reasonably determined by the City.
Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate
clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted
13-16
by such public improvement as defined in the City's “Manual of Infrastructure
Standards” available in the office of the Public Works Director. Such
Standards shall be competitively neutral and not unreasonable or
discriminatory. (Ord. 2354, Sec 2, 2016)
C. The ROW-users shall consider any request made by the City concerning
placement of facilities in private easements in order to limit or eliminate future
street improvement relocation expenses.
D. All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or interfere with any
pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems, or other structures or public
improvements already installed. In addition, the ROW-user shall, in doing
work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be practicable,
disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of right-of-way or other public
lands of the City.
E. All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with
the use of right-of-way and public lands. The City, through its Public Works
Director, shall have the right to consult and review the location, design and
nature of the facility prior to its being installed.
F. All newly-constructed facilities shall be located underground. The ROW-user
shall comply with all requirements of the City relating to underground
facilities. This requirement may be waived by the Public Works Director at
his or her discretion for safety concerns, or some other good cause under the
condition that does not cause discrimination among ROW-users. If this
requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the Public
Works Director, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location,
height, breakaway design, and clear zones. Provided, however, the height of
a facility will not exceed, or cause any existing facility to exceed, the lesser of:
(a) thirty-five (35) feet for residential or collector streets or forty-five (45) feet
for arterial streets; and
(b) sixty-six (66) inches about the height of existing street light poles along
the right-of-way surrounding the facility.
Above ground facilities shall comply with the Manual of Infrastructure
Standards and all applicable zoning regulations, including but not limited to
design, size, height, setbacks, screening and landscaping, and illumination,
and be located in a manner that does not compromise the public health,
safety, or welfare. No newly-constructed above ground facilities shall be
located directly in front of any single-family home (or in front of where a
single-family home could be constructed, in the case of a vacant lot),
provided that if the Public Works Director deems it necessary or appropriate,
such facilities may be located in the front yard, at or along the property line
between two adjacent properties. (Ord. 2354, Sec 2, 2016)
G. The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other ROW-users
without their permission. If and when the City requires or negotiates to have a
service provider cease using its existing poles and to relocate its facilities
underground, all other service providers using the same poles shall also
relocate their facilities underground at the same time, except transmission
equipment, as defined in 47 CFR 1.40001. Provided, any such relocations
shall be subject to the appeal process contained in Section 13-528, as
amended. (Ord. 2354, Sec 2, 2016).
13-17
H. The Public Works Director may assign specific corridors within the right-ofway,
or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facility that is currently or, pursuant to current technology, the Public Works
Director expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All right-ofway
permits issued by Public Works Director shall indicate the proper corridor
for the ROW-user's facilities. Any ROW-user whose facilities are currently in
the right-of-way in a position at a variance with the designated corridors shall,
no later than at the time of next reconstruction or excavation of the area
where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its assigned position
within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by Public Works
Director for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the
remaining economic life of the facilities, public health, safety or welfare, user
service needs and hardship to the ROW-user. (Ord. 2354, Sec 2, 2016)
I. If, in the preparation and planning of a right-of-way project, the Public Works
Director deems it appropriate for a conduit to be constructed along, across or
under the right-of-way, the Public Works Director shall contact all appropriate
ROW-users for their input on the planning and design of such conduit. If a
ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such
right-of-way, the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to use
such conduit, and to contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided,
however, the ROW-user’s use of the conduit is reasonable and appropriate
under the circumstances.
J. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public
improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the
ROW-user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the ROW-user at its
sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City. Upon
determination by the Public Works Director that such repair or replacement is
a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced
within twenty-four (24) hours of notice from the City, or the Public Works
Director may direct the city to make such repair or replacement and bill the
ROW-user for the City cost. The Public Works Director has the authority to
inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require
the ROW-user to do any necessary additional work.
K. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation,
operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of a ROW-user's
facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance with the Manual of
Infrastructure Standards and all applicable federal, state and local law and
regulations, including those promulgated by national trade associations
commonly associated with the service provided by the ROW-user. It is
understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum
standards and the requirements established or referenced in this article may
be in addition to or stricter than such minimum standards. A ROW-user shall
not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or
within the City right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a
description of its planned improvement to the Public Works Director and
having received a permit for such improvement. The Public Works Director
may require that any drawings, plans and/or specifications submitted be
certified by a Kansas registered professional engineer stating that such
drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical
13-18
codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on
nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on
the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization
applying for the permit.
L. The ROW-user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all
reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site
information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its
facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead,
when requested by the City or its authorized agent for a public improvement.
Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROW-user
without any expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized
contractors. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2; 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002; Ord. 2354
Sec. 2, 2016)
13-511. FACILITY RELOCATION.
A. The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located
in the right-of-way as directed by the City for a public improvement or when
reasonably required by the City by reason of public health, safety and
welfare. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the
ROW-user at the ROW-user's sole expense without expense to the City, its
employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject
to rules, regulations and schedules of the City pertaining to such. The ROWuser
shall proceed with relocations at due diligence upon notice by the City to
begin relocation.
B. The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located
in private easement, as directed by the City, for a public improvement, at City
expense, by moving such facilities to areas within the expanded right-of-way
or within remaining private easements or remaining portions of such
easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the City to avoid conflict with
City construction and improvements. The ROW-user shall disclaim those
parts of its easements which lie within the expanded right-of-way. Should the
City, in the future, elect to require the ROW-user to again relocate its facilities
to other areas within the expanded right-of-way, the cost of any such future
relocation shall be borne by the City.
C. As soon as working drawings are available for public improvements which will
require the ROW-user to relocate its facilities, the city shall provide the ROWuser
with written notice of relocations and the anticipated bid letting date of
said improvement. The ROW-user shall respond with any conflicts and a
proposed construction schedule within thirty (30) days.
D. Following notice by the City in the form of the delivery of final design plans for
such public improvements, the ROW-user shall remove, and relocate its
facilities in accordance with the mutually agreed upon schedule, provided the
project is not delayed by adverse weather conditions and other factors
beyond the control of the ROW-user. The ROW-user shall certify to the City,
in writing, that its facilities have been relocated or adjusted to clear
construction in accordance with project plans provided by the City.
E. Any damages suffered by the City, its agents or its contractors to the extent
caused by ROW-user's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities, or
13-19
failure to properly relocate or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the
ROW-user.
F In the event the ROW-user is required to move its facilities in accordance
with this section, any ordinary right-of-way permit fee shall be waived.
G. It is the intent of this section for both the City and the ROW-user to cooperate
with one another so that the need for facility relocation is minimized and,
when required and feasible, relocations may be completed prior to receipt of
bids by the City for a public improvement.
H. In the event that a ROW-user is required to move its facilities for a private
benefit, the ROW-user shall not bear the cost of the relocation or adjustment
to the extent of such private benefit, and the ROW-user shall not be obligated
to commence the relocation or adjustment until receipt of funds for such
relocation or adjustment.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002; Ord. 2354, Sec. 3, 2016)
13-512. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the ROW-user to take adequate measures to
protect and defend its facilities in the right-of-way from harm and damage.
B. The City shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any of the ROWuser's
facilities within the right-of-way as a result of or in connection with any
construction, excavation, grading, filling or work of any kind, including public
improvements by or on the behalf of the City, except to the extent caused by
the negligent, willful, intentional, or malicious acts or omissions of the City.
C. The ROW-user shall be responsible to the City and its agents,
representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages suffered by them
including, but not limited to delay damages, repair costs, down time,
construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the
failure of the ROW-user to timely perform any of its obligations under this
article to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the ROW-user.
D. The City or its authorized contractors shall be responsible for taking
reasonable precautionary measures including calling for facility locations
when constructing its public improvements.
E. Any ROW-user who for any purpose makes or causes to be made any
excavation in, upon, under, through or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley or
other right-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall
leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building or other
material during construction and/or the night time, shall cause the same to be
enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped
with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material
which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption.
F. Whenever a ROW-user shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk,
alley, driveway approach or other right-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain
an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the
excavation until it is refilled as specified.
G. Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type
street shall be securely covered. The ROW-user assumes the sole
responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing and/or
lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the
excavation is surfaced and opened for travel.
13-20
H. The Public Works Director, upon the review and approval of a plan and
details for trimming trees in the right-of-way, may grant permission by permit
to any ROW-user to trim trees upon and overhanging the right-of-way so as
to prevent such trees from coming in contact with the facilities of the ROWuser.
I. In the event the ROW-user severely disturbs or damages the root structure of
any tree in the right-of-way to the detriment of the health and safety of the
tree, the ROW-user will be required to remove and replace the tree at the
ROW-user's cost. Further, in review of the ROW-user's plan, Public Works
Director, in his or her discretion, may require the ROW-user to directionally
bore around any tree in the right-of-way.
J. Upon the appropriate request of any person having satisfied City procedure
and ordinances, the ROW-user shall remove, raise, or lower its facilities
temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. The expense
of such temporary removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the person
requesting the same, and the ROW-user may require such payment in
advance. The ROW-user must be given not less than fifteen (15) days written
notice from the person detailing the time and location of the moving
operations, and not less than twenty-four (24)-hours advance notice from the
person advising of the actual operation.
K. The Public Works Director may cause to be removed any encroachment in
the Right-of-Way that creates a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare,
and the cost of such removal and restoration of the right-of-way shall be
borne by the ROW-user.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002; Ord. 2354, Sec. 4; 2016)
13-513. RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
A. If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service
provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the service
provider's facilities, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all service
providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for the
right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way
and to enter upon such vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of
reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
B. If the vacation requires the relocation of facilities, and
1. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the service provider, the
service provider must pay the relocation costs.
2. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the service provider
must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City and
the service provider.
3. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person other than the
service provider or the City, such other person must pay the relocation
costs. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-514. ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
A. A ROW-user owning abandoned facilities in the right-of-way must either:
1. Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance
caused by the removal at its own expense. The Public Works Director
13-21
may allow underground facilities or portions thereof remain in place if the
Public Works Director determines that it is in the best interest of public
health, safety, or welfare to do so. At such time, the City may take
ownership and responsibility of such vacated facilities left in place; or
2. Provide information satisfactory to the city that the ROW-user's
obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully
assumed by another authorized ROW-user: or
3. Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership
of its facilities to the city. If the ROW-user proceeds under this section,
the City may, at its option purchase the equipment, require the ROWuser,
at its own expense, to remove it, or require the ROW-user to post
a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonable
anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities.
B. Facilities of a ROW-user who fails to comply with this section, and whose
facilities remain unused for two (2) years, shall be deemed to be abandoned
after the City has made a good faith effort to contact the ROW-user, unless
the City receives confirmation that the ROW-user intends to use the facilities.
Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise
any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to,
1. abating the nuisance,
2. taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a
useable function, or
3. requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW-user.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002; Ord. 2354, Sec. 5, 2016)
13-515. Permit Requirement.
A. Except as otherwise provided, no ROW-user may excavate any right-of-way
or conduct any repair, construction, or reconstruction of facilities located
within the right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-ofway
permit.
B. There are two exemptions to this provision:
1. Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public
improvements.
2. ROW-users performing routine service operations which do not require
excavation in the right-of-way and do not disrupt traffic for more than
four (4) hours.
C. No person owning or occupying any land abutting on a public right-of-way
shall construct, maintain, or permit in or on the portion of the public right-ofway
to which such land is adjacent, any fixed structure, material or object
without having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit.
D. A right-of-way permit is required for emergency situations. If due to an
emergency it is necessary for the ROW-user to immediately perform work in
the right-of-way, and it is impractical for the ROW-user to first get the
appropriate permit, the work may be performed, and the required permit shall
be obtained as soon as possible during the next City working day.
E. No permittee may excavate the right-of-way beyond the date or dates
specified in the right-of-way permit unless the permittee:
1. Makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit
before the expiration of the initial permit, and,
13-22
2. A new right-of-way permit or permit extension is granted.
F. Right-of-way permits issued shall be conspicuously displayed by the
permittee at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for
inspection by the Public Works Director, other City employees and the public.
G. Prior to the commencement of excavation, the permittee shall identify and
locate any buried facilities to be spray painted according to the Uniform Color
Code required by the Kansas One Call.
H. All excavations by the permittee shall have a metal marker inserted into the
excavation of the restored pavement, which shall identify the ROW-user.
I. Before receiving a right-of-way permit, the applicant must show proof of any
necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise
agreement or any other authorization required by any appropriate
governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the
KCC.
J. Any ROW-user who is found to be working in the public right-of-way without a
permit will be directed to stop work until a permit is acquired and properly
posted at the work site. The only exception allowed is for emergency repair
work.
K. Any permittee found to be working without providing for required safety and
traffic control will be directed to stop work until the appropriate measures are
implemented in accordance with the current edition of the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-516. PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
A. Application for a right-of-way permit shall be submitted to the Public Works
Director either by the ROW-user or by the person who will do the work and/or
excavation in the right-of-way. Before an application may be submitted, the
applicant must attend a pre-application meeting with designated City staff,
unless waived by the Public Works Director (Ord. 2354, Sec. 6, 2016)
B. Right-of-way applications shall contain and be considered complete only
upon receipt of the following:
1. Compliance with verification of registration;
2. Submission of a completed permit application form, including all
required attachments and scaled drawings showing the location and
area of the proposed project and the location of all existing and
proposed facilities at such location;
3. A traffic control plan;
4. Payment of all money due to the city for permit fees and costs, for prior
excavation costs, for any loss, damage or expense suffered by the City
because of the applicant's prior excavations of the right-of-way or for
any emergency actions taken by the City, unless the payment of such
money is in dispute and timely appealed as provided hereafter.
C. All applications shall be processed within the timeframes required by state
and federal law. (Ord. 2354, Sec. 6, 2016)
D. If an applicant has submitted an application for a permit for the installation,
construction, maintenance, or repair of multiple facilities, that applicant may
not submit another application for a permit for the installation, construction,
maintenance, or repair of multiple facilities until the first application has been
13-23
approved or denied. This provision may be waived by the Public Works
Director. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1; Ord. 2354, Sec. 6, 2016)
13-517. LIABILITY INSURANCE, PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE BOND
REQUIREMENT.
A. The permittee shall file with the City evidence of commercial general and
automobile liability insurance with an insurance company licensed to do
business in Kansas. The general liability limit will be not less than one million
dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and $2,000,000 in aggregate. The
automobile liability limit will not be less than one million ($1,000,000)
combined single limit. The insurance will protect the City from and against all
claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury,
bodily injury, death, or property damage to the extent caused or alleged to
have been caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the permittee. If the
permittee is self-insured, it shall provide the City proof of compliance
regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in
the above amounts.
B. The permittee shall at all times during the term of the permit, and for two (2)
years thereafter, maintain a performance and maintenance bond in a form
approved by the City Attorney. The amount of the bond will be $5,000 or the
value of time restoration, whichever is greater, for a term consistent with the
term of the permit plus two (2) additional years, conditioned upon the
permittee's faithful performance of the provisions, terms and conditions
conferred by this article. An annual bond in an amount of $50,000
automatically renewed yearly during this period shall satisfy the requirement
of this section. In the event the City shall exercise its right to revoke the
permit as granted herein, then the City shall be entitled to recover under the
terms of said bond the full amount of any loss occasioned.
C. A copy of the Liability Insurance Certificate and Performance and
Maintenance Bond must be on file with the City Clerk.
D. No performance and maintenance bond or liability insurance will be required
of any governmental entity, or of any residential property owner working in
the right-of-way adjacent to his/her residence, who does not utilize a
contractor to perform the excavation. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047,
Sec. 1, 2002)
13-518. RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT FEES.
A. The right-of-way permit fee and other appropriate fees, including but limited
to inspection fees, excavation fees, pole attachment fees and franchise fees,
shall be recommended by the Public Works Director, approved by the
governing body and listed in the Schedule of Fees maintained in the City
Clerk's office, as such Schedule may be amended from time to time. An
application shall not be deemed submitted unless the right-of-way permit fee
is paid. The right-of-way permit fee shall be subject to all state and federal
fee limitations. (Ord. 2354, Sec. 7, 2016)
B. Fees paid for a right-of-way permit, which is subsequently revoked by the
Public Works Director, are not refundable.
C. Except as provided for in an emergency situation, when a ROW-user is found
to have worked or is working in the right-of-way without having obtained a
13-24
permit, the fee for the permit will be double the amount had the ROW-user
obtained a permit prior to beginning work.
D. The City may also charge and collect any necessary repair and restoration
costs. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002; Ord. 2354, Sec.
7, 2016))
13-519. ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
A. If the Public Works Director determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this article, the public works director shall issue a right-ofway
permit.
B. The Public Works Director may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of a right-of-way permit and the performance of the permittee in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to ensure the structural
integrity of the right-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users
of the right-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the
traveling public.
C. When a right-of-way permit is requested for purposes of installing additional
facilities and the performance and maintenance bond for additional facilities
is reasonably determined to be insufficient, the posting of an additional or
larger performance and maintenance bond for the additional facilities may be
required.
D. Issued permits are not transferable.
E. If work is being done for the ROW-user by another person, a subcontractor
or otherwise, the person doing the work and the ROW-user shall be liable
and responsible for all damages, obligations, and warranties herein
described.
F. For the purposes of defining replacement of facilities, the City considers any
repair or replacement of a facility that is in such disrepair that substantial
replacement is required, to be a new facility. In cases of natural disaster
events, restoration of facilities will be considered as neither new nor
replacement, but as an emergency repair.
G. All right-of-way permits will be issued with a maximum of ninety (90) calendar
days to complete the work. Any work beyond the expiration of the permit will
be as provided in the provisions of this Article with regard to Supplementary
Applications.
H. Individual right-of-way permits are limited to a maximum of 2,500 feet of
contiguous work length. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1)
15-520. PERMITTED WORK.
A. The permittee shall not make any cut, excavation or grading of right-of-way
other than excavations necessary for emergency repairs without first securing
a right-of-way permit.
B. The permittee shall not at any one time open or encumber more of the rightof-
way than shall be reasonably necessary to enable the permittee to
complete the project in the most expeditious manner.
C. The permittee shall, in the performance of any work required for the
installation, repair, maintenance, relocation and/or removal of any of its
facilities, limit all excavations to those excavations that are necessary for
efficient operation.
13-25
D. The permittee shall not permit such an excavation to remain open longer than
is necessary to complete the repair or installation.
E. The permittee shall notify the City no less than three (3) working days in
advance of any construction, reconstruction, repair, location or relocation of
facilities which would require any street closure or which reduces traffic flow
to less than two (2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four (4) hours.
Except in the event of an emergency as reasonably determined by the
permittee, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior
authorization from the City.
F. Non-emergency work on arterial and collector streets may not be performed
during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., in
order to minimize disruption of traffic flow.
G. All work performed in the right-of-way or which in any way impacts vehicular
or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise
protected at the permittee's expense. Such signage shall be in conformance
with the latest edition of the Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices, unless otherwise agreed to by the City.
H. The permittee shall provide identify and locate any underground facilities in
conformance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act
“Kansas One Call” system, and notice shall be provided directly to Johnson
County Water District #1 and either to Kansas City Power and Light (KCPL)
or to the Traffic Operations section of the Public Works Department with
respect to any municipal traffic signal and street light systems, as
appropriate.
I. The permittee shall be liable for any damages to underground facilities due to
excavation work prior to obtaining location of such facilities, or for any
damage to underground facilities that have been properly identified prior to
excavation. The permittee shall not make or attempt to make repairs,
relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed underground facilities
without the approval of the owner of the facilities.
J. Whenever there is an excavation by the permittee, the permittee shall be
responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the surrounding area as
determined by Public Works Director of the City. The permittee shall perform
work on the right-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference
with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. In
the event the excavation is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the
permittee may be liable for actual damages to the City for delay caused by
the permittee pursuant to this article.
K. All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed and maintained by the
permittee shall be laid, constructed and maintained in accordance with
acceptable engineering practice and in full accord with any and all applicable
engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in accordance
with applicable statutes of the State of Kansas, as well as the rules and
regulations of the Kansas Corporation Commission or any other local, state
or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties.
L. Following completion of permitted work for new construction, the permittee
shall keep, maintain and provide to the City accurate records and as-built
drawings, drawn to scale and certified to the City as accurately depicting the
location of all utility facilities constructed pursuant to the permit. When
13-26
available to the permittee, maps and drawings provided will be submitted in
AUTOCAD.DXF or AUTOCAD.DWG automated formats if available, or in
hard copy otherwise. The Public Works Director may waive this requirement.
Such information shall be subject in all respects and shall have the benefit of
protection as set forth in the “Mapping Requirements of Service Provider”
contained herein.
M. The City may use the as-built records of the service provider's facilities in
connection with public improvements.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-521. RIGHT-OF-WAY REPAIR AND RESTORATION.
A. The work to be done under the right-of-way permit and the repair and
restoration of the right-of-way as required herein must be completed within
the dates as specified in the permit. However, in the event of circumstances
beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited by
unseasonable or unreasonable conditions, the Public Works Director may
extend the date for completion of the project upon receipt of a supplementary
application for a permit extension.
B. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossing, utilities, public improvement
or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the permittee shall be
fully repaired or replaced promptly by the permittee at its sole expense and
the reasonable satisfaction of the City. The Public Works Director has the
authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if
necessary, to require the permittee to do the additional necessary work.
Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be
provided to the permittee and a reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15)
days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected.
C. After any excavation, the permittee shall, at its expense, restore all portions
of the right-of-way to the same condition or better condition than it was prior
to the excavation thereof.
D. In addition to repairing its own street cuts, the permittee must restore any
area within five (5) feet of the new street cut that has previously been
excavated, including the paving and its aggregate foundations.
E. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the Public Works Director, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all restoration the City may, at its option, serve written notice
upon the permittee and its surety that, unless within five (5) days after serving
of such notice, a satisfactory arrangement can be made for the proper
restoration of the right-of-way, the City shall immediately serve notice of
failure to comply upon the surety and the permittee, and the surety shall have
the right to take over and complete the work; provided, however, that if the
surety does not commence performance thereof within ten (10) days from
the date of notice, the City may take over the work and prosecute same to
completion, by contract or otherwise at the expense of the permittee, and the
permittee and its surety shall be liable to the City for any and all excess cost
assumed by the City by reason of such prosecution and completion.
F. The permittee responsible for the excavation that leaves any debris in the
right-of-way shall be responsible for providing safety protection in accordance
13-27
with the latest edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and
any applicable federal or state requirement.
G. If an excavation cannot be back-filled immediately and left unattended, the
permittee shall securely and adequately cover the unfilled excavation. The
permittee has sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, safety
fencing and/or lights as required, from the time of the opening of the
excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel.
H. In restoring the right-of-way, the permittee guarantees its work and shall
maintain it for twenty-four (24) months following its completion. During the
twenty-four (24) months the permittee shall, upon notification from the Public
Works Director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using
any method as required by the public works director. Said work shall be
completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
of the receipt of notice from the Public Works Director (not including days
during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting
force Majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable). In the event the permittee is required to perform new
restoration pursuant to the foregoing guarantee, the public works director
shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for such new
restoration for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months from the date of
the new restoration, if the Public Works Director determines any overt action
by the permittee not to comply with the conditions of the right-of-way permit
and any restoration requirements.
I. The twenty-four (24) month guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of
the pavement surface as well as failure below the pavement surface.
J. Payment of an excavation fee shall not relieve the permittee of the obligation
to complete the necessary right-of-way restoration.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-522. JOINT APPLICATIONS.
A. Applicants may apply jointly for permits to excavate the right-of-way at the
same time and place.
B. Applicants who apply jointly for a right-of-way permit may share in the
payment of the permit fee. Applicants must agree among themselves as to
the portion each shall pay.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-523. SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
A. A right-of-way permit shall only be valid for the area of the right-of-way
specified within the permit. No permittee may cause any work to be done
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee who determines that an area greater than that which is specified in
the permit must be excavated must do the following prior to the
commencement of work in that greater area:
1. make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
2. receive a new right-of-way permit or permit extension.
B. A right-of-way permit shall be valid only for the dates specified in the permit.
No permittee may commence work before the permit start date or, except as
13-28
provided herein, may continue working after the end date. If a permittee does
not complete the work by the permit end date, the permittee must apply for
and receive a new right-of-way permit or a permit extension for additional
time. This supplementary application must be submitted to the City prior to
the permit end date. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-524. OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
A. Obtaining a right-of-way permit under this article shall not relieve the
permittee of its duty to obtain any necessary permit, license, certification,
grant, registration, franchise agreement or any other authorization required
by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to the City,
the FCC or the KCC, and to pay any fees required by any other City, County,
State, or Federal rules, laws, or regulations. A permittee shall perform all
work in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or
approved by the parties and in accordance with applicable statutes of the
State of Kansas, and the rules and regulations of the KCC or any other local,
state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. A permittee shall
perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established
rules and regulations and shall be responsible for all work done in the rightof-
way pursuant to its permit, regardless by whom the work is done by.
B. Except in cases of an emergency or with approval of the Public Works
Director, no right-of-way work may be done when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.
C. A permittee shall not disrupt a right-of-way such that the natural free and
clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways is interfered
with. Private vehicles may not be parked within or next to the permit area.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-525. DENIAL OF PERMIT.
A. The Public Works Director may deny a permit or prohibit the use or occupancy
of a specific portion of the right-of-way to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way
and its users. The Public Works Director, at his or her discretion, may
consider all relevant factors including but not limited to:
1. The extent to which the right-of-way space where the permit is sought is
available;
2. The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way;
3. The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other right-ofway
for the facilities of the applicant;
4. The applicability of any ordinance or other regulations, including City
zoning regulations, that affect location of facilities in the right-of-way;
5. The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions
of its franchise, this article, and other applicable ordinances and
regulations;
6. The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses
that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way;
13-29
7. The balancing of costs of disruption to the public and damage to the
right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the
construction in the right-of-way;
8. Whether the applicant maintains a current registration with the City.
9. Whether the issuance of a right-of-way permit for the particular dates
and/or time requested would cause a conflict or interferes with an
exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. In exercising this
discretion, the Public Works Director shall be guided by the safety and
convenience of anticipated travel of the public over the right-of-way.
10. Whether the application complies with the Manual of Infrastructure
Standards.
11. The adverse impact of the facilities or the facilities’ proposed location on
any reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety, or
welfare.
B. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Public Works Director may in his
or her discretion issue a right-of-way permit in any case where the permit is
necessary to:
1. Prevent substantial economic hardship to a user of the applicant's
service;
2. Allow such user to materially improve the service provided by the
applicant.
C. Any denial of wireless communications antenna, tower, or related facilities
shall, in accordance with federal and state law, be made in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record issued
contemporaneously with said decision. (Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047,
Sec.1, 2002; Ord. 2354, Sec. 8, 2016)
13-526. REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
A. Permittees hold right-of-way permits issued pursuant to this Article as a
privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any right-of-way permits, without refund of the permit fee, in the event
of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or the right-ofway
permit. A substantial breach shall include, but not be limited to the
following:
1. The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
2. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens:
3. Any material misrepresentation of any fact in the permit application;
4. The failure to maintain the required bond or insurance;
5. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner;
6. The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant
to this Article;
7. Repeated traffic control violations; or
8. Failure to repair facilities damaged in the right-of-way.
B. If the Public Works Director determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of any law or condition placed on the right-of-way permit,
the Public Works Director shall make a written demand upon the permittee to
remedy such violation. The demand shall state that the continued violation
13-30
may be cause for revocation of the permit, or legal action if applicable.
Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the public works
director, at his or her discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on
the right-of-way permit, specifically related to the manner in which the breach
is cured by the permittee. Within five (5) calendar days of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the public works director
with a plan, acceptable to the Public Works Director, for correction of the
breach. Permittee's failure to contact the Public Works Director, permittee's
failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate revocation of the
right-of-way permit.
C. If a right-of-way permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including administrative costs, restoration
costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in
connection with such revocation.
(Ord. 1982, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-527. WORK REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS.
A. Any excavation, back filling, repair and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with the City's
Manual of Infrastructure Standards as promulgated by the Public Works
Director.
B. The permittee shall employ a testing laboratory as approved by the Public
Works Director, which shall certify the proper back-filling on any street cut.
The permittee shall pay all costs associated with such testing. This provision
shall be waived when flowable fill is used as backfill or with the permission of
the Public Works Director.
C. The permittee shall notify the office of the Public Works Director upon
completion of the authorized work permit.
D. The permittee will notify the public works director to schedule an inspection at
the start of back-filling. Upon completion of all right-of-way restoration
activities, the permittee will schedule a closeout inspection.
E. When any corrective actions required have been completed and inspected to
the Public Works Director's satisfaction, the two (2)-year maintenance period
will begin.
F. In addition to the required scheduled inspections, the Public Works Director
may choose to inspect the ongoing permitted work in the right-of-way at any
time to ensure that all requirements of the approved permit are being met by
the permittee.
G. At the time of any inspection, the Public Works Director may order the
immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety, or well being of the public. The Public Works Director may
issue a citation to the permittee for any work, which does not conform, to the
applicable standards, conditions, code or terms of the permit. The citation
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of
the permit. (Ord. 1082, Sec. 2, 1995; Ord. 2047, Sec. 1, 2002)
13-528. APPEALS PROCESS.
13-31

14-102. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
A. The purpose of this Stormwater Pollution Prevention Code shall be to prevent
the discharge of pollutants from land and activities within the City into the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and/or into surface waters.
B. The Governing Body of the City hereby finds that pollutants are discharged
into surface waters, both through inappropriate non-stormwater discharges
into the MS4 or the surface waters directly, and through the wash off and
transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by stormwater
during rainfall events.
C. Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharge of
pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals,
particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may degrade the
quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation, recreation,
and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams,
lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of
plants and animals.
D. Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that this ordinance will
promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge
of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum
products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and
other pollutants into the storm drainage system.
E. Further, the Governing Body of the City Further, the Governing Body of the
City hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions
and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES), and other federal and state requirements for
water quality and environmental preservation.
F. Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that a reasonable
establishment of restrictions and regulations on activities within the City is
necessary to eliminate or minimize such discharges of pollutants, to protect
the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value
of existing water resources within the City and within downstream
communities, and to comply with the provisions of the City's responsibilities

ARTICLE 2. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. The purpose of this Article shall be to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls on any new development or
redevelopment projects. This Article also establishes requirements for long-term maintenance
of structural controls within the City for drainages into the municipal separate storm sewer
system and/or into surface waters. This ordinance seeks to meet this purpose through the
following objectives:
a. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to
reduce flooding, siltation, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
b. Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff
from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality,
particularly if receiving water bodies are classified as impaired on the current
version of the 303d listing of impaired waters in Kansas as identified by the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE);
c. Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment
hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
d. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-point source
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management best
management practices (BMPs); ensure the BMPs are maintained properly; and
pose no threat to public safety. (Ord. 2163, Sec II, 2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12,
2008)
14-201. POLLUTION DISCHARGE. The Governing Body of the City of Prairie
Village hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface water through the
wash off and transport of storm water runoff from disturbed land during rainfall
events.
a. Further, the Governing Body of the City of Prairie Village hereby finds that such
discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to
individuals, particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may
degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation,
recreation, and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers,
streams, lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and
abundance of plants and animals.
b. Further, the Governing Body of the City of Prairie Village hereby finds that this
ordinance will promote public awareness of damage to water quality, water
bodies, and wetlands caused by storm water runoff from land disturbance
activities or increased impervious surfaces.
c. Further, the Governing Body of the City of Prairie Village hereby finds that such
discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the Clean Water
Act (CWA), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and
other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental
preservation.
d. Further, the Governing Body of the City of Prairie Village hereby finds that the
reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on land disturbance
activities or increased impervious surfaces within the City of Prairie Village is
necessary to eliminate or minimize such storm water runoff to protect the health
and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value of existing
Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-10
water resources within the City of Prairie Village and within downstream
communities, and to comply with the provisions of the City’s responsibilities
under the Clean Water Act and the NPDES program.
e. Further, the Governing Body of Prairie Village hereby finds that uncontrolled
storm water runoff, especially floodwaters, can pose a hazard to property, both
public and private, and public infrastructure and can endanger human life.
These regulations specify certain controls and restrictions to attenuate or avoid
flooding within the City, and are to supplement the requirements of the City
Floodplain Management requirements.
f. Finally, the Governing Body of the City of Prairie Village hereby finds that the
proper management of stormwater is dependent on the adequate function and
performance of the stormwater features. These regulations establish controls
to prohibit or minimize any activity which will adversely affect hydraulic function
of any stormwater drainage facilities, public or private, including, but not limited
to detention facilities, open channels (either engineered or natural), drainage
swales, or enclosed stormwater conveyance systems. (Ord. 2163, Sec. II,
2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12, 2008)
14-202. APPLICABILITY. The provisions of this article shall extend and apply to
all land and existing or proposed improvements thereon within the corporate limits
of the City. Any person proposing to construct buildings, develop land, make
improvements to existing buildings, or take any action which will create a land
disturbance or cause a change in existing stormwater runoff shall make application
to the Director of Public Works for issuance of a Drainage Permit as specified in
this Article. No land shall be disturbed, developed or improvements constructed
except upon issuance of such permit. (Ord. 2163, Sec. II, 2008; Ord. 2169, Sec.
12, 2008)
14-203. INTERPRETATIONS. The provisions of this title are intended to
supplement existing zoning and land use ordinances of the City. In their
interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to
be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and
general welfare. (Ord. 1698, Sec. 1; Ord. 2163, Sec. II, 2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12,
2008)
14-204. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAW. These regulations shall not be
construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing
regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accruing
or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person as waiving any right of
the city under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these
regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person by lawful
action of the City, except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
(Ord. 1698, Sec. 1; Ord. 2163, Sec. II, 2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12, 2008)
14-205. PUBLIC PROVISION. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other
provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any
other ordinance, rule or regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions
are more restrictive or impose higher standards, shall control. (Ord. 2163, Sec. II,
Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-11
2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12, 2008)
14-206. PRIVATE PROVISIONS. These regulations are not intended to
abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction,
provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or
impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or private agreement or restriction
impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the
requirements of these regulations, and such private provisions are inconsistent with
these regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall
be operative and supplemental to these regulations and determinations made
hereunder. (Ord. 1698, Sec. 1; Ord. 2162, Sec. II, 2008; Ord. 2169, Sec. 12, 2008)
14-207. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. The performance standards and design
criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirements which must be
implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. Use of the
requirements contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or
warranty of any kind by the city, its agents, or its officers and employees, of the
adequacy or safety of any stormwater management plan, structure or use of land.

Concept Plan shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Kansas. The plan will:
a. Demonstrate that stormwater runoff from the proposed project will not
adversely affect downstream properties. The analysis shall, at a minimum,
demonstrate that construction site sediments will be adequately controlled
on the site and that stormwater discharge quantities will not increase the
frequency or extent of downstream flooding.
b. Indicate that adequate area is allowed for all required stormwater features,
including detention basins, BMPs, and stormwater conveyances. Proposed
easements, where required, will also be indicated.
c. Present the existing land features and uses, including all structures, utilities,
existing stormwater features, both natural and engineered, and vegetation
and soil types. The Plan will also present the proposed changes to land use,
impervious surfaces, and vegetation. The plan will quantify the hydrologic
changes and present the proposed BMPs in accordance with the
Engineering Standards, defined in the Article, based on the proposed
changes to the property.
d. Demonstrate that the proposed project will not adversely affect the
regulatory floodplain and that the requirements of the City Floodplain
Management are satisfied.
e. Present the ultimate planned build-out conditions for the property and
demonstrate how the storm drainage system will accommodate the planned
phases of construction.
f. Describe the impact the proposed development and proposed land uses will
have on stormwater quality. The plan should discuss the sources of
stormwater pollution, including “hot spots” areas where land use or activities
may generate runoff with concentrations of pollutants in excess of those
typically found in stormwater. Examples of such “hot spots” include trash
dumpster areas, fueling islands, and grease traps. The plan shall describe
the types and layout of proposed BMPs to mitigate for these impacts to

projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
a. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on
the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be
designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the
water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
b. The Community shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other development within
the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community

Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-31
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood elevation, providing items two (2) through six (6) below
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half
acre, the technical jurisdiction required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon
determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s
continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase
in flood discharge would result.
4. Variances shall not be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient
cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
6. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a
community official that: (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below base flood elevation will result in increase premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage and (b) such construction below the base flood elevation increases
risk to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record

address problems in areas of the CITY that currently are prone to frequent major
flooding, protect property in the CITY from stream bank erosion and the
attendant loss of natural resources and the reduction of property values,
conserve natural stream assets within the CITY, enhance water quality, and
assist in complying with the mandates of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System as created under the Federal Clean Water Act and

B. Maintenance of Control Measures. All prescribed Erosion and Sediment Control
measures shall be maintained in good order and in compliance with the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan at all times.
C. Routine Inspection. It shall be the duty of the Permit Holder to routinely inspect
the construction site and maintain effective Erosion and Sediment Control measures.
Routine inspections shall be performed once per month or more frequently if required
Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-52
on the Plan and within 24 hours following each rainfall event of ½-inch or more within
any 24 hour period. A log shall be kept of these inspections by the Permit Holder. Any
deficiencies shall be noted in a report of the inspection and include the action taken to
correct the deficiency. Inspection reports shall be submitted to the Director upon
request. The inspection report shall include the following minimum information:

measures.
4. Actions necessary to correct deficiencies.
5. Signature of Person performing the inspection.
D. Compliance Verification. The Director may also perform inspections of the Land
Disturbance site to verify compliance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
Should it be found that Erosion and control methods are ineffective or are not being
maintained properly, the Director may take enforcement actions described within this
Chapter.
E. Closure of Land Disturbance Activities. Once the site is stabilized a final
inspection shall be requested. The site shall be considered stabilized when Perennial
Vegetation, pavement, buildings or structures using permanent materials, cover all
areas that have been disturbed. Perennial Vegetation shall be considered established
and completed for stabilization when it has established a healthy and growing stand
with a density of at least 80 percent of undisturbed areas at the site.
F. Removal of Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Measures. Subsequent
to a satisfactory final inspection of the Land Disturbance, all temporary Erosion and
Sediment Control measures must be removed and the segments of the storm sewer
system shall be inspected for any sediment removal. Such removal shall be complete
prior to closure of the Permit which authorized the Land Disturbance.
(Ord. 2180, Sec. 1, 2008)
14-507. ENFORCEMENT
A. General. The Director shall handle enforcement of the provisions of this
Chapter through routine activities that include receiving inspection reports from the
Permit Holder when requested, inspections, and communication with contractors.
However, if these methods fail, the Director may proceed with any or all of the following
enforcement measures:
B. Refusal of Inspection. Request for an inspection of any permitted construction
activity may be denied if it is found that Erosion and Sediment control measures have
not been implemented, or are found to be ineffective or are not maintained. If an
inspection is refused, a notice of violation or a stop work order may be issued. No
further inspections will be performed until the Erosion and control measures have been
implemented or violations abated.
C. Notice of Violation. The Director is authorized to serve a Notice of Violation or
order on any Person found to be doing work in violation of the provisions of this Code.
Such order shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and order the
abatement of the violation by the responsible Person.
D. Stop Work Order. The Director is authorized to issue a stop work order for any or
all construction activity without an approved permit or within the established boundary of
the Permit. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be mailed by certified mail
to the owner of the property involved, or the owner’s agent or to the Person doing the
Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-53
work. In addition, notice of the stop work order shall be posted on the site. Upon
issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work
order shall state the reason for the order and the conditions under which the cited work
will be permitted to resume. Any Person, who shall continue to work after having been
served with a stop work order, except such work as that Person is directed by the City to
perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, is guilty of a public offense and may
be subject to penalties as in the Code.
E. Abatement. Should any Person fail to comply with the provisions of this Code,
the Director is authorized to correct or abate such violation. This action can be taken in
lieu of, or in conjunction with, any action taken, or enforcement actions set forth in this
Chapter.
F. Abatement Costs by City. City expenditures to correct or abate a violation shall
be assessed as a fee against the Permit issued for work at the same site. The City will
keep a record of the abatement costs. The fee shall be paid prior to recommencement
of work on the site and prior to any further inspections. If the fee is not paid within 30
days of the date the invoice is sent to the Permit Holder, the Director is authorized, as
the Director deems appropriate, to expend additional abatement funds to provide
permanent soil stabilization on the site. Such additional expenditures shall also be
assessed as a fee against the Land Disturbance, or other Permit issued for work on the
same site.
G. Recovery of City Abatement Costs. Should the Permit become suspended,
revoked, or expired with the fee not paid, all City expenditures to correct or abate the
violation may be assessed as a lien and special assessment against the lot or parcel of
land on which the permitted activity took place. The same abatement and collection
procedure shall apply if work is done without the issuance of a Permit. After thirty
calendar days of receipt of abatement notice, the City Clerk, at the time of certifying
other City taxes, shall certify the unpaid portion of the costs and the County Clerk shall
extend the same on the tax rolls of the county against the lot or parcel of land.
H. Surety. Prior to approval of a Permit that authorizes the disturbance of one acre
or more of land, the Director shall require surety in the form of a bond, cash deposit or
letter of credit, approved by the City, to be used to offset the costs of abatement of
erosion and sediment caused by the land disturbance, including removal of the
temporary BMP and where applicable, their replacement. The surety amount,
established and reviewed by the Director, shall be based on the estimated cost to the
City of providing temporary Erosion control and establishing Perennial Vegetation on
typical project sites and may be increased to include costs associated with removing
temporary BMP and repairing or cleaning segments of the storm sewer system. The
surety amount will be proportioned based on the acreage of the site. If the surety is
furnished in the form of a letter of credit, the amount shall equal the surety amount or
five thousand dollars ($5,000), whichever is greater. Amounts not used for abatement
shall be returned to the Permit Holder after final inspection and approval to close the
Permit.
(Ord. 2180, Sec. 1, 2008)
14-508. VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
A. Failure to Comply. Any Person who violates a provision of this Ordinance, fails
to comply with any of the requirements thereof or fails to comply with a directive issued
by the Director is guilty of a public offense and shall be subject to penalties as provided
in the City Code.
Table of Contents Chapter Index
14-54
B. Citation of Owner. The City Code Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to cite
the owner, or any/all Persons identified on a Permit as being legally responsible to the
City for any violations of the Ordinance pertaining to that Permit.
(Ord. 2180, Sec. 1, 2008)
14-509. MISCELLANEOUS
A. Other Laws. Neither this Ordinance nor any administrative decision made under
it exempts the Permit Holder or any other Person from other requirements of this Code,
state and federal laws, or from procuring other required Permits, including any state or
federal stormwater Permits authorized under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES), or limits the right of any Person to maintain, at any time,
any appropriate action at law or in equity, for relief or damages against the Permit
Holder or any Person arising from the activity regulated by this Ordinance.
B. Disclaimer of Liability. The performance standards and design criteria set forth
herein establish minimum requirements, which must be implemented with good
engineering practice and workmanship. Use of the requirements contained herein shall
not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the City, or its
officers and employees, of the adequacy or safety of any best management practice or
use of land, nor shall the approval and issuance of a Permit imply that land uses
permitted will be free from damages caused by Storm Water. The degree of protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on historical records and engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
storms may occur or Storm Water runoff heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations therefore shall not create liability on the part of the
City or any officer with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
C. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase in
this Ordinance or any part thereof is held to be unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of
the remaining portions of this Ordinance.

and Environment (KDHE)
3. Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development
hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable
4. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management best management
practices (BMPs) and to ensure that these BMPs are properly maintained and pose
no threat to public safety.

reasonable regulations for the posting of informational signs on public
and private property.
Temporary Signs left completely unregulated, can become a threat to
public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values as an
aesthetic nuisance.
By implementing these regulations, the City intends to:
(A) balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through
temporary signs and the right of the public to be protected against
the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(B) further the objectives of the City’s comprehensive plan;
Table of Contents Chapter Index
1618
(C) protect the public health, safety and welfare;
(D) reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(E) protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects
and visual blight caused by signs;
(F) promote economic development; and
(G) ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of the temporary sign
regulations specified in the following.
(2) Regulations. Temporary signs may be posted on property in all Zoning
Districts of the City, subject to the following requirements:
(A) The total square footage for temporary signs in any district, in the
aggregate, shall not exceed fortyeight
(48) square feet, with no
individual sign exceeding sixteen (16) square feet. The total square
footage of a sign is measured to include all of the visible display area
of only one side of the sign and only the area of one side of a double
sided sign is included in the aggregate calculation.
(B) Signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height measured from the
average grade at the base of the sign.
(C) No sign shall obstruct or impair access to a public sidewalk, public or
private street or driveway, traffic control sign, bus stop, fire hydrant,
or any other type of street furniture, or otherwise create a hazard,
including a tripping hazard.
(D) No sign shall be illuminated or painted with lightreflecting
paint.
(E) A sign shall only be posted with the consent of the property owner or
occupant. Signs posted in the public rightofway
may only be
posted with the permission of the abutting property owner.
(F) A temporary sign may be posted for a period of up to ninety (90)
days, at which time the sign shall be removed or replaced.
(G) Signs shall not be posted on trees, utility poles, and other similar
structures within the rightsofway.
(3) Removal or Replacement of Informational Signs:
(A) The person who has posted or directed the posting of the sign is
responsible for the removal or replacement of that sign.
(B) If that person does not remove or replace the sign in accordance with
these regulations, then the property owner or occupant of the
building or lot where the sign is posted is responsible for the sign’s
removal or replacement.
(C) “If the Building Official finds that any sign is posted in violation of
these regulations on public property, the Building Official is
authorized to remove any such signs. If the Building Official finds
that any sign posted in violation of these regulations on private
property, (s)he shall give written notice to the person who has posted
or directed the posting of the sign. If that person fails to remove or
replace the sign so as to comply with the standards herein set forth
within seventytwo
(72) house after such notice, such sign may be
removed by the Building Official.”

Table of Contents Chapter Index
1619
or 12 feet from the back of curb of the street and shall be landscaped at the base.
All monument signs shall be constructed with permanent building materials that
are similar to or complement existing building materials and colors used on the
buildings located in the site. If the sign is not located within the landscape
setback area, the sign base shall be located with a landscaped area extending a
minimum of three feet on all sides of the sign base and a landscape plan shall be
submitted for approval. All monument signs including the landscape plan shall
be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission based on the above
requirements prior to obtaining a permit and being installed.
(n) Sign Area Calculations.
(1) Monument Signs. The area shall include the sign panel but not the sign
base on which it is mounted or the structural elements or frames that
form the perimeter of the panel.

calculation shall be the area of the panel. If the sign consists of individual
letter, symbols or words, either painted or mounted on the wall, the area
shall be the smallest rectangular figure that can encompass all of the
letters, words, logos or symbols.
(3) Band Signs. The area of a band sign shall be the width of the band times
the outside extremities of the letters, words, logos or symbols contained
within the band.

five (5) feet from any adjacent side or rear property line.
(p) Obscene Materials.
Obscene signs, flags, banners, or any sign of any type are prohibited.
“Obscene” is defined as any material that (a) whether the average person,
applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as
a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or
describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by
the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
(q) Substitution of Messages.
Subject to the landowner’s consent, a noncommercial message of any type may
be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any
duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided that the Sign of
Sign Structure is legal without consideration of message content. This
substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or
permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring
of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular
noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This
provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a
parcel or land use, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or
mounting device be properly permitted. This provision does not allow for the
substitution of an offsite commercial message in place of an onsite commercial
message.

19.06.005 Purpose and Intent. 
19.06.010 Use Regulations. 
19.06.015 Development Standards.

19.06.045 Parking Regulations. 
19.06.050 Site Plan Approval and Public Notice. 
19.06.005 Purpose and Intent. 
Prairie Village is, for the most part, a single-family residential community.  Approximately 45% of the platted lots in the city are 65 feet wide or less, nearly all are concentrated in the north-central section of the city. (Ord. 1882, Sec. 2, 1995) 
The balance of the lots range from 70 feet widths to more than one acre.  This wide diversity of lot sizes requires two single-family residential districts, R-1a and R-1b.  District R-1a establishes a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet and a minimum of lot width of 80 feet.  District R-1b establishes a minimum lot width of 60 feet and minimum lot area of 6,000 square feet. Additional regulatory procedures set out in the subdivision regulations further control the subdivision and resubdivision of land based upon the character of the surrounding neighborhood. Therefore, lots larger than this minimum will be required in areas where larger lots prevail nearby. 
Districts R-1a and R-1b contain the traditional density standards, front, side and rear yard requirements and other regulatory measures.  New development and redevelopment may, however, achieve needed flexibility by use of planned zoning procedures as set out in Chapter 
19.24. 
It is the purpose and intent of Chapters 19.06 and 19.08 to protect and sustain the property values, 
prevent the decline of physical conditions of private property, prevent conversions of dwellings to 
uses that are not in harmony with the neighborhood and generally assure a quality of life of the 
highest practical order. 
(Ord. 1882, Sec. 2, 1995) 

19.06.010 Use Regulations. 
In District R-1a, no building, structure, land or premises shall be used, and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, altered or converted except for one or more of the following uses: 
A. Single family dwellings; 
B. Golf courses, except for miniature golf and commercial driving ranges; 
C. Publicly owned parks and recreation areas; 
D. Churches and synagogues; 
E. City Hall, police, fire stations; 
F. Publicly owned libraries, museums, art galleries;

E. 	Building Foundations. 
1. 	
New residential structures shall establish the top of foundation between 6 inches and 24 inches above the finished grade along the front facade.  

2. 	
No new residential structure may be built with a top of foundation more than 12 inches higher than the top of foundation of a previous existing home or the height allowed by sub-sections 1., whichever is less. 

3. 	
New residential structures or additions may raise the top of foundation an additional 6 inches for every additional 5 feet over the minimum side setback that the building sets back from both side property lines, up to 36 inches above the finished grade along the front facade. 

4. 	
Any elevation that has more than 24 inches of foundation exposed due to grade changes shall cover the foundation by extending the siding to within 24 inches of finished grade, or by covering the foundation with decorative materials such as stone or brick that compliments the principal materials of the building. 

5. 	
New residential structures or additions not meeting paragraphs 1. through 3. above shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review.  The Planning Commission my grant an exception based on the following criteria: 

a. 	
The design of the building elevations, and, specifically any design details that reduce the scale and massing of the building compared to what could otherwise be built under the zoning standards. 

b. 	
The relationship of the proposed dwelling to existing structures, and whether their grading, elevation and design is appropriate for the context. 

c. 	
Any special considerations of the lot with respect to existing grades, proposed appropriate grades and the drainage patterns in relation to adjacent properties and the proposed structure. (Ord. 2392, Sec. 3, 2018) 




F. 	Exceptions.  The Planning Commission may grant exceptions to the Neighborhood Design Standards in this section 19.08.025 through the site plan review process, based upon the following criteria:  
1. 	
The exception shall only apply to the design standards in this section, and not be granted to allow something that is specifically prohibited in other regulations; 

2. 	
Any exception dealing with the placement of the building is consistent with sound planning, urban design and engineering practices when considering the site and its context within the neighborhood. 

3. 	
The placement and orientation of the main mass, accessory elements, garages and driveways considers the high points and low points of the grade and locates them in such a way to minimize the perceived massing of the building from the streetscape and abutting lots. 

4. 	
Any exception affecting the design and massing of the building is consistent with the common characteristics of the architectural style selected for the building. 

5. 	
The requested exception improves the quality design of the building and site beyond what could be achieved by meeting the standards – primarily considering the character and building styles of the neighborhood and surrounding properties, the integrity of the architectural style of the proposed building and the relationship of the internal functions of the building to the site, streetscape and adjacent property. 

6. 	
The exception will equally or better serve the design objectives stated in Section 


19.08.025 A and the intent stated for the particular standard being altered. (Ord. 2392, Sec 3, 2018)

The C-3 District provides the opportunity to limit the uses permitted at a specific location and the flexibility to change the permitted uses from one location to another.  By specifying the uses permitted in the C-3 District, greater opportunities for redevelopment may be available while at the same time the residential quality of the adjacent areas will be preserved and maintained.  The C-3 District is an applied for district because the uses must be specified and site plan approval is required.  The site plan approval requirement minimizes the undesirable external impacts of a use or uses on surrounding property through the use of performance design standards.

19.23.005 Purpose and Intent 
The zoning of property to the MXD, Planned Mixed Use District, is intended to encourage a variety of land uses in closer proximity to one another than would be possible with more conventional zoning districts, to promote sustainable development with projects that achieve a high level of environmental sensitivity and energy efficiency, to encourage design and construction using Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design “LEED”  principles and practices; and to encourage building configurations that create a distinctive and memorable sense of place. Developments in this district are allowed and expected to have a mixture of residential, office and retail uses in a single structure or multiple structures along with public spaces, entertainment uses, and other specialty facilities that are compatible in both character and function and incorporate a coordinated consistent theme throughout the development. Developments are also expected to utilize shared parking facilities linked to multiple buildings and uses by an attractive and logical pedestrian network that places more emphasis on the quality of the pedestrian experience than is generally found in typical suburban development.  Buildings are intended to be primarily multi-story structures with differing uses organized vertically rather than the horizontal separation of uses that commonly results from conventional zoning districts. 
19.23.010 Use Regulations. 
Permitted uses shall be established in the conditions of the Ordinance governing the particular Mixed Use Development.  Permitted uses may include any uses permitted in any district, uses listed as Special Use Permits, uses listed as Conditional Use Permits, or other uses otherwise not listed that may be compatible with the development.  Each planned mixed use district is encouraged to include a mix of residential, office and commercial uses and those uses shall be listed on the development plan.  After approval of the “MXD” District, uses may be added, changed or deleted by amendment.  The procedure for considering an amendment shall be the same as for the original adoption;

19.24.005 Designation of Equivalent Districts. 
Planned zoning districts and their equivalent districts are as follows: 
Planned District  Equivalent District  
RP-1a Planned Single Family Residential  R-1a  
Rp-1b Planned Single Family Residential  R-1b  
RP-2 Planned Two Family Residential  R-2

CP-1 Planned Restricted Business  C-1  
CP-2 Planned General Business  C-2  

Except in the case of standard single family subdivision, which may be zoned R-1 and areas requested for C-3, all rezoning of land within the City of Prairie Village shall hereafter follow planned zoning procedures as set out in this Chapter. 
19.24.010 Statement of Objectives. 
The zoning of land in Prairie Village to one of the planned districts (RP-1 to CP-2 inclusive) shall be for the purpose of encouraging and requiring orderly development and redevelopment on a quality level generally equal to or exceeding that which prevails in the City of Prairie Village, but permitting deviations from established and customary development techniques.  The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage efficient development and redevelopment of small tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning, conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land.  The following are specific objectives of this section: 
A. 	A proposal to rezone land to a planned district shall be subject to the same criteria relative to compliance with the Prairie Village Comprehensive Plan, land use policies, neighborhood compatibility, adequacy of streets and utilities and other elements, which are established and customary development techniques in this city; 
B. 	The submittal by the developer and the approval by the city of development plans represents a firm commitment by the developers that development will indeed follow the approved plans in such areas as concept, intensity of use, aesthetic levels and quantities of open space;

Chapter 19.24 – Planned Zoning District 
C. 	Deviations in yard requirements, setbacks and relationship between buildings as set out in Standards of Development in Section 19.24.015 of this Chapter, may be approved by the Planning Commission and City Council if it is deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the extent that an equal or higher quality of development will be produced; 
D. 	Residential areas are to be planned and developed in a manner that will produce more usable open space, better recreational opportunities, safer and more attractive neighborhoods than under standard zoning and development techniques; 
E. 	Commercial areas are to be planned and developed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares.  Control of vehicular access, circulation, architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to assure minimum adverse effects on street system and other services of the community; 
F. 	The developer will be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land not feasible under application of standard zoning requirements; 
G. 	Planned zoning shall not be used as a refuge from the standard requirements of the zoning district as to intensity of land use, amount of open space or other established development criteria; 
H. 	Any building or portion thereof may be owned in condominium under K.S.A. 53-3101; 
I. 	For purposes of this Chapter, the terms "Shopping Center", "Business Park," "Office Park," or other grouping of buildings shall mean development that were planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the zoning was approved by the City.  The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt the project or any portion thereof from complying with development standards that were committed at the time of zoning. 
19.24.015 Standards of Development 
A. 	The maximum height of buildings and structures shall be as set out in the standard requirements of the equivalent district. 
B. 	The intensity of land use, bulk of buildings, the concentration of population, the amount of open space, light and sir, shall be generally equal to that required in the equivalent district. 
C. 	The density of residential dwelling units, the parking requirements and the performance standards shall be the same as in the equivalent district. 
D. 	The permitted uses shall be the same as those permitted in the equivalent district provided that limitation may be placed on the occupancy of certain premises, if such limitation is deemed essential to the health, safety or general welfare of the community. 
E. 	The Planning Commission may require assurance of the financial and administrative ability of any agency created by a developer for the purpose of maintaining common open space and facilities of a nonpublic nature. 
F. 	The Planning Commission and City Council may, in the process of approving preliminary and final plans, approve deviations from the standard requirements as follows, provided any deviation so approved shall be in keeping with accepted land planning principles and must be clearly set out in the minutes as well as on exhibits in the record: 
1. 	
Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a public street may be reduced to fifty percent of the standard requirement; 

2. 	
Setbacks of buildings from a property line other than a public street, may be reduced to sixty percent of the standard requirement and setbacks of paved areas

adjacent to property lines, other than street lines, to zero if existing or proposed 
development on said adjacent land justifies the same; 
Side yards between buildings may be reduced to zero; 

3. 	The foregoing Deviations 1 through 4 may be granted by the Planning Commission and City Council only when compensating open space is provided elsewhere in the project, where there is ample evidence that said deviation will not adversely affect neighboring property nor will it constitute the mere granting of a privilege.

19.28.005 General. 
Special uses are those types of uses which, due to their nature, are dissimilar to the normal uses permitted within a given zoning district or where product, process, mode of operation, or nature of business or activity may be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property values of the immediate neighborhood and its environs unless it is designed in a manner that is compatible with surrounding properties.  Within the various zoning districts, specific uses may be permitted only after additional requirements are complied with as established within this section.  In no event shall a Special Use Permit be granted where the Special Use contemplated is not specifically listed as a Special Use in the Zoning Regulations. 
19.28.010 Application. 
A special use permit application shall be initiated by the owner of the property affected.  If such application is made by the owner's agent, said agent shall enter upon the application the name and current mailing address of the owners.  If the property is under contract or option to purchase, the name and current mailing address of the purchaser shall also be shown on the application. All applications shall be made on forms prescribed by the City Planning Commission and duly filed with the City Clerk or their designee. (Ord. 2199, Sec. V, 2009) 
19.28.015 Filing Fee. 
A fee as established by the City Council shall accompany each application for a Special Use Permit.  In addition, the applicant is obligated to pay all costs incurred by the City, including

publication costs, consultant's charges for application review, if necessary, court reporter costs, costs of the original transcript of the hearing of the Planning Commission and as many copies of the transcript as necessary. Simultaneously with the payment of the filing fee, the applicant shall accompany each application with a cost advance as specified by the City Council to be used by the City to pay for said costs.  If the costs are less than the stipulated cost advance, the City shall refund the difference to the applicant. If the costs are more than the stipulated cost advance, the City shall so notify the applicant who is obligated to pay such excesses forthwith. 
19.28.020 Public Hearing Notice. 
All such applications shall be scheduled for hearing not later than the second regular monthly meeting of the Planning Commission following the date of the earliest publication period available as required by law.  Any such hearing may, for good cause, in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be continued for a definite time to be specified in the record of the Commission.  Notice of such hearing shall be published in one issue of the official newspaper of Prairie Village, such notice to be published not less than twenty (20) days or more than forty (40) days, exclusive of the days of the publication and hearing, prior to the date of said hearing before the Commission.  The application area shall be designated by legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration.  If a general description is used, said notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available.  In addition to such publication, the applicant shall be responsible for mailing notice of such proposed special use permit to all the owners of lands located within two hundred feet, except public streets and ways, of the application area at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing, thus providing an opportunity to all interested parties to be heard.  Such mailed notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be in the form of a letter describing the proposed special use. A copy of the publication notice shall be included and such mailed notices shall be addressed to the owners of land mentioned above and not to non-owner occupants.  Failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken.  The applicant shall file with the City Clerk or their designee, not less than six (6) days prior to the date of the hearing, an affidavit to the effect that such notices were indeed mailed in compliance with this title. 
In the case of an application for a special use which may, in the opinion of the Commission or Governing Body, substantially change traffic patterns, or create traffic congestion, either body may, by motion, require that the applicant procure the services of a competent professional traffic engineer for the purpose of preparing a traffic study.  Such study shall show whether or not the traffic generated by the proposed development will be handled on the site in an orderly and efficient manner and that vehicular ingress and egress from the site onto public streets will function in an orderly and efficient manner. (Ord. 2199, Sec. V, 2009)

Chapter 19.28 – Special Use Permits 
giving access to it are such that the special use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to hinder development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations.  In determining whether the special use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood consideration shall be given to: 
1. 	
The location, size, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls, and fences on the site; and 

2. 	
The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.

I. 	Architectural style and exterior materials are compatible with such style and materials used in the neighborhood in which the proposed building is to be built or located. 
It is not necessary that a finding of fact be made for each factor described herein.  However, there should be a conclusion that the request should be approved or denied based upon consideration of as many factors as are applicable. (Ord. 1973, Sec. I, 1999) 
19.28.040 Planning Commission Action. 
After the public hearing, the Planning Commission, by a majority of members present and voting, shall be required to recommend approval, approval subject to conditions, or denial of the special use permit to the Governing Body.  If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation it shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.  The Planning Commission shall submit its recommendation and the reasons therefore to the Governing Body. (Ord. 2199, Sec. V, 2009) 
19.28.041 Protest. 
Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission recommends approval or disapproval of a Special Use Permit, if a valid protest petition against such Special Use Permit is filed in the Office of the City Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing, signed by the owners of record of 20% or more of the total area required to be notified of the proposed Special Use Permit, excluding streets and public ways, such Special Use Permit shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote (10 votes) of all members of the Governing Body. 
Valid Protest Petitions must be signed and acknowledged by each and every owner(s) of property protesting a given action. The word “owner(s)” for purposes of protest petitions shall include all those individuals that may have ownership in subject real property or property within the notification area.  If the property is owned by joint tenancy, all such owners must sign the petition by their own hand to be valid, unless the petition itself clearly indicates that one tenant has the legal authority to sign for and on behalf of the other.  In the event a corporation, partnership or other organization meets the requirements to protest an action and desires to sign a petition, the following must appear on the petitions for such an organization to be counted with the petition: a) the proper name in which title to their property is held; and b) the address of their property; and c)

Upon the receipt of any such recommendation, the Governing Body may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by a simple majority (7 votes) thereof or it need take no further action. (Ord. 2199, Sec. V, 2009) 
19.28.050 Conditions of Approval. 
In granting a Special Use Permit, the Planning Commission and Governing Body may impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefited by the special use as may be necessary to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such special uses upon other property in the neighborhood, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations. (Ord. 2199, Sec. V, 2009)

19.33.005 Intent. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 grants authority to local jurisdictions over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae. As the City has diverse and unique landscapes that perpetuate the identity of its residential neighborhoods, protection of these valuable resources is paramount. Accordingly, the Governing Body finds that the unregulated placement and design of wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae results in visual clutter that adversely affects community aesthetics and damages the character of the City. This ordinance is intended to provide minimum standards that ensure that the wireless communication needs of residents and businesses are met, while at the same time the general safety and welfare of the community is protected. (Ord. 2189, Sec. II, 2009) 
19.33.010 Purpose. 
A wireless communication facility, tower or antenna including its equipment, but excluding small wireless communication antennae as setout in Section 19.33.055 may be sited, constructed, designed or maintained provided that it is in conformance with the stated standards, procedures, and other requirements of this ordinance.  More specifically, these regulations are necessary to: 
A. 	Provide for suitable location of wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae so as to mitigate their negative effect on residential neighborhoods and land uses; 
B. 	Maintain community aesthetics by minimizing the negative visual effects of wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae through specific design and siting criteria; 
C. 	Maximize the use of existing towers and alternative tower structures so as to minimize the need for new tower locations; 
D. 	Examine co-location among wireless service providers on existing and newly constructed sites in order to reduce the overall number of towers needed; and 
E. 	Promote the use of innovative stealth, camouflage and disguise techniques for wireless communication facilities, towers, and antennae so as to integrate their appearance with the many architectural and natural themes found throughout the City.

C. 	Nonconforming Use.  An existing use of a structure or of land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located. 
19.40.010 Nonconforming Lots of Record.   
A Building Permit may be issued for any nonconforming lot of record provided that: 
A. 	Said lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations; and 
B. 	Said lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by any zoning regulations; and 
C. 	Said lot can meet all yard regulations for the district in which it is located.

To enhance the quality of appearance of developed land use. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 


B. 	Design 
1. 	
Appearance – Those fences which have surface material, whether it be wood, chain link, metal bars or other permitted material, attached on one side of posts and/or rails, thus producing a finished side and an unfinished side, shall be installed with the finished sides exposed toward the street and adjacent properties. When doubt exists as to which way the surface of the proposed fence shall face, the Building Official shall make the final determination. 

2. 	
Prohibited Fences – The installation of farm type fences such as barbed wire, high tensile wire, wire mesh, welded wire, woven wire, pipe and cable, electric and razor ribbon fences or any similar type fence shall be prohibited. 

3. 	
Height – No fence shall exceed six (6) feet in height except tennis court enclosures which may not exceed twelve (12) feet in height and except fences which are located within the building envelope of a lot shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height. The height of the fence shall be deemed to be the average distance from the finished grade to the highest point on the fence panel, excluding posts which may project above the fence panel not more than eight (8) inches. Where the terrain is not level, the average dimension may, at the discretion of the Building Official, be applied to each eight (8) foot section of the fence. Fences built in combination with retaining walls and/or berms shall be measured from the finished grade on the high side of the wall. In addition, fences and walls built on slopes shall comply with the required height measurement along the line of the fence location. 

4. 	
Decorative Fences – Decorative fences shall be designed so that they are at least 50% open and do not exceed two and a half (2 ½) feet in height. Split rail and wrought iron fences are examples of this type of fence. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 


C. 	Location

(10) feet from a street right-of-way line. 
2. 	
Fences, other than decorative fences, shall not be located in the front yard and may be attached to or extended from the front corner of the dwelling. 

3. 	
Fences located on the side street of a corner lot shall not be less than five (5) feet from the right-of-way line except that if an adjacent lot faces the side street, the fence shall be setback from the right-of-way line a distance of fifteen (15) feet or not less than one-half the depth of the front yard of an adjacent building, whichever is the greater setback. 

4. 	
If the rear of a through lot is fenced, a gate shall be installed to provide access to the right-of-way. 

5. 	
Diagrams depicting the location of fences on various types of lots are attached. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 


D. 	Retaining Walls 
1. 	Retaining walls shall be designed and constructed to support lateral loads.

Said plans shall be reviewed prior to the issuance of a building permit. Retaining walls shall setback a minimum of two (2) feet from side and rear 
19.44 - 3 

Chapter 19.44 – Height and Area Exceptions 
property lines, and retaining walls exceeding six (6) feet in height shall be required to be setback from side and rear property lines an additional one (1) foot for each two (2) feet, or part thereof, in excess of six (6) feet in height, e.g. a ten (10) foot high retaining wall would be required to set back a minimum of four (4) feet from the property line. Allowances will be made for tie backs to existing grade.  Diagrams depicting the location of retaining walls on various types of situations are attached.  Any exceptions or deviations from this formula shall require site plan approval by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 
E. 	Drainage and Utility Easements 
1. 	
Fences and walls shall not restrict natural surface drainage nor be constructed to divert or channel water flow with increased velocity. Fences shall not be constructed in drainage easements if they affect the flow of storm water. 

2. 	
Fences installed in a utility easement may need to be removed in order to access the utilities. Fences constructed in easements are at the risk of the owner and shall not be the responsibility of the utility or city to replace them. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 


F. 	Permits Required 
1. 	
All fences, and retaining walls as defined herein, unless otherwise excepted, shall require a building permit. No fence may be erected, constructed or replaced until said permit has been procured from the Building Official. The Building Official may allow minor deviations and adjustments relative to the dimensions set out in this section where topographic or other natural features, utility locations, meters, trees or other conditions so warrant and where the spirit and intent of this section will be preserved. 

2. 	
Enclosures erected around compost piles in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter 15. Article 3 of the City Code are excluded from these regulations and shall not require a permit. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006) 


G. 	Site Plan Approval 
1. 	
As a part of the site plan approval process as set out in Section 19.32 Site Plan Approval, the Planning Commission may approve solid walls or make adjustments to the height and location of fences, solid walls and retaining walls provided that it results in a project that is more compatible, provides better screening, provides better storm drainage management, or provides a more appropriate utilization of the site. 

2. 	
An application may be made to the Planning Commission for site plan approval of a solid wall, retaining wall or a fence that is unique and does not have the locational or design characteristics set out in these regulations. (Ord. 2117, Sec. 2, 2006; Ord. 2248, Sec. 2, 2011)

L. 	Temporary Signs. 
1. 	Purpose and Findings. The City of Prairie Village is enacting this Ordinance to establish reasonable regulations for the posting of informational signs on public and private property.
  Temporary Signs left completely unregulated, can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values as an aesthetic nuisance. 
By implementing these regulations, the City intends to: 
Revised 12/4/2L:\CD\PLAN_COM\Zoning Regulations\CURRENT CODE\Chapter 19.48.doc 19.48 - 5 
a. 	
balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through temporary signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 

b. 	
further the objectives of the City’s comprehensive plan; 

c. 	
protect the public health, safety and welfare; 

d. 	
reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 

e. 	
protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 

f. 	
promote economic development; and 

g. 	
ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of the temporary sign regulations specified in the following. 


2. 	Regulations: Temporary signs may be posted on property in all Zoning Districts of the City, subject to the following requirements: 
a. 	
The total square footage for temporary signs in any district, in the aggregate, shall not exceed forty-eight (48) square feet, with no individual sign exceeding sixteen (16) square feet. The total square footage of a sign is measured to include all of the visible display area of only one side of the sign and only the area of one side of a double sided sign is included in the aggregate calculation. 

b. 	
Signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height measured from the average grade at the base of the sign. 

c. 	
No sign shall obstruct or impair access to a public sidewalk, public or private street or driveway, traffic control sign, bus stop, fire hydrant, or any other type of street furniture, or otherwise create a hazard, including a tripping hazard. 

d. 	
No sign shall be illuminated or painted with light-reflecting paint. 

e. 	
A sign shall only be posted with the consent of the property owner or occupant. Signs posted in the public right-of-way may only be posted with the permission of the abutting property owner.

g. 	
Signs shall not be posted on trees, utility poles, and other similar structures within the rights-of-way. 


3. 	Removal or Replacement of Informational Signs: 
a. 	
The person who has posted or directed the posting of the sign is responsible for the removal or replacement of that sign. 

b. 	
If that person does not remove or replace the sign in accordance with these regulations, then the property owner or occupant of the building or lot where the sign is posted is responsible for the sign’s removal or replacement. 

c. 	
“If the Building Official finds that any sign is posted in violation of these regulations on public property, the Building Official is authorized to remove any such signs. If the Building Official finds that any sign posted in violation of these regulations on private property, (s)he shall give written notice to the person who has posted or directed the posting of the sign.  If that person fails to remove or replace the sign so as to comply with the standards herein set forth within seventy-two (72) hours after such notice, such sign may be removed by the Building Official.” 


(Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 
M. 	Monument Signs: Monument signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height above the average grade of the base; shall not exceed twenty (20) square feet in area per face; shall be placed on private property, not closer than three feet to the property line or 12 feet from the back of curb of the street and shall be landscaped at the base.

 CITY OF PRAIRIE VILLAGE – ZONING REGULATIONS 
Chapter 19.48 – Signs 
permanent building materials that are similar to or complement existing building materials and colors used on the buildings located on the site.  If the sign is not located within the landscape setback area, the sign base shall be located with a landscaped area extending a minimum of three 
(3) feet on all sides of the sign base and a landscape plan shall be submitted for approval. All monument signs including the landscape plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission based on the above requirements prior to obtaining a permit and being installed. (Ord. 2004, Sec. II, 2001; Ord. 2068, Sec. II, 2004; Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 
N. 	Sign Area Calculations. 
1. 	
Monument Signs:  The area shall include the sign panel but not the sign base on which it is mounted or the structural elements or frames that form the perimeter of the panel. 

2. 	
Wall Signs: If the wall sign is contained within a panel, the sign area calculation shall be the area of the panel.  If the sign consists of individual letter, symbols or words, either painted or mounted on the wall, the area shall be the smallest rectangular figure that can encompass all of the letters, words, logos or symbols. 

3. 	
Band Signs:  The area of a band sign shall be the width of the band times the outside 


extremities of the letters, words, logos or symbols contained within the band. (Ord. 2004, Sec. II, 2001; Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 
O. 	Setback: All signs shall setback a minimum of twelve (12) feet from the back of curb and five (5) feet from any adjacent side or rear property line. (Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 
P. 	Obscene Materials: Obscene signs, flags, banners, or any sign of any type are prohibited. “Obscene” is defined as any material that (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; 
(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically 
defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious 
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
(Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 

Q. 	Substitution of Messages:  Subject to the landowner’s consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided that the Sign or Sign Structure is legal without consideration of message content.  This substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel or land use, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.  This provision does not allow for the substitution of an offsite commercial message in place of an onsite commercial message. (Ord. 2138, Sec. II, 2006) 
19.48.020 Regulations Applicable to Districts R-1a through R-4 Inclusive. 
No sign may be constructed, erected, or displayed in districts zoned R-1a through R-4 inclusive, except as provided in the Section 19.48.020.

1. 	Churches, synagogues, private or public schools, community center buildings, libraries, art galleries, and museums shall be allowed not more than two (2) signs identifying the premises and activities provided therein.  Such signs may either be wall mounted or 
Revised 12/4/2L:\CD\PLAN_COM\Zoning Regulations\CURRENT CODE\Chapter 19.48.doc 19.48 - 7

Wall signs shall not exceed five (5) percent of the total area of the facade of the building, on which it is attached and in no event shall exceed fifty (50) square feet in area.  Such signs shall be of a design, location and size as to be in harmony with the neighborhood and the building served as determined by the Building Official.

CHAPTER 19.50 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SYSTEMS 
Sections: 
19.50.005 Purpose. 
19.50.010 Solar Energy. 
19.50.015 Wind Energy. 
19.50.020 Geothermal Energy. 
19.50.025 Hybrid Energy. 
19.50.005 Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish for the residents of the City of Prairie Village a provision for using an alternate sources of energy apart from the prevailing energy sources of natural gas and electricity—in this case, solar, wind and geothermal energy. The City, by this chapter, establishes that the use of alternative energy systems is in the general welfare of its residents in that its use will help alleviate the use of depreciating energy resources and thereby will lessen the city's reliance on increasingly uncertain power resources. The use of alternative energy systems is, therefore, valid public purpose. (Ord. 2250, Sec. II, 2012) 
19.50.010 Solar Energy – The following regulations shall apply to solar energy installations: 
A. Related Ordinances All other ordinances of the municipal code are applicable to this section, including, but not limited to building setbacks, yard requirements, and height restrictions. (Ord. 2250, Sec. II, 2012) 
B. Definitions 
1. 	
“Solar access” means access to the envelope of air space exposed to the face of any solar energy system through which the sun passes and which allows the solar energy system to function. Such access is necessary to any solar energy system. 

2.
  "Solar air space envelope" means that volume of air space whose lower limits are defined by a plane sloping upward to the south at an angle of twenty-two (22) degrees from the horizontal plane, measured form the bottom of the solar collector system and whose lateral limits are defined by planes which correspond to the direct rays of the sun on each end (east and west) of the solar collector system at 0900 and 1600 solar time from September 21 through April 21.

 3.
 "Solar collector" means both passive and active systems. An active collector shall include panels designed to collect and transfer solar energy into heated water, air or electricity. Passive collectors shall include windows and window walls, which admit solar rays to obtain direct heat or to obtain heat for storage. Such windows and window walls of passive systems may extend to ground level. Greenhouses, atriums, and solariums are included in this definition. 

4.
 "Solar easement" means an easement arising by agreement between property owners and establishing the solar air space envelope within which building and vegetation obstructions are prohibited. (Ord. 2250, Sec. II, 2012) 


C. Solar Easements. 
In order to preserve and protect the solar access across contiguous or nearby property, "solar annotated easements" may be formulated. Such easements shall establish the solar air space envelope within which building and vegetation obstructions are prohibited.

CITY OF PRAIRIE VILLAGE – ZONING REGULATIONS 
Chapter 19.50 – Alternative Energy Systems 
Solar easements are allowed by Kansas Statutes Annotated 58-3801 - "Creation of Solar Easements; Recordation" and 58-3802 - "Same; Content." A property owner who wishes to construct a solar energy system may enter into a solar easement agreement with another property owner whose property contains an obstruction to solar access. Under this agreement the latter property owner may agree to remove existing vegetation or structures which block solar access to the solar energy system. The City of Prairie Village shall also be included as a property owner wherein property owned by the City may be located in a solar air space envelope and the city, therefore, may be a party to such an easement. All easements shall be recorded by the Johnson County Register of Deeds and shall transfer from one owner to another if the property is sold. All such easements shall also be filed with the Building Official for coordinating issuance of future building permits, which might be affected by the easement.  (Ord. 2250, Sec. II, 2012) 
D. 	Compatibility. The design of any solar system, active or passive, shall generally be compatible with the architectural design of the surrounding neighborhood as follows, whether or not the solar energy system is the subject of a solar easement. 
1. 	
Any solar energy system incorporated into residential facility shall be integrated into the basic form and main structure of the residence. All active systems shall be roof mounted with the collector panels integrated into the roof either directly mounted against the roof or integrated into the roof so that they form a part of the roof itself. Mounting arrangements, which allow the collectors to project above the roof line, such as "standoff" or "rack" mounting arrangements are not allowed. 

2. 	
Any system incorporated into a commercial building or a nonresidential building or structure in a residentially zoned district shall be integrated into the basic form and main body of the building. If roof mounted, all collector panels shall fit into the form of the roof; if the building's roof is sloped or if "rack" mounting is used on a flat roof, the mounting must be concealed from view at street level. Exposed rack supports and ground mounted installations apart from the main building are not permitted. 

3.
 Roof mounted solar energy systems mounted on "accessory or detached buildings" are allowed on detached garages, carports, swimming pool equipment buildings and other similar structures. Detached "greenhouses" are also acceptable. All such energy systems mounted on accessory or detached buildings shall conform to the requirements outlined in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above. No ground mounted installations or panel racks shall be allowed except as set out in Section 19.50.030.E. 

4. 
In an active or photovoltaic system, all components servicing the collector panels shall be concealed including mechanical piping, electrical conduits, etc. 

5. 
All exposed metal, including the frame work of active collector panels or exposed mullions and framework of passive systems shall be of finished warm earth tones, or black, in color. Clear unpainted aluminum shall not be allowed. (Ord. 2250, Sec. II, 2012)

19.52.015 Public Hearing. 
All such applications shall be scheduled for hearing not later than the second regular monthly meeting of the Planning Commission following the date of the earliest publication period available as required by law.  Any such hearing may, for good cause, in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be continued for a definite time to be specified in the record of the Commission.  Notice of such hearing shall be published in one issue of the official newspaper of Prairie Village, such notice to be published not less than twenty (20) days exclusive of the days of the publication and hearing, prior to the date of said hearing before the Commission.  The application area shall be designated by legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration.  If a general description is used, said notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available.  In addition to such publication, the applicant shall be responsible for mailing notice of such proposed change to all the owners of lands located within two hundred (200) feet, except public streets and ways, of the area proposed to be rezoned at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing, thus providing an opportunity to all interested parties to be heard.  Such mailed notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be in the form of a letter explaining the proposed change.  A copy of the publication notice shall be included and such mailed notices shall be addressed to the owners of land mentioned above and not to non-owner occupants.

(Ord. 2199, Sec. III, 2009) 
19.52.020 Traffic Study Requirement. 
In the case of an application for rezoning of land for a use which may, in the opinion of the Commission or Governing body, substantially change traffic patterns, or create traffic congestion, either body may, by motion, require that the applicant procure the services of a competent professional traffic engineer for the purpose of preparing a traffic study.  Such study shall show whether or not the traffic generated by the proposed development will be handled on the site in an orderly and efficient manner and that vehicular ingress and egress from the site onto public streets will function in an orderly and efficient manner. 
19.52.025 Posting of Property. 
Each applicant for rezoning; within forty-eight (48) hours of filing such application, place a sign upon the lot, tract or parcel for which the application was filed.

CITY OF PRAIRIE VILLAGE – ZONING REGULATIONS 
Chapter 19.52 – Procedural Provisions 
Said sign shall be maintained and kept in place by the applicant until the conclusion of the public hearing before the Planning Commission, or until withdrawal of the application, at which time the sign shall be removed by the applicant. The applicant shall file an affidavit at the time of said public hearing before the Planning Commission that the sign was placed and maintained to said hearing date as required by this title.  No application shall be heard by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body unless such affidavit has been filed. 
The bottom of said sign shall be a minimum of two feet above the ground line. Said sign shall be placed within five (5) feet of the street right-of-way line, in a central position on such lot, tract or parcel of land and shall have no visual obstructions thereto.  If the lot, tract or parcel of land has more than one street abutting thereto, the sign shall face the street with the greatest traffic flow. If the lot, tract, or parcel of land is larger than five (5) acres, a sign as required by this title shall be placed so as to face each of the streets abutting thereto. 
It is a misdemeanor for any person to remove, deface or destroy any sign provided for by this title. Any person, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined a sum not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100), or imprisoned in jail for not more than thirty (30) days or be both so fined and imprisoned. 
19.52.030 Factors. 
The factors to be considered in approving or disapproving a zoning request shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1. 	
The character of the neighborhood; 

2. 	
The zoning and uses of property nearby; 

3. 	
The suitability of the property for the uses to which it has been restricted under its existing zoning; 

4. 	
The extent that a change will detrimentally affect neighboring property; 

5. 	
The length of time of any vacancy of the property; 

6. 	
The relative gain to public health, safety and welfare by destruction of value of the applicant's property as compared to the hardship on other individual landowners; 

7. 	
City staff recommendations; and 

8. 	
Conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. 


19.52.035 Planning Commission Action. 
After the public hearing, the Planning Commission, by a majority of members present and voting, 
shall be required to recommend approval or denial of the amendment to the Governing Body.  If 
the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, it shall be 
deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.  The Planning Commission shall submit 
its recommendation, and the reasons therefore, to the Governing Body. 
(Ord. 2199, Sec. III, 2009) 

19.52.040 Governing Body Action. 
After receipt of the Planning Commission's recommendations of any such amendment, the Governing Body may: 
1. 	
Adopt such recommendation by a simple majority (7 votes) and if it is to approve a change, adopt an ordinance to that effect; 

2. 	
Override such recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body (9 votes) and if it is to approve a change, adopt an ordinance to that effect; or

CITY OF PRAIRIE VILLAGE – ZONING REGULATIONS 
Chapter 19.52 – Procedural Provisions 
3. 	Return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body’s failure to approve or disapprove by a simple majority of the quorum present. 
If the Governing Body returns the recommendations, the Planning Commission may resubmit its original recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit a new and amended recommendation.  If the Planning Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the Governing Body following the Planning Commission's next regular meeting, such inaction shall be deemed a resubmission of the original recommendation.  Upon the receipt of any such recommendation, the Governing Body may adopt or it may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by a simple majority (7 votes) thereof or it need take no further action. 
19.52.045 Protest. 
Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a zoning amendment, if a protest petition against such amendment is filed in the Office of the City Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of record of 20% or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of 20% or more of the total area required to be notified of the proposed rezoning of specific property, excluding streets and public ways, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all members of the Governing Body (10 votes). (Ord. 2199, Sec. III, 2009) 
19.52.050 Lesser Districts. 
The Planning Commission may recommend a lesser change than that requested.  Lesser change is deemed to be a more restrictive change.  The restrictiveness of the zoning classifications in this code and title are established in the following descending order from most restrictive to least restrictive: 
1. 	
R-1a & RP-1a Most restrictive 

2. 	
R-1b & RP-1b 

3. 	
R-2 & RP-2 

4. 	
R-3 & RP-3 

5. 	
R-4 & RP-4 

6. 	
C-3 

7. 	
C-0 & CP-0 

8. 	
C-1 & CP-1 

9. 	
C-2 & CP-2 


19.52.055 Reapplication Waiting Period 
In the case of denial of an application by the Governing Body, the applicant must wait a period of six (6) months from the date of denial before reapplying for approval of a Special Use Permit unless the legal description of the property has substantially changed or the new application is for a Special Use Permit that is a different use than the original. 
The City Administrator, or his/her designee, shall determine if an application concerns "substantially the same" property, development and land use as a prior application. The landowner may appeal such determination to the Planning Commission. 
The Governing Body may waive the waiting period for good cause shown. (Ord. 2307, Sec. II, 2014)

Such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by this title in such district.  A request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the Board that all of the following conditions have been met: 
A. 	That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant;

C. 	That the strict application of the provisions of these regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application; 
D. 	That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare; and 
E. 	That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of these regulations.

Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider. 
Proposed streets must conform to existing topography as nearly as possible, in order that drainage problems may be addressed. Streets should be related to valleys so as to form a collection system for surface water. 
Local streets may be so planned as to discourage their use by non-local traffic. Consideration shall be given to the existing street arrangement in adjacent developed areas and to any proposed street arrangement in adjacent undeveloped areas to the end that local traffic will have convenient and safe access to the traffic arterial system. 
18.04.020 Street Arrangements-Plan Submittal 
A. 	The applicant shall furnish one copy of the city zoning map on which (s)he shall indicate in color the following information: 
CITYOF PRAIRIEVILLAGE REGULATIONS

-SUBDIVISION 
Chapter 18.04 -Subdivision Streets and Other Features- Standards 
1. 	
The general details and land use of the proposed project; 

2. 	
The location of existing and planned location of arterial streets within one mile of the proposed project; 

3. 	
The location of existing and planned schools, public, private and parochial; 

4. 	
The location of existing and planned public parks. 


B. 	The sites for parks, schools, playgrounds and other public facilities shown on or recommended by the City Comprehensive Plan or proposed for such use by the subdivider should be carefully studied and consideration given as to when and in what manner such areas will be acquired by public authorities. 
18.04.030 Block Length 
In general, intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets or customary subdivision practices in the neighborhood. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential districts shall normally not exceed 1,800 feet in length; except that in outlying subdivisions a greater length may be permitted where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 1,000 feet, pedestrian ways through the block may be required near the center of the block. Such pedestrian ways shall have a minimum width of ten feet, shall be dedicated and shall contain a minimum five foot wide sidewalk. The pedestrian way shall be fenced on both sides with a four-foot chain link, or equivalent, fence through the middle of the block from front building line to front building line. Streets with reverse curves should have a tangent between curves of a length in relation to the radii of the curves. 
18.04.040 Block Width 
The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, provided that where lots back or side upon arterial routes, vehicular access from said lots to the arterial route shall be prohibited. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such widths as may be considered most suitable for their prospective uses, including adequate space for off-street parking, loading space and deliveries. 
18.04.050 Intersections 
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. Any street that does not approach an intersecting street at a right angle should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet from such intersection. Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission as recommended by the Director of Public Works. 
CITYOF PRAIRIE -SUBDIVISION
Cliapter 18.04 -Subdivision Streets aird Other Features- Standards 
Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practical, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect arterial or collector streets, their alignment shall be continuous unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission as recommended by the Director of Public Works. 
18.04.060 Cul-de-sacs and Loop Streets 
Cul-de-sacs shall provide proper access to all lots and shall generally not exceed 500 feet in length, and a landscaped turnaround shall be provided at the closed end, with a vertical curb on the inside diameter of a minimum 40 feet and an outside gutter with a minimum diameter of 80 feet. The use of loop streets is encouraged. 
18.04.070 Dead-end Streets 
Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided to connect with future streets in adjacent lands. Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, provision must be made for the extension of existing dead-end streets including the removal of the cul-de-sac. 
18.04.080 Of-street Parking and Loading 
Except in unusual cases, off-street parking and loading courts must be provided in business 
blocks. 

18.04.090 Lot Size 
A. 	In reviewing a subdivision plat for approval, the Planning Commission shall give due 
consideration to the following factors and conditions: 

1. 	
The size of the lots which currently abut the proposed subdivision; 

2. 	
The average size of lots which are within 300 feet of the proposed subdivision; 

3. 	
The fact that the width of the lot is more perceptive and impacts privacy more than the depth or the area of the lot; 

4.

18.14.010 Improvement Completion and lmprovement Agreement 
A. 	Completion of lmprovements. Before the final subdivision plat is signed by the City, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the approved construction drawings and to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director, all the street, sidewalks, drainage and other public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in by the City, specified in the Final Plat and as approved by the Planning Commission, and to dedicate those public improvements to the City of Prairie Village, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the dedicated property and public improvements. 
B. 	Subdivision lmprovement Agreement and Guarantee. 
1. 	
Agreement. The City Council in its sole discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to the signing of the Final Plat and, as an alternative, permit the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public improvements no later than two (2) years following the date of the approval of the improvement agreement. The applicant covenant shall warrant that all required public improvements will be free from defect for a period of two (2) years following the acceptance by the City Council. The subdivision improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant and the City Council. 

2. 	
Covenants to Run. The subdivision improvement agreement shall provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land and bind all successors, heirs, and assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision improvement agreement will be adopted by the City Council and shall be recorded in the Office of the Johnson County Register of Deeds. 

3. 	
Security. Whenever the City Council permits an applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide a cash escrow as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. The security shall be in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated 


Cln OF PRAIRIEVILLAGE-SUBDIVISIONREGULATIONS 
Chapter 18.14 -hnprovernent Procedures 
cost of completion of the required public improvements, including lot improvements, as prepared by the applicant and approved by the Director of Public Works. 
a. 	Cash Escrow. The escrow instructions shall provide: (1) that the subdivider will have no right to a return of any of the funds and (2) that the escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the City whenever the City Attorney presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the City's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right. 
If and when the City Council accepts the offer of dedication for the last completed required public improvement, the City Council shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but twenty-five percent (25%) of the funds represented by the cash escrow if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the subdivider's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements are free from defect. 
C. 	Temporary Improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the Planning Commission and shall maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by these regulations. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City Council a separate subdivision improvement agreement and cash escrow in an appropriate amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and escrow shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
D. 	Costs of Improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the developer, at its expense, without reimbursement by the local government or any improvement district except that, as is allowed under state law, the developer may fonn or cause to be formed a benefit district or districts to construct and finance the construction of required public improvements excluding lot improvements on individual lots. If the subdivider does form or cause to be formed a benefit district for the purposes identified in this section, the City Council shall not release the subdivider from its obligations under any improvement agreement nor shall the City Council release any security, in whole or in part, until the benefit district has sold bonds or otherwise certifies to the City Council that it has an absolute right to raise revenues sufficient to construct, maintain, and warrant the quality of the required public improvements. 
E. 	Failure to Complete Improvements. For subdivisions for which no subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within one year of the date of approval of the Final Plat, the Final Plat approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and required
