As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
A. "Harmful to minors" includes any material or performance, whether
through pictures, photographs, drawings, writings, cartoons, recordings,
telephonic transmissions, films, video tapes or other such mediwn, which
shall be "harmful to minors" if the following apply:
1. The average person applying contemporary community
standards would find that the material or performance,
taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest of
minors in sex .
2. The material or per formance depicts or describes sexually
expl icit nudity, sexual conduct, sadomasochistic
sexual abuse or lewd exhibition of the genitals, in a
way which is patently offensive to prevailing standards
in the adult community with respect to what is suitable
for minors.
3. The material or performance,
serious literary, artistic,
value for minors.
taken as

C. "Person" means any individual, corporation, cooperative, company,
partnership, firm, association , joint venture, business, establishment,
organization or other legal entity of any ki nd.
D. "Prurient" means a lascivious, unhealthy , degrading, shameful , or morbid
interest in sexual conduct, sexually explicit nudity , sadomasochistic

have a tendency to excite lascivious thought or desires or when they are
designed , marketed, promoted or disseminated to cater or appeal to such
an interest. Whe re the material or performance is designed for and
primarily disseminated or promoted to a clearly defined deviant sexual
group, rather t han the public at large , the prurient-appeal requirement
is satisfied if the dominant theme 0£ material or performance, taken as
a whole, appeals to t he prurient interest in sex of the members of that
intended and probable recipient group.

The following monthly rates and charges which the City Council hereby finds and
declares are fair, reasonable and necessary minimum rates be, and they are
hereby, fixed as rates to be charged for water services to be rendered by the
System.
A) Revenues collected as a result of User Rates levied shall be deposited in
non-l apsing funds known as the Revenue and Operating Fund and the Emergency
Equipment Replacement Fund. Fiscal year-end balances in these funds shall
be used for no other purposes than the operation and mainte nance of the
Jacksonville Water Commission.
B) All customers of the Jacksonville Water Commission shal l be billed on a
monthly basis. Monthly user fees assessed for each customer shall be
determined each month on the basis of the following rate and calendar year
schedule:
168
No more than one residential unit or one commercial or industrial establishment
shall be served through one meter, except where this condition now exists
except where special conditions make it more practical to serve through on~
meter.
Where more than one residential unit (e.g., residential, apartment, mobile home,
housekeeping or other unit) or commercial or industrial establishment is served
through one meter, both the minimum charge and the consumption blocks set forth
in this section will be increased in proportion to the number of such uni ts
served through the one meter. Where more than one meter is required to serve a
single commercial or industrial establishment, the meter size will be combined
for the purpose of determining the minimum rate. Where multiple residential
uni ts are served through one meter, the minimum charge for each unit will be
based upon the residential minimum for a five-eighth-inch meter. In all such
multiple unit situations, a one-dollar per unit billing credit shall be granted
on the basis of an assumed eighty-five percent occupancy rate.
(Ord. 677, Sec. 1, 1982; Ord 776, 1985)
On a monthly basis, receivables and billing fees will be collected by the Water
Department for the Sanitation Department, Wastewater Utility, and Water
Department. The Water Department shall promptly determine the appropriate shares
of said receivables and forward to the Sanitation Department and Wastewater
Utility on a timely basis. For calculation of the Little Rock Air Base's
proportional share of the Wastewater Utility proportional share, the following
procedure shall be followed:
The total number of Wastewater Utility customers billed each month will be
multiplied by the Wastewater Utility's proportional amount ~customer billing
fee. The resulting amount will be remitted by the Water Department to th.Wastewater
Utility. The Wastewater Utility will then divide the amount receivE
by one minus Little Rock Air Force Base's contribution percentage (expressed i11
decimal traction form) and remit the resulting amount to the Water Department on
the business day following receipt of said funds and calculations.
The resulting difference between the amount rendered to the Wastewater Utility
and the amount returned to the Water Department will be Little Rock Air Force
Base's proportional share of the billing costs. Said amount will be billed by the
Wastewater Utility to Little Rock Air Force Base for reimbursement on a monthly
basis. (Ord. 952, Sec. 4, 1991)

13.24.10 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Paiis 405-4 71 are here
by incorporated. Those standards, if more stringent than the limitations by the latest approved
"Technically Based Local Limits Development Document" for sources in that sub-category, shall
supersede the limitations imposed by the Local Limits.
J. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in the terms of either mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Manager may impose equivalent concentration or
mass limits in accordance with 40 CPR 403.6(c).
2. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not
regulated by the same standard, the Manager shall impose an alternative limit using the combined
wastestream formula in 40 CPR 403.6(e). (Ord.1360Scc. l,2009)

15 . 04. 010 Findings of facts
A. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
identified Special Flood Hazard Areas of the City of
Jacksonville, Arkansas in the current scientific and
engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
for Pulaski County, Arkansas and Unincorporated Areas" dated
July 6, 2015, with an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) dated that same date.
B. These Special Flood Hazard Areas are subject to periodic
flooding events that result in loss of life and property,
pose health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and
governmental services, and cause extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
C. These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the
cumulative effective of floodplain developments which cause
an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the
placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed
or otherwise unprotected structures or uses
vulnerable to floods into Special Flood Hazard Areas. Such
structures or uses are inherently hazardous to other lands
because of their adverse impact on flooding events.
(Ord. 447 Art. 1 Sec. A, 1977; Ord. 1529, Sec. 1, 2015)
15. 04. 020 Statement of purpose
The purpose of this Code is to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain
development activities, and to minimize public and private losses due
to flooding events in identified Special Flood Hazard Areas. This Code
advances the stated purposes through provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Protect natural floodplains against unwise development;
C. Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development;
D. Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects;
E. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
F. Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events;
G. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in Special Flood Hazard Areas;
H. Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax
base; and,

This Code controls floodplain development (structural
development, placement of manufac tured structures, clearing,
grading, mining, drilling, dredging, placement of fill,
excavating, watercourse alte rat ion, drainage improvements,
roadway or bridge construction, individual wate r or sewer
installations, and other activities) which may increase flood
damage by increasing flood elevations, flood water
velocities, or flood discharge patterns; and,
This Code regulates the const r uction of flood barriers which
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact
other lands.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION GENERAL PROVISIONS
15. 04. 070 Interpretation
In the inlerpretation and application of this Code, all provisions
must:
A. Be considered as minimum requirements;
B. Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body;
and,
C. Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under Arkansas statutes.
(Ord. 447 Art. 3 Sec. D, 1977; Ord. 1529 Sec. 7, 2015)
15. 04. 080 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by these Code provisions are
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific
and engineering data form the basis for these requirements. However,
on rare occasions, flooding events greater than those considered to
develop these Code provisions will occur. In addition, flood heights
may increase over time due to man-made or natural
causes/circumstances. These Code provisions do not imply that land
outside Special Flood Hazard Areas will be free from flooding nor that
strict adherence to these provisions protects uses permitted within
Special Flood Hazard Areas from all flood damages. These Code
provisions specifically do not create liability on the part of the
City, nor any official or employee of the City, for any flood damages
that result while strictly following these provisions or from any
lawful administrative decision made under the provisions of these
Codes. (Ord. 447 Art. 3 Sec. E, 1977; Ord. 1529, Sec. 8, 2015)
15. 04. 090 Compliance
Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing
use of any structure or land after the effective date of these
provisions requires full compliance with the provisions of this
and all other applicable regulations.

Unless a provision explicitly states otherwise, the following terms
and phrases when and if as used, herein, shall have the meanings
hereinafter designated.
(1) Best Management Practices (BMP's) refers to management practices
and methods to control pollutants in stormwater. BMP' s are of
two types: "source controls" (nonstructural) and "treatment
controls" (structural). Source controls are practices that
prevent pollution by reducing potential pollutants at their
source, before they come into contact with stormwater. Treatment
controls remove pollutants from stormwater. The selection,
application, and maintenance of BMP's must be sufficient to
prevent or reduce the likelihood of pollutants entering the storm
drainage system. Specific BMP's shall be imposed by the City and
are discussed further in Appendix A.
(2) City means urban settlement with large population.
(3) Clearing means the act of cutting, removing from the ground,
burning, damaging or destroying trees, stumps, hedge, brush,
roots, logs, or scalping existing vegetation.
(4) Commercial means pertaining to any business, trade, industry, or
other activity engaged in for profit.
(5) Construction Site means any lo ca ti on where construction activity
occurs.
(6) Construction Spoil means material of any nature removed or
displaced during the construction or grading process.
(7) Contaminated means containing harmful quantities of pollutants.
(8) Contractor means any person or firm performing or managing
construction work at a construction site, including any
construction manager, general contractor, or subcontractor. Also
includes, but is not limited to, earthwork, paving, building,
plumbing, mechanical, electrical or landscaping contractors, and
material suppliers delivering materials to the site.
(9) Discharge means any addition or releases of any pollutant,
stormwater or any other substance whatsoever into storm drainage
system.

Temporary Structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) :
The following are City of Jacksonville preferred BMPs for t emporary
control of sedimentation during construction. More informa tion can be
f ound at the following EPA website:
http : //www.epa.gov/npdes/menuofbmps/con site.htm
Silt fence: Silt fen ces shall be constructed near the perimeter of a
disturbed area to inte rcept sediment while allowing water to p e rcolate
through. Silt fe nces may not be used where there is a concentrat ion
of water in a channel or other drainage . The fol lowing cr iteria are
applicable:
206 .9
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION
Drai11age area: Two (2) acres maximum per run (installation) of fabric
Height: Thirty Inches (30N) minimum
Material: Burlap, polypropylene fabric or nylon reinforced polyester
netl~ing.
Support: Wooden stakes or steel fence posts at Eight Feet (8')
maximum spacing.
Straw bale dikes: Straw bale dikes shall not be used in lieu of silt
fence to protect extensive areas. Approved uses include ditch
sediment sumps, support for silt fence in areas where floodwater
overtopping might be possible and for protection of grated inlets
prior to paving.
Area inlet protection: Fiber rolls or similar barriers shall be
placed around area inlets to prevent silt from entering the stormwater
collection system. Such protection shall be installed around inlets
prior to, and also subsequent to, paving around the inlets when
construction activities may deposit mud and silt on the newly place
pavement.
Entrances: A stabilized construction entrance shall be built to
reduce or eliminate the tracking or flowing of sediment onto public
rights of way. This entrance shall be the full width of the road or
access structure leading to the site and have to be at least Fifty
Feet ( 50') long with Six Inch ( 6") thick aggregate. The entrance
shall be maintained at all times.
Stone outlets: A stone outlet structure shall be constructed in areas
where the entire drainage area to the structu·re is not stabilized or
where there is a need to dispose runoff at a protected outlet or where
concentrated flow for the duration of the period of construction needs
to be diffused.
Temporary sedimentation basin: Stormwater detention facilities may be
used temporarily as sediment basins .
A temporary outlet structure for the stormwater detehtion facility to
work as a sediment pond shall be constructed.
At the end of the construction activity, the Developer shall make sure
that the outlet structure shall meet the design requirements of a
stormwater detention facility.
Condi ti on of the detention facility that is used as a sediment pond
during construction shall meet the following requirements at the time
of acceptance:
It shall be completely cleaned by the Developer and be rid of any
immediate maintenance.
Permanent Structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) :
The following are City of Jacksonville preferred BMPs for permanent
control of sedimentation following development construction. More
information can be found at the following EPA website:
http://www.epa.gov/npdes/menuofbmps/con site.htm
Depending on the project layout, a diversion shall be constructed
across a slope less than Fifteen Percent (15%) to:
Prevent runoff from higher areas having a potential for causing
erosion and thereby interfere with the establishment of vegetation on
lower areas.
Reduce the length of slopes to minimize soil loss.
Diversions need be constructed only below stabilized or protected
areas.
Outlets from diversions shall be constructed to discharge in such a
manner as not to cause erosion.

creation of an · internalized circulation system to provide access to
multiple lots and building cities, the Planning Commission may, at its
option, authorize the use of a service easement in lieu of public
commercial streets. Requests for such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider when the plat is submitted for preliminary
approval and shall present justification for such action. Private service
easements shall be built to public street standards except where, in the
opinion of the staff and the Planning Commission, a reduced pavement width
is deemed sufficient to ensure safe and convenient access to the lots and
otherwise fully complies in all respects with the purpose and intent of
this ordinance. Design of service easements shall be subject to the
review and approval of the City Engineer.

18.18.010 Purpose
It shall be the purpose of a Planned Unit Development ( PUD) zone to
promote encouragement, flexibility, and innovation in design of medium
to large scale developments and the development of vacant, in-fill
parcels in developed portions of the City. A Planned Unit Development
(PUD) is a description that provides wider latitude and flexibility of
design and uses to achieve the goals stated above, act ing as a
combination of zoning designation and site plan. Such a designation
shall deliver exceptional quality community designs that preserve
critical e nvironme ntal res ou rces, provide above-average open space
amenities, incorporate compatibility with surrounding land uses and
neighborhood characteristics, and provide greater effici ency in the
layout, property us es , and provisions of roads, utilitie s , and other
infrastructure. However, use of a PUD designa tion may not be used
solely as a method of avoidance of more restrictive zoning regulations
and provisions. (Ordinance. 1400 Sec. 1, 2010)

Standards
Compliance with the City's Comprehensive Development Use and
Plans.
Any Planned Unit Development (POD) must meet the spirit and
intent of the City' s approved Comprehensive Development Use
and Land Use Plans. Signifi cant departure of such must be
preceded by a request to amend one (1) and/or both Plans;
Ownership. The site of the Planned Unit Development
must be under single owner ship of an entity, individual, or
group;
Compatibility. The uses permitted in a Planned Unit
Development must be of a type and so located as to exercise
no undue detrimental influence upon any surrounding
properties. This will require factual determination(s) that
the POD meets the Review Standards identified h ere in;
Need. The Planning Commission shall consider a Planned Unit
Development proposal only after dete rmination that, at a
minimum, one (1) of the following threshold criteria is met:
1) The POD will allow the development of an in-fill
parcel in a developed portion of the City that could
not be made productive under normal zoning
regulations;
2) The PUD would further the City's goal of providing
housing for all economi c s egments of the City and its
Planning Area;
3) The POD involves a parcel in which flexibility would
allow high quality or innovative urban design not
possible under existing zoning regulations;
4) The PUD would aid in the elimination of blight within
the City and its Planning Area; and/or,
5) The POD design results in a minimum of Twenty Percent
(20%) of the total development being reserved as
permanent open space.
E) Size. There will be no minimum size requirement for a PUD
submittal. However, the Planning Commission shall consider
requests for PUD developments on sites less than One ( 1)
acre only in cases where a clear public interest is
addressed and where the proposal meets a specific
requirement of the Comprehensive Deve lopment Use and/or Land
Use Plans;
F) Concurrency. The Planning Commission shall consider a
PUD request only after determining that adequate public and
private utilities are available to the site or can be
extended to provide such (a fter approva l) at Applicant' s
expense; and/or,
G) Site Plan. Submission o f a detail ed Site Plan s atisfying the
requirements herein will precede conside ration of any PUD
proposal. If approved, p ropert y deve l opment must follow the
approved Site Plan exactly . Failure in this respect wil l
result in automatic reve rsion of the property to its
previous zoning classification.

18 . 76.080 Enforcement and Penalties
A) ENFORCEMENT The City Engineer /Code Enforcement Office shall be
responsible for the enforcement of the terms and conditions as outlined
herein. It is the desire of the City that a progressive from of
discipline be used with non-compliant responsible parties, providing them
with verbal warnings of no-compliant issues prior to written notice of the
non-compliant matters . When either notification is provided, the City
s hall set a definitive and reasonable time period in which the responsible
party should have the non-compliant condition eliminated. Non-compliant
matters of public safety will obviously require a quicker response time
than those of other non-compliant conditions.
Should the responsible party not eliminate the non- compliant condition
after receipt of said verbal and written notice. It is the duty of the
City Engineer/Code Enforcement Office to issue a citation to the
responsible party and present the matter for adjudication of a violation
of this Code by the Jacksonville District Court.
In the event that the City expends public monies to eliminate a noncompliant
condition upon private property, it is the responsibility of the
City Engineer/Code Enforcement Office to submit an itemized statement for
reimbursement of the costs to do so to the responsible party. If the
amount is not paid within sixty (60) days from the date of the first such
statement, the City Engineer /Code Enforcement Office shall cause to be
filed a tax lien against the real property owned by the responsible party
within Pulaski County, Arkansas, for collection of said amounts with the
party's taxes each year.
B) Penalties
Should any individual, business, entity, or other such designated
responsible party be found by the Jacksonville District Court to be in
violation of the terms and conditions as outlined by this Code, the Court
shall assess a fine of no more than one hundred dollars ($100. 00) per
violation per day, together with appropriate court costs. Each day a
condition of non-compliance exists constitutes a separate violation and is
subject to prosecution.
For second or subsequent violations within the same calendar year, the
Court shall assess a fine of no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
per violation per day, together with appropriate court costs. Again, each
day a condition of non-compliance exists constitutes a separate violation
subject to prosecution.
