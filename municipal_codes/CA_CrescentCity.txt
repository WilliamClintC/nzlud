If the violation cannot be completely corrected, the violation must be abated in the manner described in the notice of violation.

        (b)    An administrative citation shall be served on the responsible party by an enforcement officer in one of the following ways:

In the case of service by regular first class mail, the date of service shall be the date upon which such mail was deposited in the United States Mail with postage prepaid, plus three days.

        (3)    Service by posting notice. If the enforcement officer does not succeed in serving the responsible party by personal service or by mail as set forth above, the enforcement officer shall post the administrative citation on any real property within the City in which the City has knowledge that the responsible party has a legal interest, and such posting shall be deemed effective service. The date of service of a posted notice or citation shall be the date of actual posting, plus five days. (Ord. No. 732, § 1, 4-21-2008)

 

1.24.070 Contents of administrative citation.

        (d)    The City may collect any past due administrative citation fines and/or late payment charges by the use of the small claims court, or any other legal remedy. (Ord. No. 732, § 1, 4-21-2008)

1.24.140 Judicial review.
        Any person aggrieved by the administrative order issued by the hearing officer may obtain review of the administrative order by filing a notice of appeal with the Del Norte County Superior Court in accordance with the timelines and provisions set forth in Government Code Section 53069.4. Payment of the appeal fee is the responsibility of the appellant. (Ord. No. 732, § 1, 4-21-2008)

 

1.24.150 Lien and special assessment procedures.
        The city council may cause any unpaid administrative citations, including late fees, penalties, and other administrative costs, to become a lien or special assessment against the subject property in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and pursuant to California Government Code §§ 38773.1 and 38773.5.

        This section will only apply to properties on which a nuisance was maintained as identified in chapters 12.16 and 8.08, and where an administrative citation was duly issued pursuant to this Chapter 1.24. The following criteria must be met prior to an unpaid administrative citation becoming a lien or special assessment.

        A.    Report of unpaid citations. The community development director, or designee, will keep an accounting of the unpaid administrative citations, including late fees, penalties, and other administrative costs. If an administrative citation remains unpaid for a period of thirty days, the director may initiate lien and special assessment proceedings by making a full report to the city council with an itemized account of the overdue amounts owed for the subject property. The report will include a day, time and place for the city council to hear argument and make a decision on the proposed lien and special assessment.

        B.     Notice and hearing. A hearing before the city council will be held in order for the council to determine whether the delinquent amounts will be made a lien or special assessment against the subject parcel.

        Notice of the hearing and of the lien or special assessment must be posted on the subject property and mailed to the last known address of the property owner fifteen days prior to the hearing. The city council will make a decision at the hearing even if the property owner is not present.

        The property owner may present argument disputing the amount of the proposed assessment at the hearing. The city council will not hear argument about whether a nuisance existed on the property, or whether the administrative citation should have been issued, because opportunity for argument on those issues are provided for elsewhere in this Code.

        C.     Assessment of costs against property—Lien. After hearing the arguments and examining the report, the city council will, by resolution, certify the community development director’s report of unpaid administrative fines and related expenses and authorize recording of the lien and special assessment procedures.

        Prior to recording the lien against the property the property owner must be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10 of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

        If the owner cannot be found after diligent search a copy of the notice may be posted in a conspicuous place on the property for a period of ten days and publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property is located.

        Thereafter, a lien will be recorded in the county recorder’s office in the county in which the parcel is located and will have the effect and priority of a judgment lien. The lien must specify the amount of the lien, the name of the agency imposing it, the date of the citation, a legal description of the subject property, and the name of the owner of record.

        D.    Special assessment. As an alternative to recording the lien the City may make the amount specified in the city council’s resolution a special assessment against the subject property.

        At the direction of the council the city clerk will forward the relevant information to the tax collector for unpaid delinquent amounts. The assessment will be collected at the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same laws as ordinary municipal taxes.

        At the same time that the assessment is imposed the city clerk will provide notice, by certified mail, to the property owner, if the property owner’s whereabouts can be determined. The notice will include a warning that delinquent taxes may result in the sale of the property in accordance with Section 3691 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. (Ord. No. 778, § 3, 1-8-2014)

Chapter 3.20 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
3.20.010 Definitions.
        Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

        A.    “Hotel” means any structure or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, excluding mobilehomes in a mobilehome park and mobilehomes in which the tenant is an employee of the owner or operator of the mobilehome.

Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

        D.    “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Prior code § 25-304)

 

3.20.050 Registration and certificate required.
        Upon commencing business, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transient shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him/ her a “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

        B.     The address of the hotel;

This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department, or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991)

 

3.20.060 Reporting and remittance of tax.

The operator shall accurately and fully complete such returns as are required by the tax administrator, as revised from time to time. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he/she deems it necessary in order to ensure timely collection of the tax and he/she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991)

 

3.20.070 Failure to collect and report—Determination of tax by tax administrator.
        If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he/she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his/her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he/she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he/she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his/her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.20.080. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991)

 

3.20.080 Appeals.

3.20.100 Refunds.
        A.    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

        B.     An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a trans-ient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

        C.     A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, established to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

        D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991; prior code § 25-311)

 

3.20.110 Debt owed to city—Liability for recovery.
        A.    Actions to Collect. Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by any operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.

        B.     Recording Certificate—Lien. If any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter is not paid when due, the tax administrator may within three years after the amount is due file for record in the office of the Del Norte county recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the operator liable for the same, and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid, together with penalties and interest, constitutes a lien upon real property in the county owned by the operator or acquired by him afterwards and before the lien expires. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

        C.     Priority and Lien of Tax. The amounts required to be paid by any operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:

        1.     Whenever the person is insolvent;

        2.     Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his/her assets;

        3.     Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased; or

        4.     Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter is levied upon by process of law.

        This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which was attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien.

        D.    Warrant for Collection of Tax. At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount required under this chapter to be paid off after the recording of a lien under subsection B of this section, the tax administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal or constable, the same fees, commissions and expenses for his/her services as are provided by law for similar services pursuant to a writ of execution.

        E.     Seizure and Sale. At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the tax administrator may forthwith col- lect the amount in the following manner: The tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or sufficient part of it at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.

        F.     Successor’s Liability —Withholding by Purchaser. If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his/her business or quits the business, his/her successor and/or assignee shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt stating that no amount is due.

        G.    Liability of Purchaser —Release. If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold funds from the purchase price as required, he/she shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him/her to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner’s records are made available for audit, whichever period expires later, but in any event not later than ninety days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his/her address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice shall release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as provided in this section. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his/her business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever occurs later.

        H.    Liability of Seller. Sale of a hotel, dismissal of the operator or other termination of his/her rights to operate the facility shall not relieve him/her from liability for taxes due or owing under this chapter. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991)

 

3.20.120 Penalties and interest.
        A.    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

        B.     Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

        C.     Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

        D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

        E.     Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1991; prior code § 25.307)

 

3.20.130 Violations—Misdemeanor.
        Any person violating any provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

        Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required under this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim, with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

(Prior code § 31-114)

 

5.32.800 Implementation of the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006.
        A.    Purposes and Implementation. It is the purpose of this section to implement within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city of Crescent City the provisions of the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006, Assembly Bill 2987 (Ch. 700, Stats. 2006), codified at Public Utilities Code Sections 5800, et seq. (the “Act”), and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated thereunder that are applicable to a “local franchising entity” or a “local entity” as defined in Sections 5830(h) and 5830(k) of the California Public Utilities Code, respectively. Consistent with that purpose, the provisions of this section are to be construed in a manner that is consistent with the California Public Utilities Code and the applicable rules of the commission promulgated thereunder.

        B.     Franchise Fee.

        1.     The franchise fee established within the city for cable franchises is five percent of gross revenues. Every state franchisee operating within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city shall pay a franchise fee to the city in the amount of five percent of that state franchisee’s gross revenues derived from the operation of its network to provide cable or video services within the city.

        2.     For purposes of this section, “gross revenue” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5860 of the California Public Utilities Code.

        3.     A state franchisee shall remit the franchise fee to the city quarterly, within forty-five days after the end of the quarter for that calendar quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a summary explaining the basis for the calculation of the franchise fee. If the state franchisee does not pay the franchise fee when due, the state franchisee shall pay a late payment charge at a rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent. If the state franchisee has overpaid the franchise fee, it may deduct the overpayment from its next quarterly payment.

        C.     PEG Channels.

        1.     The current cable franchise designates one channel for public, educational and government (PEG) programming, with additional channels up to three available to the city. Local franchisees and holders of state franchises under the Act shall provide one PEG channel, with additional channels, up to three PEG Channels, upon city’s written request, subject to the provisions of subsection 3, below, and the Act.

        2.     All state franchisees shall comply with the provisions of the Act related to PEG channels. Without limiting the foregoing, the PEG channels shall all be carried on the basic service tier. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by the incumbent cable operator unless prohibited by federal law and shall provide picture and sound quality and channel accessibility and location equal to, or substantially equal to, that provided by the incumbent cable providers. After the initial designation of PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the local entity unless the change is required by federal law.

        3.     A state franchise holder shall have three months from the date the city requests the PEG channels to designate the capacity. However, the three-month period shall be tolled by any period during which the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, including any failure or delay of the incumbent cable operator to take adequate interconnection available, as required by the Act. Any state franchise holder who believes that the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, shall provide to the city, in writing, its reasons therefor and its plan for correcting or solving the infeasibility. The city may hold a hearing on the claim of infeasibility and, thereafter, take such action as the city deems proper to require the designation and provision of the PEG channels on the state franchise holder’s system.

        D.    PEG Channel Facilities Fee and Payments. All state franchise holders operating within the city shall pay to the city a PEG fee equal to one percent of gross revenues. The city shall use the PEG fees consistent with applicable state and federal law. The PEG fee may be shown as a separate line item on the regular bill of each subscriber.

        E.     Customer Service and Protection.

        1.     A state franchisee shall comply with Sections 53055, 53055.1, 53055.2 and 53088.2 of the California Government Code; the FCC customer service and notice standards set forth in Sections 76.309, 76.1602, 76.1603 and 76.1619 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations; Section 637.5 of the California Penal Code; the privacy standards of Section 551 of Title 47 of the United States Code; and all other applicable state and federal customer service and consumer protection standards pertaining to the provision of video service, including any such standards hereafter adopted. In case of a conflict, the stricter standard shall apply. All customer service and consumer protection standards under this paragraph shall be interpreted and applied to accommodate newer or different technologies while meeting or exceeding the goals of the standards.

        2.     The city shall enforce, in the manner set forth in the Act, all customer service and protection standards contained in Section 5900 of the Act, including without limitation those standards set forth in Section 5900(c). The city is authorized to impose penalties for any material breach of the Act, as set forth herein.

        3.     The maximum monetary penalties set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 5900 are hereby adopted and enacted as the applicable schedule of penalties for the material breach of the Act, including but not limited to Section 5900 of the Act, by a holder of a state franchise, as follows:

Chapter 5.44 MOBILE VENDORS
5.44.010 Purpose.
        The council finds and declares as follows:

        A.    The sale of goods by mobile vendors and sidewalk vendors, as defined in Chapter 5.45, serves the general welfare, if such operation is properly regulated to minimize health, safety, and welfare concerns for the city.

        B.     California Vehicle Code Section 22455 allows local authorities to regulate the type of vending and the time, place, and manner of vending from vehicles upon the street in order to promote public safety and Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution extends to cities the police power to regulate in furtherance of the public health and welfare.

        C.     The city has an important and substantial public interest in providing regulations to prevent safety, traffic and health hazards, as well as to preserve the peace, safety and welfare of the community.

        D.    Unregulated mobile vending creates concerns regarding the orderly and safe movement of both vehicles and pedestrians. Keeping pedestrians out of the streets and the sidewalks free from obstruction are top priorities for the city.

        E.     Locating near schools during school hours creates the potential to attract school children off campus to engage in unsupervised transactions during school hours.

        F.     The congregation of pedestrians and activity near intersections, bus stops, loading zones and driveways utilized by emergency service vehicles has the potential to reduce traffic safety as drivers’ line of sight may be reduced, drivers may be distracted by the activity, and it may be more difficult for drivers to spot pedestrians ready to cross the street.

        G.    Requiring separation between mobile vendors and farmer’s markets and special events serves to prevent confusion by attendees as to which vendors are part of the event and which are not part of the event. Said separation also serves to incentivize participation by mobile vendors in farmer’s markets and special events, which stimulate the local economy by showcasing local businesses and attracting tourists and consumers.

        H.    Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit, prevent or hinder activities of political, economic, religious or sociological ideas when such activities are noncommercial.

        I.      Nothing in this chapter shall limit the regulation of the sale of fireworks, which is regulated by the Office of the State Fire Marshal, unless by local option all fireworks should, at a future date, be prohibited within the city limits.

        J.      Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the sale of newspapers. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2020; Ord. 609, 1986)

Chapter 8.08 NUISANCES GENERALLY
8.08.010 Purpose and scope.
        A.    This title shall be known as the “nuisance code,” may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as “this code.”

        B.     In order to further the stated goals of the city of Crescent City to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by requiring a level of maintenance of private property which will protect the livability, appearance and social and economic stability of the city and to protect its citizens and their property from conditions which are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and community appearance, or hazardous or injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the general public, the city council has determined that a code is necessary to effectively abate or prevent the development of such conditions in the city of Crescent City.

        C.     It is the intention of the city council, in adopting the code codified herein, to set forth guidelines for determining what conditions constitute a public nuisance; to establish a method for giving notice of the conditions and an opportunity to correct them; and finally in the event the public nuisance is not abated or corrected, to provide a procedure for a hearing and determination of the facts and manner in which the conditions shall be corrected or removed.

        D.    It is the purpose of this code to provide a just, equitable and practical method, in addition to any other remedy available at law, whereby lands or buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, dangerous, unsanitary, cluttered with weeds, debris, abandoned or inoperable vehicles, machinery or equipment, or are a menace, or hazard to life, limb, safety, health, morals, property values, aesthetic standards or the general welfare of the city of Crescent City, may be required to be repaired, renovated, vacated, demolished, made safe or cleaned up by removal of offensive conditions.

        E.     Another purpose of this code is to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures on both public and private property and to provide regulations designed to prevent and control the further spread of graffiti in the city.

        F.     Another purpose of this code is to provide a program for the removal and/or abatement as public nuisances of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof from private or public property. (Prior code § 32-201).

        G.    In addition to the abatement procedures provided herein, this code declares certain conditions to be public nuisances and that continuance of such conditions shall be a misdemeanor.

        H.    This code is not intended to enforce conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&R’s) on property, nor to supersede them. This code will be enforced uniformly within the city regardless of CC&R’s.

This termination fee shall be calculated to recover the cost of closing the file, removing or placing liens, and other associated administrative costs. Costs shall be assessed at the conclusion of the abatement; provided, however, in the case of abatement by any method which takes more than six months, costs may be assessed at any time after six months, but in no event more than two times a year.

        Costs and expenses may be recovered even if the nuisance is corrected voluntarily, subsequent to the issuance of an abatement order. No fees shall be due and owing if the council determines no nuisance exists. All fees shall be a personal obligation of the owner and a lien upon the property and are due and payable within thirty days of issuance of the notice and order or closing of the file respectively. Any fee not paid within that time shall be payable to the city.

        B.     The city manager/designee shall keep an account of the costs (including incidental expenses) of abating such nuisance on each separate lot or parcel of land where the work is done and shall render an itemized billing to the property owner which shall be due and payable within thirty days. If the owner refuses or neglects to pay the bill, an itemized report in writing shall be made to the planning commission showing the cost of abatement and the rehabilitating, demolishing or repairing of said premises, buildings or structures, including any salvage value relating thereto; provided, that before said report is submitted to the planning commission, a copy of the same shall be mailed together with a notice of the time when said report shall be heard by the planning commission for confirmation.

        C.     The planning commission shall set the matter for hearing to determine the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such costs, and shall serve notice thereof.

        D.    Proof of said service shall be made by declaration under penalty of perjury filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 704 Exh. A, 2004; Ord. 688 § 1, 2001)

 

8.08.190 Record of abatement cost—Hearing and proceedings.
        At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the report, the planning commission shall hear and pass upon the reports of such costs of abatement, together with any objections or protests raised by any of the persons liable to be assessed for the cost of abating the nuisance.

        Thereupon, the planning commission may make such revision, correction or modification in the report, as it may deem just, after which, by motion, the report, as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The hearing may be continued from time to time. The decision of the planning commission on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 688 § l, 2001)

 

8.08.200 Nuisance abatement lien.
        A.

The notice shall specify the amount of the lien, the name of the city, the date of the abatement order, the street address, the legal description and the assessors parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. The notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Del Norte County pursuant to Section 6062 of the Government Code. The notice of lien shall be in substantially the form provided in Section 8.08.210(B) of this code.

        B.     After notice is given in accordance with subsection A of this section, the notice of lien shall be recorded in the Del Norte County recorders office and shall thereafter constitute a lien on the real property for the expense of the abatement, the related administrative costs together with interest thereon.

        C.     In the event the lien is discharged, released or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the same information as the notice of lien shall be recorded in the Del Norte County recorder’s office.

        D.    The city may enforce the nuisance abatement lien by an action for a money judgment.

 

8.08.210 Assessment of abatement costs against property.
        A.    As an alternate to the procedure set forth in Section 8.08.200, the city may use a special assessment procedure to collect the abatement costs. The total cost for abating such nuisance, as so confirmed by the planning commission, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of a notice of lien, as so made and confirmed, shall constitute a lien on said property for the amount of such assessment.

        1.     After such confirmation and recordation, a copy may be turned over to the tax collector for the county, whereupon it shall be the duty of the tax collector to add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against said respective lots and parcels of land for municipal purposes, and thereafter said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes; or

        2.     After such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law.

        B.     Such notice of lien for recordation shall be in the form substantially as follows:

Each owner shall submit a proposed abandoned cart prevention plan to the Crescent City Planning Department [within] sixty days of the effective date of this chapter, and by July 1 of each year thereafter.

        B.     The director of the Crescent City Planning Department shall approve or reject the proposed abandoned cart prevention plan within thirty days of the plan’s submission. The director of the Crescent City Planning Department may deny a plan based upon any of the following grounds:

        2.     The plan fails to include all of the information required by this chapter;

        3.     The plan is insufficient or inadequate to prevent removal of carts from the premises;

        4.     The plan fails to address any special or unique conditions due to the geographical location of the premises as they relate to cart retention and prevention efforts;

        5.     Implementation of the plan violates a term or condition of a plan or other requirement of this chapter; or

        6.     The owner knowingly makes a false statement of fact or omits a fact required to be revealed in an application for the plan, or in any amendment or report or other information required to be made.

        C.     If the plan is rejected as incomplete or inadequate, the director of the Crescent City Planning Department shall indicate areas that are incomplete or inadequate, and the owner shall have an additional thirty days within which to resubmit a complete and adequate plan. The Crescent City Planning Department will approve or reject the resubmitted plan within thirty days of the date of resubmission of the plan.

        D.    Once approved, the measures included in the plan shall be implemented no later than thirty days of the plan’s approval. If an owner is proposing new measures, the measures from the approved plan in the previous year shall be continued until the new measures are implemented.

        E.     Any owner that fails to submit a plan, implement the plan measures, or implement any required modifications to the plan within the time frames specified in this chapter shall be required to keep all carts inside the building or enclosed areas of the business.

        F.     Any owner who is required to, but fails to keep all carts inside the building or enclosed area of the premises in violation of subsection F above, shall be subject to an administrative civil penalty in accordance with the administrative enforcement remedies set forth in Chapter 1.24 of Title 1 of this code.

        G.    The decision of the director of the planning department to deny a plan may be appealed to the city manager, or his/her designee. A written notice of appeal must be submitted to the director of the Crescent City Planning Department within ten days of the denial of the plan and accompanied by a copy of the plan. The city manager or designee shall review the plan under the grounds for denial set forth in subsection B of this section and provide a decision approving or denying the plan within thirty days of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the city manager or designee shall be final. There shall be no further administrative appeal process.

        H.    Even though approved, a plan may be reevaluated at any time by the director of the Crescent City Planning Department if operation of the plan demonstrates the plan’s insufficiency or inadequacy in preventing removal of carts from the premises. (Ord. No. 761, 12-5-2011)

 

8.20.120 Violations.
        Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Chapter 8.22 FIREWORKS
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. No. 769-U, § 4, adopted June 18, 2012, set out provisions intended for use as Ch. 8.20. Due to the current existence of a Ch. 8.20 and at the editor’s discretion, these provisions have been included as Ch. 8.22.

 

8.22.010 Purpose.
        A.    This chapter authorizes the imposition of administrative fines on any person who violates any provision of this ordinance in order to encourage and obtain compliance with the provisions of this ordinance for the benefit and protection of the entire community. This chapter governs the imposition, enforcement, collection and administrative review of all administrative fines, related to: the possession, use, storage, sale and/or display of those fireworks classified as “dangerous fireworks” in California Health and Safety Code Section 12500, et seq., with the exception of a pyrotechnic licensee when operating pursuant to that license. Said administrative fines are imposed under authority of Government Code Section 53069.4, Health and Safety Code Section 12557, and the police power of the city.

        B.     The issuance of citations imposing administrative fines may be performed at the discretion of the officials of the city authorized hereunder; and the issuance of a citation to any person constitutes but one remedy of the city to redress violations of this code by any person. By adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its authority to employ any other remedy, civil or criminal, to redress any violation of this code by any person, which this city may otherwise pursue.

        C.     The imposition of fines related to “dangerous fireworks” under this chapter shall be limited to persons who possess, sell, use and/or display, or the seizure of, twenty-five pounds or less (gross weight) of such dangerous fireworks.

        D.    Fines collected pursuant to this chapter related to “dangerous fireworks” shall not be subject to Health and Safety Code Section 12706, which section provides that certain fines collected by a court of the state be deposited with, and disbursed by, the county treasurer. However, the city shall provide cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal pursuant to regulations to be adopted by the state fire marshal addressing the state fire marshal’s cost for the transportation and disposal of “dangerous fireworks” seized by the city, which costs will be part of any administrative fine imposed. Unless and until said regulations have been adopted by the state of California, the city shall hold in trust two hundred fifty dollars or twenty-five percent of any fine collected, whichever is greater, to cover the cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal for said cost of transportation and disposal of the “dangerous fireworks.”

        E.     Because of the serious threat of fire or injury posed by the use of “dangerous fireworks” that can result from persistent or repeated failures to comply with the provisions of this code and the effect of such conditions or activities on the safety and the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and to the public health, safety and welfare, this chapter imposes strict civil liability upon the owners of residential real property for all violations of this code existing on their residential real property. Each contiguous use, display and/or possession shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to a separate administrative fine. (Ord. No. 769-U, § 4, 6-18-2012)

        2.     Mailing of administrative fine citation to the citee by certified mail with return receipt, to the address shown on the official records of the county assessor; or

        a.     By leaving a copy at the recipient’s dwelling or usual place of abode, in the presence of a competent member of the household, and thereafter mailing by first class mail, postage pre-paid, a copy to the recipient at the address where the copy was left; or

        b.     In the event the responsible party cannot be served by first class mail, postage pre-paid, or cannot be personally served and has a property manager or rental agency overseeing the premises, substituted service may be made upon the property manager or rental agency or may be affected by posting the property with the administrative fine citation and mailing a copy by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the responsible party in violation at the address of the property where the violation exists.

For purposes of this chapter, there may be more than one responsible person for a violation. Any person, irrespective of age, found in violation of any provision of this chapter may be issued a citation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Every parent, guardian or other person, having the legal care, custody or control of any person under the age of eighteen years, who knows or reasonably should know that a minor is in violation of this chapter, may be issued a citation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, in addition to any citation that may be issued to the offending minor.

        J.      “Violation” or “violates” refers to any violation of any provision of this code. (Ord. No. 769-U, § 4, 6-18-2012)

The failure of a citee to receive a properly addressed notice of hearing will not invalidate the citation or any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter.

        B.     Sections 1.24.090 to 1.24.140, inclusive, of the Code apply to administrative hearings on citations issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. No. 769-U, § 4, 6-18-2012)

Chapter 8.24 SOCIAL HOST ORDINANCE
8.24.010 Intent and purpose.
        A.    The city council of the City of Crescent City, under the city’s police powers, has the authority to enact and enforce laws that promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents. The occurrence of social gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons is harmful to the underage persons involved, and a threat to public health and safety, to the quiet enjoyment of residential property, and to the general welfare. Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows, or should know, of the underage consumption of alcohol.

        B.     The city council finds that in too many cases persons having possession or control of private property and who are responsible for social gatherings on that property have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to, nor consumed by, underage persons at these gatherings. The city council further finds that problems associated with social gatherings where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons are difficult to prevent and deter unless law enforcement personnel have the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering and to cite the responsible persons.

        C.     Law enforcement personnel have in the past been required to respond to unruly gatherings on private property at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons. These calls for service result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and delay official responses to other calls in the rest of the city.

        D.    An ordinance that imposes liability on property owners and other responsible persons for gatherings that allow underage drinking is necessary to deter and prevent such gatherings. Persons who actively or passively aid, allow, or tolerate such gatherings should be held liable for permitting such gatherings, the nuisances created by them, and the costs associated with responding to them.

        E.     The purposes of this chapter include protecting the public health, safety and welfare by deterring the service to, and consumption of, alcoholic beverages by underage persons and by reducing the costs to the public of providing law enforcement response services to unruly gatherings and gatherings of underage persons where alcohol is served, both in terms of monetary costs and availability of law enforcement personnel for other calls.

        F.     These purposes are implemented by the imposition of criminal penalties for social hosts as well as the imposition of administrative penalties for social hosts and landowners (including landlords) and the imposition of fees to recover the costs incurred by the city in providing law enforcement responses to gatherings where alcohol is served to, or consumed by, underage persons at properties where previous such gatherings have required law enforcement responses.

        G.    For these reasons, the city council declares that gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, or consumed by, underage persons are a threat to the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare, and a public nuisance because they affect at the same time the entire community as well as the neighborhoods in which they occur. (Ord. 776 § 2, 2013)

 

8.24.020 Definitions.

The contestant shall appear at the hearing, unless a hearing by mail has been requested on the appeal request form, If the contestant fails to appear at the hearing, the contest shall be decided by the hearing officer based on the citation, the record of the initial review, and any other relevant material in the record, taking into account the reasons specified by the contestant in the appeal request form.

        c.     Hearing Record. The hearing officer shall write pertinent information into the record during the in person hearing. The hearing record and any supporting documentation will remain with the case file at the Department. If the contestant appeals the hearing officer’s decision to the Superior Court, the entire case file will be forwarded to the court. The hearing records for those cases not appealed to the Superior Court will be retained by the Department for one year.

        d.     Representation. The contestant may, in his or her discretion, be represented by an attorney in the appeal process, including but not limited to, the contest hearing. Any such representation shall be at the sole and exclusive cost of the contestant. No contestant shall be entitled to representation at the expense of the City, or any other public agency, irrespective of indigency status.

        2.     Conduct of the Hearing.

        a.     Initial procedures—Hearing officer duties. At the commencement of the hearing, the hearing officer shall:

        i.      Make a pre-hearing statement, briefly explain the nature of the proceedings, the manner of conducting the hearing and the limits on the introduction of evidence, the process of rendering a decision, the effects of the decision in terms of collection remedies available to the City, the right of the contestant to appeal to the superior court for a de novo hearing, and any other matters the hearing officer deems necessary to mention;

        ii.     Administer an oath to the contestant and any witnesses;

        iii.    Read the citation into the record;

        iv.    Record the name and address of the contestant; and

        v.     Write the registered owners name and address and relationship to contestant, if applicable.

        b.     Proof Requirements - Validity of Citation.

        i.      Burden of Proof. The Department bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the citation meets statutory requirements for validity.

        ii.     Prima Facie Case. If the citation, or a copy thereof, contains all of the items specified in Vehicle Code Section 40202, and if the Department has included in the record the information received from the DMV identifying the registered owner of the vehicle, the citation and such information shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, and of the parking violation. The Department shall not be required to produce any other information in order to establish the parking violation.

        iii.    Rebuttal. The contestant may introduce credible relevant rebuttal evidence relating to the validity of the citation.

        c.     Proof Requirements—Contestant’s Defenses.

        i.      Burden of Proof—Defenses. The contestant bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that although the citation is facially valid, a viable defense exists which would preclude the contestant’s liability for the parking penalty, or that a viable defense exists which would limit the contestant’s liability for late payment penalties.

        ii.     Defenses—Late Payment Penalties. Nonreceipt of the notice of violation itself, if based on sufficient credible evidence, may constitute a defense to late payment penalties based on nonpayment of the notice of violation. However, nonreceipt of the notice of violation is not a defense to late response to the notice of delinquent parking violation. The defense of nonreceipt of the notice of violation is not available to the registered owner if it is established that the person operating the vehicle at the time of the citation was not the registered owner. Clear proof of timely payment of the citation is a defense to late payment penalties.

        iii.    Defenses—Merits of Citation. Defenses relating to the merits of the citation must be established by the contestant by credible evidence. Such defenses may include, but are not limited to, signage matters (missing, obscured or defaced signs), where the contestant demonstrates that it was impossible for him or her to become aware of the applicable parking restrictions; malfunctioning parking meters; recent loss of parking permit or placard, accompanied by clear proof of the exercise of due diligence in efforts to replace the permit or placard; mechanical breakdown of the vehicle, where the vehicle was not illegally parked prior to the breakdown, where the violation in fact results from the breakdown and reasonable steps were taken to remove the vehicle prior to the occurrence of the violation. Personal reasons, inconvenience, lack of funds, forgetfulness, failure to observe signs, lack of available parking elsewhere, lack of knowledge of the applicable parking restrictions, and similar or related matters are not under any circumstances a defense to liability for parking penalties. No defense which was not included in the statement of reasons contained in the contestant’s appeal request form will be considered.

        d.     Evidence.

        i.      Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence for civil court shall not apply in hearings conducted pursuant to this chapter. Evidence relevant to the issues raised by the contestant’s statement of reasons, and to the validity of the citation itself under Vehicle Code Section 40202, will be received. Determinations of credibility of evidence are committed to the sound discretion of the hearing officer.

        ii.     Form of Evidence. Other than the citation and the DMV information, the hearing officer shall receive into the record the Department’s record from the initial review, together with relevant testimony, documentation and other material which is submitted by a party. Credibility determinations, together with determinations as to the weight to be assigned to evidence, are committed to the sound discretion of the hearing officer. The hearing officer may, but is not required to, admit evidence in the form of declarations of witnesses, submitted by the contestant. Such declarations shall not be admitted unless presented in the form required for declarations under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2015.5 and shall contain the statements required by Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c(d).

        e.     Witnesses. The contestant may present witnesses in support of the contestant’s contentions. The hearing officer, after conducting the initial procedures of the hearing, may exclude witnesses until their turn to testify occurs. The hearing officer may limit the number of witnesses in the interest of preventing cumulative or repetitive testimony.

        f.      Cross-Examination by Hearing Officer. The hearing officer may conduct such cross-examination of the contestant or any witness, when in the hearing officer’s sole and exclusive discretion cross-examination is warranted under all of the circumstances.

        E.     Hearing Decision.

        1.     Basis for Decision. The hearing officer shall make a decision on liability for the parking penalties based on the testimony and other evidence presented at the hearing.

        2.     Disposition. The hearing officer shall enter the disposition on the hearing record, and enter the total amount of the parking penalties. The decision, including the rationale for it, shall be placed in written form.

        3.     Notice of Final Decision. The hearing officer shall send the written decision to the contestant via first class mail. The hearing officer shall also furnish the Department with a copy of the decision.

        4.     Finality. The decision shall be the final decision of the Department. The decision shall set forth the time limits for the contestant to file for judicial review in the Del Norte County Superior Court and a notice that if no such review is sought within the applicable time limitation, the decision will be final and all rights to appeal forfeited.

Upon a finding by the city council at the public hearing that the vehicle, or parts thereof, is abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative, constituting a public nuisance, the city council shall order the abatement and removal of the vehicle and the administrative costs of removal and disposal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, against the property on which it is located.

        B.

        C.     The hearing body may impose such conditions and take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle, or part thereof, if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing body may find that a vehicle or part thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property, and by resolution order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this chapter and determine the administrative costs and the costs of removal to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which the vehicle, or part thereof, is located. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle, or part thereof, and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

        D.    If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the hearing body shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such landowner.

(Ord. 674 § 2)

Chapter 10.60 IMPOUNDED VEHICLES
10.60.010 Purpose.
        This chapter’s purpose is to establish a fee and a charge, payable to the City of Crescent City, in an amount equal to the city’s administrative costs and expenses for:

        A.    Removing, impounding, storing, or releasing a lawfully impounded vehicle; and

        B.     Processing an appeal and conducting a hearing after a vehicle is impounded. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.020 Findings.
        The city council finds, determines and declares that:

        A.    California’s Vehicle Code authorizes the police department and other duly authorized persons to remove motor vehicles from the city’s streets and hold, or “impound,” the vehicles for certain violations of the law, such as: unpaid parking tickets, expired registration, illegal parking, driving under the influence or without a license, speed contests, or reckless driving. The Vehicle Code also permits the police department to impound vehicles for preserving evidence, investigating a crime and other lawful reasons. The city’s police department regularly impounds vehicles in violation of those laws.

        B.     To provide the public with dependable, expeditious towing, storage and roadside assistance for motor vehicle collisions, inoperative vehicles, stolen and recovered vehicles or illegally parked vehicles, the city’s police department operates a towing program. One or more private-sector companies not only tow and store vehicles for the public, but also remove and garage impounded vehicles on the city’s behalf. At the police department’s request, the private companies under contract with the city tow these vehicles and keep them safe until the owner or the owner’s agent requests the impounded vehicle’s release.

        C.     Vehicle Code Section 22850.5(a) authorizes the city to adopt an ordinance for imposing a vehicle impound release fee equal to the city’s administrative expense related to removing, impounding, storing or releasing vehicles. Additionally, Vehicle Code Section 22850.5(b)(4) allows the city to impose a charge, as part of its administrative costs, for providing a hearing or an appeal on the impounded vehicle’s removal, impoundment, storage or release, if the registered owner, the legal owner or either one’s agent requests in a hearing in writing.

        D.    In using private contractors to provide vehicle towing, storage, and roadside assistance to the public, the police department incurs substantial labor costs and administrative expenses when it impounds a vehicle and later releases it to the owner, including, but not limited to:

        1.     Documenting the impound;

        2.     Contacting the court or prosecutor and confirming the vehicle is no longer needed as evidence;

        3.     Verifying that department of motor vehicle registration fees have been paid;

        4.     Releasing the impound hold on the vehicle; and

        5.     Conducting a post-impound hearing or processing a post-impound appeal.

        E.     When the police department lawfully impounds a vehicle for a violation of the law, the vehicle’s owner, rather than the public at large, should reimburse the city for its costs to impound the vehicle. Therefore, creating a vehicle impound release fee and requiring the vehicle’s owner to pay the fee are appropriate means for not only recovering the city’s administrative costs and expenses, but also ensuring that the general public does not shoulder the burden of paying them.

        F.     When the vehicle’s owner requests a hearing or appeal concerning the impounded vehicle’s removal, impoundment, storage or release, that person, rather than the public at large, should reimburse the city for its costs to conduct the hearing and process the appeal. Therefore, creating a post-impound hearing charge and requiring the vehicle’s owner to pay the charge are appropriate means for not only recovering the city’s administrative costs and expenses, but also ensuring that the general public does not shoulder the burden of paying them. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

        For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases have the meanings ascribed to them unless the context requires otherwise:

        B.     “Official police tow services provider” means a person who:

        3.     Is authorized by contract to collect from the registered or legal owner any one or more of the charges that are listed in the contract’s schedule of rates and charges for providing towing service.

        C.     “Person” means an individual, company, firm, association, trust, estate, partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity, however organized.

        E.     “Vehicle” has the same meaning as that term is defined in California Vehicle Code Section 670, or any successor law. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.040 Vehicle impound release fee.
        A.    The city establishes a vehicle impound release fee of one hundred fifty dollars, payable when a registered or legal owner seeks the release of a vehicle that the city’s police department impounded under state or local law.

10.60.050 Vehicle release.
        A.    All towed vehicles will require a tow release. All vehicles towed require the administrative impound release fee to be paid prior to the vehicle being released. This administrative fee is separate and apart from any charges imposed by the tow company.

        B.     Standard vehicle release requirements:

        1.     Valid (current) registration from the department of motor vehicles or a one day moving permit;

        2.     Legal or registered owner must be present with photo identification;

        3.     Proof of insurance on the vehicle being released;

        4.     Driver with valid driver’s license; and

        5.     Payment of the impound release fee. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.060 Post-impound hearing charge.
        The city establishes a post-impound hearing charge of one hundred fifty dollars, payable when a registered or legal owner submits to the city’s police department a written request for a hearing or an appeal related to the impounded vehicle’s removal, impoundment, storage, or release. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.070 Unpaid fee or charge—Civil debt.
        A.    The vehicle impound release fee under Section 10.60.040, and the post-impound-hearing charge under Section 10.60.060, are in addition to any one or more of:

        1.     The charges, fees, or fines that a registered or legal owner may owe the city under a California Vehicle Code provision or this code or both;

        2.     The charges that a registered or legal owner may own an official police tow services provider under the schedule or rates and charges contained in the provider’s contract.

        B.     When a person fails, neglects or refuses to pay the vehicle impound release fee under Section 10.60.040 for an impounded vehicle that qualifies for release or when a person otherwise pays that fee but later cancels or stops payment on it, and in either situation that fee’s payment is lawfully due and owing, the unpaid amount constitutes a debt owed to the city by that person, from whom the city may recover in a civil action.

        C.     When a person who seeks a post-impound hearing fails, neglects or refuses to pay the post-impound hearing charge under Section 10.60.060 or when a person otherwise pays that fee but later cancels or stops payment on it, and in either situation that fee’s payment is lawfully due and owing, the unpaid amount constitutes a debt owed to the city by that person, from whom the city may recover in a civil action. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.080 Fee and charge—Exceptions.
        The police department will not collect from a registered or legal owner the vehicle impound release fee under Section 10.60.040 or the post-impound hearing charge under Section 10.60.060, or both, under any of the following circumstances:

        A.    When the vehicle was:

        1.     Reported stolen and recovered; or

        2.     Impounded in error; or

        3.     Lien sold under Civil Code Sections 3068.1 to 3074 and Vehicle Code Section 22851 or any successor law, and the lien sale proceeds were insufficient to pay the tow provider’s total charges and administrative costs; or

        B.     When a court orders the waiver of the vehicle impound release fee or the post-impound hearing charge, or both.

        C.     When state law or this code exempts or excludes a registered owner or a legal owner from paying the vehicle impound release fee or the post-impound hearing charge, or both. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

 

10.60.090 Fee and charge—Refund.
        The police department will refund the impound release fee and the post-impound hearing charge to a registered or legal owner who paid the fee and charge, if the result of the post-impound hearing or appeal is that:

        A.    A reasonable ground for removing, impounding, or storing the vehicle did not exist; or

        B.     The facts disclosed at the hearing or in the appeal warrant the refund, in the opinion of the person conducting the hearing. (Ord. No. 759, § 4, 12-6-2010)

        B.     The chief of police, with the approval of the city manager, may request that the city council modify either the vehicle impound release fee or the post-impound hearing charge, or both, in order to:

        2.     Account for a change in the cost of impounding and releasing vehicles or conducting post-impound hearings and appeals, or both.

        B.     All equipment and antenna should be shrouded and where possible located behind any street signs located on the pole.

        C.     Only one SWF is permitted per support structure.

        D.    A minimum distance of one hundred fifty feet is required between small wireless facilities.

        E.     Installations should be located on poles that are located outside of the driveway and intersection sightlines. Installations should be located on poles that are located as close as feasible to shared property lines between two adjacent lots and not directly in front of residences and businesses.

        F.     Equipment should be located entirely on the pole in a vertical arrangement. Exterior mounted accessory equipment should be within a single arrangement not to exceed nine cubic feet in volume (exclusive of the concealing elements like shrouding). Required meters and disconnect switches that are infeasible to be shrouded for safety and/or accessibility reasons are excluded from this shrouding guideline.

        G.    All accessory equipment must be designed to not be visible to the maximum extent possible. When evaluating compliance with this section, the city engineer will consider whether other more preferred designs are technically feasible and other more appropriate sites potentially available. All applicants for a SWF permit must propose accessory equipment designs according to the following preferences, ordered from most preferred to least preferred:

        1.     Underground installation;

        2.     Pole-mounted installation (equipment should be located within poles whenever possible);

        3.     Ground-mounted installation:

        a.     Ground-mounted installation of equipment will not be permitted, unless: (i) the applicant demonstrates that pole-mounted or underground accessory equipment is not technically feasible and that no other site options reasonably exist that would support a SWF, or (ii) the city specifically finds that groundmounted installation of equipment would be more aesthetically desirable and consistent with the objectives of these guidelines than underground or pole mounted installation of accessory equipment.

        b.     Ground-mounted equipment may only be permitted in locations that do not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic and if the city engineer finds that the above-ground equipment would not unreasonably interfere with the public’s ability to use the right-of-way for uses that include without limitation travel, social, expressive uses and/or aesthetic values.

        c.     The city engineer may condition approval based on new or enhanced landscaping to conceal ground-mounted equipment.

        H.    All cables, wires and other connectors should be routed through conduits within poles whenever possible, and all external conduits, conduit attachments, cables, wires, and other connectors must be concealed from public view.

        I.      All SWF must include signage that accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the site name or identification number and a toll-free number to the owner/operator’s network operations center. SWF may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved by the city, required by law or recommended under existing and future FCC or other United States governmental agencies for compliance with radio frequency emissions regulations. Radio frequency notification signs should be placed where appropriate, and not at pedestrian eye level unless required by the FCC or other regulatory agencies.

        J.      Ground-mounted electric meters are prohibited.

        K.    Wireless facilities and all accessory equipment and transmission equipment must comply with all noise regulations and must not exceed, either individually or cumulatively, the applicable noise level standards in Crescent City Municipal Code.

        L.     Pole heights must be minimized and in no case may the maximum height of any facilities exceed thirty-five feet. Pole height is measured from the top of the foundation, which should be flush with the ground, to the top of the pole or top of the antenna, whichever is greater.

        M.    Small wireless facilities are required to incorporate reasonable and appropriate site security measures, such as locks and anti-climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft or vandalism. All SWF must be constructed from graffiti-resistant materials. The city engineer may require additional concealment elements as the city engineer finds necessary to blend the security measures and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment. The city engineer will not approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security measures.

        N.    Wireless facilities must not interfere with access to a fire hydrant, fire station, fire escape, water valve, underground vault, valve housing structure or any other public health or safety facility.

        O.    No person may install, use or maintain any facilities (in whole or in part) that rest upon, in or over any public right-of-way, when such installation, use or maintenance: (1) endangers or is reasonably likely to endanger the safety of persons or property; or (2) when such site or location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation purposes or other governmental use; or (3) when such facilities unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably impede the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including any legally parked or stopped vehicle, ingress into or egress from any residence or place of business, use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, permitted sidewalk dining, permitted street furniture and/or other objects permitted at or near the location where the wireless facilities are located. (Ord. 820 § 2, 2020)

        An applicant proposing to attach to a streetlight in the public right-of-way must comply with the following design standards:

        A.    Equipment should be painted, treated or finished to match existing streetlight pole aesthetics and materials in finish and color that are in the immediate vicinity of the proposed pole(s).

        B.     The antenna should be mounted at the top of the streetlight pole where the arm extends from the pole where feasible.

        C.     The top of the antenna if top-mounted should be no higher than forty-eight inches above the top of the existing pole.

        D.    All antennas should be shrouded. Antenna shroud should have an outer diameter of fifteen inches or less and measure no more than five cubic feet in size. The shroud should be no more than four feet tall, including antenna, radio head, mounting bracket, and all other hardware necessary for a complete installation.

        E.     Antenna shroud should be no more than thirty percent greater in diameter than the streetlight it is attached to and the transition between the pole and the shroud should be tapered.

        F.     All cables, wires, and other connectors should be hidden within the base and shaft of the streetlight. Where this is not feasible, the equipment should be installed in an underground vault. (Ord. 820 § 2, 2020)

 

12.44.130 Design guidelines specific to small wireless facilities installed on new poles.
        A.    New poles are only permitted if: (1) the applicant demonstrates that above-ground support structures near the project site either do not exist or are not reasonably available to the applicant; or (2) the city specifically finds that a new, non-replacement support structure would be more aesthetically desirable and consistent with the objectives of these guidelines than installations on existing structures near the project site.

        B.     Pole material and finishes should match the existing materials of the city standard streetlight poles.

        C.     Poles should be functioning streetlights and designed to resemble existing standalone streetlights in the vicinity.

        D.    When technically feasible, all antennas and associated equipment must fit within the diameter of the poles with no exterior wires or conduit. If all antennas and equipment cannot fit within the pole for technical reasons, then the installation will be subject to the standards above.

        E.     Antennas should be mounted on the top of the pole.

        F.     Relocated poles will be subject to guidelines in this section and their respective pole type section. (Ord. 820 § 2, 2020)

13.33.060 National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
        Users must comply with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards set forth at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405–471.

        A.    Where a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections E and F.

        B.     Where the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the pretreatment coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.

        C.     When wastewater subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).

        D.    A categorical industrial user may obtain a net or a gross adjustment to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard pursuant to this section.

        1.     Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s source water. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for source pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the source water) if the requirements of subsection (D)(2) of this section are met.

        2.     Criteria.

        a.     Either:

        i.      The applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards contained in 40 CFR, subchapter N, specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or

        ii.     The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of pollutants in the source waters.

        b.     Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease will not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user’s effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the source water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.

        c.     Credit will be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) adjusted under this section.

        d.     Credit will be granted only if the user demonstrates that the source water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result.

        E.     When a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1)(a) through (e) below.

        1.     To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:

        a.     Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;

        b.     Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;

        c.     Provide sufficient information to establish the user’s actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the user’s long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;

        d.     Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and

        e.     Have consistently complied with all applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request for equivalent mass limits.

        2.     An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:

        a.     Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;

        b.     Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;

        c.     Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify the pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (F)(1) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and

        d.     Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph (1)(a) of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.

        F.     When developing equivalent mass limits, the pretreatment coordinator:

        1.     Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;

        2.     Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and

        3.     May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section 13.33.100. The industrial user must also be in compliance with Section 13.33.710 regarding the prohibition of bypass.

        G.    The pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the Categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator.

        H.    Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated Categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.

        I.      Many Categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.

        J.      Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify the pretreatment coordinator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the pretreatment coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. (Ord. 757 § 2, 2010)

 

13.33.070 State Pretreatment Standards.
        State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter. (Ord. 757 § 2, 2010)

 

13.33.080 Local limits.
        The pretreatment coordinator is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). Local limits will be approved by city council resolution to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the daily maximum limits list (most recent local limits resolution) available at City Hall and on the city webpage (http://crescentcity.org/). The local limits apply at the point where wastewater is discharged to the POTW.

        The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations in addition to or instead of the concentration-based limitations. The pretreatment coordinator is authorized to set IU-specific limits for pollutants on a case-by-case basis. The loading allocation will be based on the discharger’s current loading, its need for a continued loading allocation, its ability to apply pretreatment to achieve certain discharge pollutant levels (i.e., treatability), or any other factor that the pretreatment coordinator determines is relevant. The pretreatment coordinator will ensure that the sum of the allocated loadings does not exceed the current maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL).

        To ensure that it does not allocate more than the MAIL, Crescent City will monitor loading from IUs with individual wastewater discharge permits. The city will monitor and compare actual loading to the allocated MAILs upon receipt of any discharge monitoring data on an annual basis.

        The pretreatment coordinator may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of Section 13.33.050. (Ord. 799 § 3, 2017; Ord. 767 § 4, 2012; Ord. 757 § 2, 2010)

 

13.33.090 City of Crescent City’s right of revision.
        The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent Standards or Requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter. (Ord. 757 § 2, 2010)

 

13.33.100 Dilution.
        A user must never increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 757 § 2, 2010)

 

Article 3. Pretreatment of Wastewater
13.33.110 Pretreatment facilities.
        Users must provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and to achieve compliance with all Categorical Pretreatment Standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section 13.33.060 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the pretreatment coordinator, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance must be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures must be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator for review, and must be acceptable to the pretreatment coordinator before those facilities are constructed. The review of plans and operating procedures does not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 757 § 3, 2010)

 

13.33.120 Additional pretreatment measures.
        A.    Whenever necessary in his or her judgment, the pretreatment coordinator may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage-waste streams from industrial-waste streams, and impose any other conditions that may be necessary to protect the POTW and ensure the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit may be issued for the purpose of flow equalization.

        C.     Grease, oil, and sand interceptors must be provided when, in the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, any or all are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units must be of a type and capacity approved by the pretreatment coordinator and must be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. These interceptors must be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at user’s expense.

        D.    The pretreatment coordinator may require users with the potential to discharge flammable substances to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. (Ord. 757 § 3, 2010)

 

13.33.130 Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans.
        The pretreatment coordinator must evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge or slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The pretreatment coordinator may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the pretreatment coordinator may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge or slug discharge control plan must include, at a minimum, the following:

        A.    Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

        B.     Description of stored chemicals;

        C.     Procedures for immediately notifying the pretreatment coordinator of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.33.370 of this chapter; and

        D.    Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.

        The procedures to be described include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. (Ord. 757 § 3, 2010)

 

13.33.140 Hauled wastewater.
        Septic-tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the pretreatment coordinator, and only at times as are established by the pretreatment coordinator. Septic waste must not violate Article 2 or any other requirements established by the city. The pretreatment coordinator may require septic-tank-waste haulers to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits or deny septage receiving at any time for any reasonable cause.

        The pretreatment coordinator may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits. The pretreatment coordinator may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits. The pretreatment coordinator in his or her discretion also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.

        Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the pretreatment coordinator. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the pretreatment coordinator. The pretreatment coordinator may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable Standards. The pretreatment coordinator may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.

        Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking manifest for every load. This manifest must include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. (Ord. 757 § 3, 2010)

 

13.33.150 Interceptor requirements.
        A.    Interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors must be provided when, in the opinion of the public works director or the pretreatment coordinator. They are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors are not required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the public works director or pretreatment coordinator and must be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. All interception units must be installed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. These interceptors must be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his or her sole expense. New and existing users that are determined by the public works director or pretreatment coordinator to have a reasonable potential to adversely impact the POTW must install a grease, oil or sand interceptor.

        1.     Users that are required to have a grease interceptor may be required to connect fixtures or drains that have a reasonable potential to allow fats, oils, and grease to be discharged to the POTW to an appropriately sized grease interceptor.

        2.     Users with garbage grinders must discharge the garbage grinder to a grease interceptor with a minimum capacity of one thousand gallons or remove the garbage grinder.

        3.     Users with dishwashers must discharge the dishwasher directly to the POTW or to a grease interceptor with a minimum capacity of seven hundred fifty gallons.

        4.     Accumulated grease and sediment must be removed as required. At a minimum gravity grease interceptors and grease traps must be cleaned when the combined depth of sediment and grease equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the total depth of the sediment, water, and grease. For multiple chambered interceptors the measurements of sediment and grease are to be performed in the final interceptor chamber prior to discharge. All other grease interceptors must be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.

        5.     Grease interceptors must be kept free of non-food waste including, but not limited to, grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, trash, towels, and rags.

        6.     The addition of chemicals, enzymes, emulsifiers, live bacteria or other grease cutters or additives used for purposes of grease reduction to a grease interceptor is specifically prohibited.

        7.     If the public works director or pretreatment coordinator determines that a grease interceptor is not being adequately cleaned or maintained, a correction notice may be issued requiring the deficiency be corrected within seven working days. Maintenance programs including BMPs and defined cleaning frequencies may be mandated. Users that fail to adhere to a maintenance program may be required to install additional pretreatment devices.

        8.     The city will develop and implement a fats, oils, and grease policy.

        B.     Time of Compliance. All commercial facilities and food establishments described in this section are required to install a sand and/or grease interceptor or grease trap within the sixty-day period after the first occurrence of any of the following events:

        1.     Transfer of any ownership or interest in the commercial facility;

        2.     The issuance by the county of any building permit for the construction, reconstruction or related work to be performed on the premises costing more than five thousand dollars;

        3.     The backup or discharge of raw sewage on or from the premises due to grease build up in their service lateral; or within

        4.     Ninety days after receiving written notice from the public works director or pretreatment coordinator of the necessity for installation of such facilities.

        C.     Monitoring and Reporting. All establishments having a grease trap or interceptor must maintain and clean this unit as recommended by the manufacturer. Each grease trap or interceptor must be regularly maintained by the proprietor or property owner and records kept at the site for inspection by the city. Maintenance will vary depending upon the size of the unit and grease loading. The property owner or proprietor must send a copy of the maintenance records to the city annually from the time of installation or some other agreed upon date by the city. At no time may the unit be allowed to become clogged with grease so as to create damage to the city collection or treatment facilities. The proprietor must develop a cleaning schedule sufficient to keep the unit functioning properly. Records of grease disposal to a collection agent must be made available to city personnel upon request.

        D.    Responsibility of Tenants. Where an owner of property lets premises to any other person as a tenant, if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this chapter. This provision is enforceable against the either or both the owner, tenant or both, without regard to any contractual arrangements as between the owner and tenant.

        E.     Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The city council may adopt reasonable charges and fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city’s pretreatment program which may include:

        1.     Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications.

        2.     Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user’s discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by the users.

        3.     Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction.

        4.     Fees for filing appeals.

        5.     Other fees that the city finds to be necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this section. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, finest and penalties chargeable by the city. (Ord. 767 § 3, 2012; Ord. 757 § 3, 2010)

 

Article 4. Individual Wastewater Discharge Permits/General Permits
13.33.160 Wastewater analysis.
        When requested by the pretreatment coordinator, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within twenty-four hours of the request. The pretreatment coordinator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.170 Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit requirement.
        A.    A significant industrial user must not discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit from the pretreatment coordinator, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to Section 13.33.180 of this chapter may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator may require other users to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

        C.     Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Articles 10 through 12 of this chapter. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.180 Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting—Existing connections.
        Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, must, within ninety days after the effective date, apply to the pretreatment coordinator for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit in accordance with Section 13.33.200 of this chapter, and must not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after ninety days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit issued by the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.190 Individual wastewater discharge and general permitting—New connections.
        Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, in accordance with Section 13.33.200 of this chapter, must be filed at least ninety days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.200 Individual wastewater discharge and general permit application contents.
        A.    All users required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit must submit a permit application. Users that are eligible may request a general permit under Section 13.33.210. The pretreatment coordinator may require users to submit the following information as part of a permit application:

        B.     Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.210 Wastewater discharge permitting—General permits.
        A.    At the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator, the pretreatment coordinator may use general permits to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must:

        1.     Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;

        2.     Discharge the same types of wastes;

        3.     Require the same effluent limitations;

        4.     Require the same or similar monitoring; and

        5.     In the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits.

        B.     To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with Section 13.33.350(B) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, and any other information the POTW finds to be appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after the pretreatment coordinator has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with Section 13.33.350(B).

        C.     The pretreatment coordinator will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to support the coordinator’s determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in subsection (A)(1) to (5) and applicable state regulations, and a copy of the user’s written request for coverage for three years after the expiration of the general permit.

        D.    The pretreatment coordinator may not control an SIU through a general permit where the facility is subject to production-based categorical Pretreatment Standards or categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula (Section 13.33.060(D)) or net/gross calculations (Section 13.33.060(E)). (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.220 Application signatories and certifications.
        A.    All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports, and certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the certification statement in Section 13.33.450(A).

        B.     The designation of an authorized representative must be kept current.

        C.     A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the pretreatment coordinator pursuant to Section 13.33.040 definition of significant industrial user subsection (3) must annually submit the signed certification statement in Section 13.33.450(B). (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

13.33.230 Individual wastewater discharge and general permit decisions.
        The pretreatment coordinator will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within thirty days of receipt of a complete permit application, the pretreatment coordinator will determine whether to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit. The city may deny any application for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit that does not meet the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 757 § 4, 2010)

 

Article 5. Individual Wastewater Discharge/General Permit Issuance
13.33.240 Individual wastewater discharge and general permit duration.
        An individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit is issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of the permit. An individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator. Each individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

        9.     Other conditions included by the pretreatment coordinator to ensure compliance with this chapter, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.260 Process for issuing permits.
        A.    Notice of Intent to Issue Permit. At least fifteen days before the proposed date of issuance, the pretreatment coordinator will publish in a newspaper(s) of general circulation in Del Norte County and on city’s webpage, a notice of intent to issue a pretreatment permit. The notice will state one or more locations where the draft permit may be reviewed and an address where written comments may be submitted.

        B.     Notice that Permit Has Been Issued. Within five business days of issuing a pretreatment permit under this chapter, the pretreatment coordinator will publish in a newspaper of general circulation in Del Norte County a notice that the permit has been issued.

        C.     Reconsideration. Any person, including the user, may petition the pretreatment coordinator to reconsider the terms of an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit within fifteen days of notice of its issuance. Failure to submit a timely petition for reconsideration is a waiver of administrative reconsideration.

        1.     The petition must be in writing but it does not need to be in any particular form. The petition, must state specifically the provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the nature of the alternative condition, if any, appellant seeks to place in the individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit.

        2.     The effectiveness of the individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit is not stayed pending the resolution of the petition.

        3.     The pretreatment coordinator must act on the petition for reconsideration within fifteen days of its filing. If the pretreatment coordinator fails to act within fifteen days, a petition for reconsideration is deemed to be denied.

        4.     Any party aggrieved by the decision of the pretreatment coordinator on a petition for reconsideration may appeal that decision to the city council of the city of Crescent City. The appeal must be in writing, must be accompanied by an appeal fee in the amount established by the city’s schedule of fees. The appeal and the fee must be filed with city clerk within fifteen days of the final action of the pretreatment coordinator.

        5.     The city council must conduct a hearing of the appeal within forty-five days of the filing of the appeal and must render its decision in writing within thirty days thereafter. The action of the city council is the final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.270 Permit modification.
        A.    On his or her own initiative or upon application of the user, the pretreatment coordinator may modify an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, any of the following reasons:

        1.     To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local Pretreatment Standards or Requirements;

        2.     To address significant alterations or additions to the user’s operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the issuance of the individual wastewater discharge permit;

        3.     A change has been or will be made in the POTW that requires or will require either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;

        4.     Information has been received by the pretreatment coordinator indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the city’s POTW, city personnel, beneficial sludge use or the receiving waters;

        5.     There has been a violation of any term or condition of the individual wastewater discharge permit;

        6.     The user has made a misrepresentation or has failed to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting;

        7.     There has been a revision of or a grant of variance from Categorical Pretreatment Standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;

        8.     To correct typographical or other errors in the individual wastewater discharge permit; or

        9.     To reflect an approved transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with Section 13.33.280.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator may modify a general permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:

        1.     To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local Pretreatment Standards or Requirements;

        2.     A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;

        3.     To correct typographical or other errors in the individual wastewater discharge permit; or

        4.     To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with Section 13.33.280. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.280 Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit transfer.
        Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage under general permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least ninety days advance notice to the pretreatment coordinator and the pretreatment coordinator approves the individual wastewater discharge permit or the general permit coverage transfer. The notice to the pretreatment coordinator must include a written certification by the new owner or operator that:

        A.    Fully identifies the new owner or operator;

        B.     States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility’s operations and processes;

        C.     Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and

        D.    Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.

        Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the individual wastewater discharge permit or coverage under the general permit void as of the date of facility transfer. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.290 Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit revocation.
        The pretreatment coordinator may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit or coverage under a general permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following causes:

        A.    Failure to notify the pretreatment coordinator of significant changes to the wastewater prior to discharge;

        M.    Violation of any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or this chapter.

        Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage under general permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits issued to a user are void upon the issuance of a new individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to that user. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.300 Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit reissuance.
        A user with an expiring individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit must apply for individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, including all required information and any fees, in accordance with Section 13.33.200 of this chapter, at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

13.33.310 Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
        A.    If another local agency, or a user located within another local agency, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the city must enter into an inter-agency agreement with the contributing local agency.

        B.     Prior to entering into an agreement required by subsection A, the pretreatment coordinator shall request the following information from the contributing local agency:

        1.     A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to the POTW by the contributing local agency;

        2.     An inventory of all users located within the contributing local agency that are discharging to the POTW; and

        3.     Such other information as the pretreatment coordinator may deem necessary.

        C.     An inter-agency agreement, as required by subsection A, must contain the following conditions:

        1.     A requirement that the contributing local agency adopt a sewer use ordinance that is at least as stringent as this chapter and local limits, including required baseline monitoring reports (BMRs) which are at least as stringent as those set out in Section 13.33.080. The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the city’s ordinance or local limits;

        2.     A requirement for the contributing local agency to submit a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;

        3.     A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation activities, including individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit issuance, inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing local agency, which of these activities will be conducted by the city, and which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing local agency and the city;

        4.     A requirement for the contributing local agency to provide the pretreatment coordinator with access to all information that the contributing local agency obtains as part of its pretreatment activities;

        5.     Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing local agency’s wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW;

        6.     Requirements for monitoring the contributing local agency’s discharge;

        7.     A provision ensuring that the pretreatment coordinator will have access to the facilities of users located within the contributing local agency’s jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other deemed necessary by the pretreatment coordinator; and

        8.     A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms of the inter-agency agreement. (Ord. 757 § 5, 2010)

 

Article 6. Reporting Requirements
13.33.320 Baseline monitoring reports.
        A.    Within one hundred eighty days after either the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW must submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report that contains the information listed in subsection B. At least ninety days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable Categorical Standard, must submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report that contains the information listed in subsection B. A new source must report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable Categorical Standards. A new source also must provide estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.

        B.     Users subject to subsection A of this must provide the following information:

        1.     All that information required by Section 13.33.200(A)(1)(a), (2), (3)(a), and (6).

        2.     Measurement of Pollutants.

        a.     The user must provide the information required in Section 13.33.200(A)(7)(a) through (d).

        b.     The user must take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.

        c.     Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure all the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data must be submitted to the city.

        d.     Sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with Section 13.33.410.

        e.     The pretreatment coordinator may allow the submission of a baseline report that utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.

        f.      The baseline report must indicate the time, date, and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and must certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.

        3.     Compliance Certification. A statement, prepared by the user or user’s authorized representative indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

        4.     Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required in order to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule must not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in Section 13.33.330.

        5.     Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with Section 13.33.450(A) and signed by an authorized representative as defined in Section 13.33.040. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.330 Compliance schedule progress reports.
        The following conditions apply to the compliance schedule required by Section 13.33.320(B)(4):

        A.    The schedule must contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable Pretreatment Standards. (Such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);

        B.     No increment referred to above may exceed nine months;

        C.     The user must submit a progress report to the pretreatment coordinator no later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if applicable, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and

        D.    No more than nine months may elapse between these progress reports to the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.340 Reports on compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadline.
        Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a new discharge, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to the Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements must submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report containing the information described in Sections 13.33.200(A)(6), (7), and 13.33.320(B)(2). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in Section 13.33.060 the report must contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of operation, this report must include the user’s actual production during each sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.33.450(A) of this chapter. All sampling will be done in conformance with Section 13.33.420. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.350 Periodic compliance reports.
        A.    Except as specified in subsection C, at least twice per year prior to June 30 and December 31, all significant industrial users must, submit reports detailing the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge that are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution-prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or the Pretreatment Standard as required to determine the compliance status of the user. The pretreatment coordinator may increase the frequency of this reporting.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator may authorize an industrial user subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant if the industrial user has demonstrated that the pollutant is neither present nor reasonably expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:

        1.     The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable Categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.

        2.     The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See Section 13.33.200(A)(8).

        3.     In demonstrating that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s process wastewater, prior to any treatment at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.

        4.     The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with Section 13.33.040, and include the certification statement in Section 13.33.450(A).

        5.     Non-detectable sample results may be used to demonstrate that a pollutant is not present only if the EPA-approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.

        6.     Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the pretreatment coordinator must be included as a condition or addendum in the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the pretreatment coordinator for three years after expiration of the waiver.

        7.     After approval of a monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s permit by the pretreatment coordinator, the industrial user must certify on each report, using the statement in Section 13.33.450(C), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user or that the pollutant has been found to be or is expected to be present.

        8.     In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection A, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the pretreatment coordinator, and must notify the pretreatment coordinator.

        9.     This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment Standard.

        C.     The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports, see Section subsection A, to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the EPA or the state, where the industrial user’s total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:

        1.     Two hundred fifty gallons per day, as measured by a continuous effluent-flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches;

        2.     Generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 0.14 pounds per day and total suspended solids (TSS) of 0.24 pounds per day; or

        3.     0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard for which approved local limits were developed in accordance with Section 13.33.080.

        Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in Article 9 of this chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, decreasing the reporting requirement for that industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

        D.    All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.33.450(A).

        E.     All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities must be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order is not grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.

        F.     If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the pretreatment coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in Section 13.33.420, the results of that more frequent monitoring must be included in the report. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.360 Reports of changed conditions.
        Each user must notify the pretreatment coordinator of any significant changes to the user’s operations or system that might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty days before the change.

        A.    The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 13.33.200.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under Section 13.33.300 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under Section 13.33.270 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.370 Reports of problems or potential problems.
        In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW:

        A.    The user must immediately telephone and notify the pretreatment coordinator of the incident. This notification must include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.

        B.     Within five days following the discharge, the user must, unless the report is waived by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. This report does not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that is incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor does the report relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability that may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.

        C.     A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place, advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection A. Employers shall ensure that any employee who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

        D.    Significant industrial users are required to notify the pretreatment coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.380 Reports from unpermitted users.
        A user who is not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit must provide reports to the pretreatment coordinator that the pretreatment coordinator may require. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.390 Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
        If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation has occurred in the past, the user must notify the pretreatment coordinator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user must also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in the place of the industrial user. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.400 Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
        A.    Any user who commences the discharge of waste that would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the state hazardous-waste authorities, in writing, of that fact. This notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred kilograms of this waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification must also contain the following information to the extent the information is known and readily available to the user: (1) an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; (2) an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and (3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection is required to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 13.33.360. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections 13.33.230, 13.33.340 and 13.33.350.

        B.     users are exempt from the requirements of subsection A, during any calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than these quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.

        C.     If new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA are imposed that identify additional characteristics of hazardous waste or list any additional substance as a hazardous waste, a user must notify the pretreatment coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of any such substance within ninety days of the effective date of such regulations.

        D.    If notification is made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of pollutants generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

        E.     This section does not create a right to discharge any substance. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.410 Analytical requirements.
        All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be reported as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report must be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless alternate techniques are specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA has determined that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.420 Sample collection.
        Information provided to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling performed during the period covered by the report. Samples must be representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period and subject to the following:

        A.    Except as indicated in subsections B and C, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and applicable EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

        B.     Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sample techniques.

        C.     For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in Sections 13.33.320 and 13.33.340, as referenced 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the pretreatment coordinator may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 13.33.350, under 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.430 Date of receipt of reports.
        Written reports are considered submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report governs. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

13.33.440 Recordkeeping.
        A.    users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter must retain and make available for inspection and copying all records of information developed pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information developed pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under Section 13.33.080. Records must show with respect to the record:

        1.     The date;

        2.     Exact place;

        3.     Method;

        4.     Time of sampling;

        5.     The name of the person(s) taking the samples;

        6.     The dates analyses were performed;

        7.     Who performed the analyses;

        8.     The analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of such analyses.

        B.     These records shall remain available for a minimum period of three years. This period is automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or if the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

(Ord. 757 § 6, 2010)

 

Article 7. Compliance Monitoring
13.33.460 Right of entry—Inspection and sampling.
        The pretreatment coordinator has the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with the requirements of this chapter and with any individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit or order issued under this chapter. Users must allow the pretreatment coordinator ready access to the entire premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

        A.    Where a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user must make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the pretreatment coordinator will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing his or her responsibilities under this chapter.

        B.     The pretreatment coordinator has the right to set up on the user’s property, or to require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.

        C.     The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment must be maintained at all times in proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality must be calibrated quarterly to ensure their accuracy.

        D.    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled must be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the pretreatment coordinator and must not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access must be borne by the user.

        E.     Unreasonable delay in providing the pretreatment coordinator access to the user’s premises is a violation of this chapter.

        F.     There must be ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities must be provided in accordance with the pretreatment coordinator’s requirements and with all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities must be constructed and maintained in a manner so as to enable the pretreatment coordinator to perform independent monitoring activities. (Ord. 757 § 7, 2010)

 

13.33.470 Search warrants.
        If the pretreatment coordinator has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part of the premises, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or with any permit or order issued under the ordinance, or to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the pretreatment coordinator may seek issuance of a search warrant from any Magistrate as defined by, California Penal Code Section 808, per California Penal Code Section 1528. (Ord. 757 § 7, 2010)

 

Article 8. Confidential Information
13.33.480 Confidential information.
        Information and data with respect to a user that is contained in reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, general permits, and that is or may be obtained from monitoring programs and from the pretreatment coordinator’s inspection and sampling activities, is available to the public without restriction, except as follows. If the user is able to demonstrate to the pretreatment coordinator that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under the California Public Records Act, and requests that the information be kept confidential, the pretreatment coordinator must withhold the information. Any request to keep the information confidential must be made at the time of submission of the information or data and must be accompanied by an agreement to defend and indemnify the city in the event that litigation is brought by any person challenging the city’s withholding of the information. Even in cases where portions of a report are not available for inspection by the public, they may be made available upon the request of governmental agencies whose jurisdiction is related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302, are not recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 757 § 8, 2010)

 

Article 9. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance
13.33.490 Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
        The pretreatment coordinator will publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation in Del Norte County, a list of the users, if any, that at any time during the previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. The term significant noncompliance may be applied to any significant industrial users or an industrial user that violates subsection C, D or H of this section and means:

        A.    Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed, by any magnitude, a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in Article 2;

        B.     Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Article 2 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD5, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);

        C.     Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as defined by Article 2 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the pretreatment coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;

        D.    Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment coordinator’s exercise of his or her emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

        E.     Failure to meet, within ninety days of the scheduled date, a scheduled compliance milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

        F.     Failure to provide within forty-five days after the due date any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

        G.    Failure to promptly and accurately report noncompliance; or

        H.    Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the pretreatment coordinator determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 757 § 9, 2010)

 

Article 10. Administrative Enforcement Remedies
13.33.500 Notification of violation.
        If the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, must be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator. Submission of the plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violation. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the pretreatment coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.510 Consent orders.
        The pretreatment coordinator may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. These agreements must include a description of the specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 13.33.530 and 13.33.540 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.520 Show cause hearing.
        The pretreatment coordinator may order a user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the city’s administrative hearing officer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice must be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the proposed action, and the order that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting must be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user and required by Section 13.33.220(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.530 Compliance orders.
        If the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user, directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified time, the right to discharge may be suspended unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order will not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order does not bar and is not a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.540 Cease and desist orders.
        If the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the pretreatment coordinator may issue an order directing the user to cease and desist the violations and directing the user to:

        A.    Comply immediately with all requirements; and

        B.     Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order does not bar and is not a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.550 Administrative fines.
        A.    If the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the city may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.

        B.     Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half percent per month. A lien against the user’s property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.

        C.     Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The pretreatment coordinator may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.

        D.    Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.560 Emergency suspensions.
        The pretreatment coordinator may immediately suspend a user’s right to discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever a suspension of that right is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to endanger the health or welfare of any person or persons. The pretreatment coordinator may also immediately suspend a user’s right to discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or that endangers the environment.

        A.    Any user notified of a suspension of its right to discharge must immediately stop discharging. In the event of a user’s failure immediately and voluntarily comply with the suspension order, the pretreatment coordinator may take such steps as are necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage or threat to the POTW, its receiving waters, person or persons or the environment. The pretreatment coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the period of endangerment has passed, except when the termination proceedings in Section 13.33.570 have been initiated against the user.

        B.     A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent danger shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Section 13.33.520 or 13.33.570.

        Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

13.33.570 Termination of discharge.
        In addition to the provisions in Section 13.33.290 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:

        A.    Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit conditions;

        B.     Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

        C.     Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;

        D.    Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or

        E.     Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Article 2 of this chapter.

        Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.33.520 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the pretreatment coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 757 § 10, 2010)

 

Article 11. Judicial Enforcement Remedies
13.33.580 Injunctive relief.
        When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition a Magistrate as defined by, California Penal Code Section 808, per California Penal Code Section 1528, of state of California, through the city’s attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, the general permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The pretreatment coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 757 § 11, 2010)

 

13.33.590 Civil penalties.
        A.    A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of not less more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

        B.     The city may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.

        C.     In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.

        D.    Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 816 § 3, 2019; Ord. 757 § 11, 2010)

 

13.33.600 Criminal prosecution.
        A.    A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both as per California Penal Code Section 19.

        B.     A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty, at a minimum of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.

        C.     A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit, or general permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

        D.    In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be guilty of a felony and punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than sixteen months, or both as per California Penal Code Section 18 et seq. (Ord. 757 § 11, 2010)

 

13.33.610 Remedies nonexclusive.
        The remedies provided for in, this ordinance are not exclusive. The city may pursue any lawful remedy or any combination of lawful remedies that is available against a noncompliant user. The enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the “city of Crescent City, California Enforcement Response Plan” June 2013 (Revised February 2017) or most recent version. A copy of the most recent Enforcement Response Plan is available at City Hall and at the city webpage (http://crescentcity.org/). However, the pretreatment coordinator may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.

Article 13. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
13.33.690 Upset.
        A.    For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the control of the user. Upset does not mean noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance.

        B.     An upset is an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of subsection C, are met.

        C.     A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous, operating logs, or other competent evidence that:

        1.     An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

        2.     The facility at the time of the upset was being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

        3.     The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:

        a.     A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance,

        b.     The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue, and

        c.     Steps that have been, are being or are planned to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

        D.    In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

        E.     A user may request a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards.

        F.     A user must control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the pretreatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 757 § 13, 2010)

 

13.33.700 Prohibited discharge standards.
        A user has an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 13.33.050(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Sections 13.33.050(B) (excluding numbers (1), (2) and (8)), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:

        A.    A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or

        B.     No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. (Ord. 757 § 13, 2010)

 

13.33.710 Bypass.
        A.    For the purposes of this section:

        1.     Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user’s pretreatment facility.

        2.     Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the POTW that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. “Severe property damage” does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

        B.     A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance. These permitted bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this section.

        C.     Bypass Notifications.

        1.     If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it must submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass.

        2.     A user must submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twelve hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission must also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission must contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass.

        D.    Bypass.

        1.     Except as expressly provided in this chapter, bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

        a.     Bypass was required to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or substantial damage to property not belonging to the user;

        b.     There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during scheduled periods of equipment shut down. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during scheduled periods of equipment shutdown or preventive maintenance; and

        c.     The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section.

        2.     The pretreatment coordinator may give prior approval to an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the pretreatment coordinator determines that the bypass will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section. (Ord. 757 § 13, 2010)

 

Article 14. Charges and Fees
13.33.720 Pretreatment charges and fees.

        G.    Charges for industrial users may also be based on the pounds of BOD and suspended solids and any other applicable waste loadings discharged to the sewer each billing period determined in accordance with this chapter. Special charges may be made to reimburse the city for abnormal costs incurred because of other pollutants in the wastewater. Surcharges for excessive strength industrial wastewater will be established by resolution. The most recent version of the surcharges for excessive strength industrial wastewater will be available at City Hall at the city webpage (http://crescentcity.org/).

        C.     A piggyback contract may be utilized when the contract is a result of:

        1.     Competitive bid procedures, such as in purchasing from the federal, California State or county governments, including state of California and agencies of counties, cities and special districts in the state of California; and

14.20.020 Economical approach for purchases.
        Consideration will be given to the most economical approach for purchases, including, but not limited to, the following options:

        A.    Consolidating or breaking out purchases;

        B.     Lease versus purchase options;

        C.     State and local intergovernmental or inter-entity agreements for procurement or use of common or shared goods or services;

        F.     Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary purchases; and

        G.    Any other appropriate analysis. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.030 Eligible contractors.
        A.    Contracts will only be awarded to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.

        B.     The city will not award to any person or firm that is debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in federal assistance programs or activities. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.040 Procurement records.
        The city will maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.050 Open and fair competition.
        A.    All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of this section. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bid, or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.

        B.     Situations considered to be restrictive of competition are prohibited. Such situations include, but are not limited to, the following:

        1.     Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;

        2.     Requiring unnecessary experience and/or excessive bonding;

        3.     Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;

        4.     Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;

        5.     Organizational conflicts of interest;

        6.     Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and

        7.     Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.060 Geographical preference prohibited.
        No geographical preference is permitted in any procurement that uses federal funds, except in those cases where applicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. When contracting for architectural and engineering services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.

Such description may not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product, or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications will be avoided if possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description may be used. The specific features of the named brand which must be met must be clearly stated.

        B.     Solicitations must identify all requirements which the bidders must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

        C.     The city must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition.

        D.    The city must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.080 Procurement methods—Additional requirements.
        A.    Procurement by Micro-Purchase Method. In addition to all other requirements contained in this chapter, to the extent practicable, micro-purchases of supplies or services, as defined by 2 CFR 200.67 and as amended from time to time, must be distributed equitably among qualified vendors.

        B.     Procurement by Small Purchase Method. In addition to all other requirements contained in this chapter, price or rate quotations for small purchases defined as those purchases of services, supplies or other property, that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in 2 CFR 200.88 and as amended from time to time, must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.

        C.     Procurement by Formal Bidding. Public projects using federal funds which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold must use the formal bidding (sealed bid) method set forth in this chapter. In addition, the following provisions also apply:

        1.     A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in the bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of.

        2.     Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.

        D.    Requests for Qualifications. Requests for qualifications (RFQ) may only be used in the procurement of architectural or engineering services. The RFQ method may not be used to procure other types of services, even though architectural or engineering firms may be a potential source to perform the work. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.090 Minority and women-owned businesses.
        The city must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible. Affirmative steps include:

        A.    Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises on solicitation lists;

        B.     Assuring that small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;

        C.     Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises;

        D.    Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises;

        E.     Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

        F.     Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in subsections A through E of this section. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.100 Contract cost and price.
        A.    Time and Materials Contracts. The city may use a time and materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. If such a contract is used, the city will assert a high degree of oversight to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.

        B.     Cost or Price Analysis. For procurements in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, the city must perform a cost or price analysis prior to receiving bids or proposals.

        C.     Negotiation When No Competition. The city must negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract for which there is no price competition, and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor’s investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

        D.    Prohibited Method of Contracting. Cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting must not be used. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.110 Contract provisions—Required.
        Each contract that the city enters into as a result of a procurement subject to this chapter, must contain all applicable provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200-Contract Provisions for non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.20.120 Federal conflict of interest prohibition.
        No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. The officers, employees, and agents of the city may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. There is no real or apparent conflict of interest if the financial interest was not substantial or the gift was an unsolicited item of nominal value. When determining whether a financial interest is “not substantial” or if an unsolicited item is of “nominal value,” the materiality standards set forth in the California Code of Regulations (2 CCR Section 18700, et seq.) pursuant to the California Political Reform Act (Government Code Section 81000, et seq.) shall govern. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

14.24.010 Application.
        The protest procedures contained in this chapter apply to formal sealed bids and competitive proposals only.

Chapter 14.28 EXCEPTIONS TO PROCUREMENT RULES
14.28.010 Emergency procurement.
        In the event of an emergency as defined herein, the city manager may order the suspension of normal procurement procedures for projects, goods or services related to the abatement of the impacts or effects of such emergency. The city council will, if possible, ratify such emergency suspension of procedures at the next properly noticed council meeting following the emergency procurement and consider whether further suspension of procedures is required to abate the impacts of the emergency. An emergency may be deemed to exist if:

        A.    There is a public calamity such as a fire, flood, earthquake, storm, or similar disaster that poses a serious threat to the public safety; or

        B.     There is an immediate need to prepare for national or local defense; or

        C.     An essential operation or city service affecting the public health, welfare or safety would be greatly hampered if adherence to the prescribed purchasing procedures would cause undue delay in procurement of the needed item or service. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

 

14.28.020 Sole source procurement.
        A.    In the event the contract or purchase contemplated is only capable of being performed by a sole provider such as a public utility or the holder of an exclusive patent or franchise, for purchase of unique or innovative goods or services including but not limited to computer software and technology, or for purchase of goods or services when there is a demonstrated need for compatibility with an existing item or service, then the contract or purchase shall be exempt from normal procurement procedures as outlined in this title.

        B.     A sole source may be designated when it is apparent that a needed product or service is uniquely available from the source, or for all practical purposes, it is justifiably in the best interest of the city. Under these circumstances, city bidding requirements may be dispensed with when the services or goods are only available from one source either because:

        1.     The brand or trade name article, goods, or product or proprietary service is the only one which will properly meet the needs of the city; or

        2.     The item or service is unique and available only from a sole source; or

        3.     The item or service is designed to match others already in use or necessary to be compatible with others already in use.

        C.     Each sole source procurement must be documented in a manner to clearly articulate the justification for the sole source procurement. The city manager must approve all sole source determinations. (Ord. 808 § 2, 2019)

Chapter 14.32 SURPLUS SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT
14.32.010 Authority to sell surplus supplies and equipment.

Chapter 15.32 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
15.32.005 Statutory authorization.
        The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Crescent City does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018)

 

15.32.010 Findings and purpose.
        A.    The flood hazard areas of the city of Crescent City have been subject to periodic inundation which has resulted in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which has adversely affected the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood height sand velocities also contributes to flood losses.

        B.     It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

        1.     To protect human life and health;

        2.     To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

        3.     To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

        4.     To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

        5.     To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

        6.     To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blight areas;

        7.     To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

        8.     To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

        C.     In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods, provisions, and regulations for:

        1.     Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

        2.     Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

        3.     Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

        4.     Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

        5.     Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018; Ord. 625, 1988; Ord. 610, 1986)

15.32.030 General provisions.
        A.    This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Crescent City.

        B.     The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through the Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report titled “The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Crescent City” dated September 29, 1986, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) dated November 23, 1982, and all subsequent amendments and revisions as adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas that allow implementation of this chapter which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The Flood Insurance Study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at Crescent City Public Works Department, 377 J Street, Crescent City, California. This Flood Insurance Study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter an may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator.

        C.     No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

        D.    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

        E.     In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

        1.     Considered as minimum requirements;

        2.     Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

        3.     Deemed neither to limit nor appeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

        F.     The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result reliant on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

        G.    This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018; Ord. 735 § 1, 2008; Ord. 682 § 5, 1999; Ord. 625, 1988; Ord. 610, 1986)

 

15.32.040 Administration.
        A.    A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development any construction, development or substantial improvements, including manufactured homes begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.32.030. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the director of public works and the applicant shall provide the following minimum information: plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, and showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials and equipment, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

        1.     Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (NAVD 1988 Datum), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

        2.     Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (NAVD 1988 Datum) to which any structure will be floodproofed;

        3.     Base flood elevation information as specified in Section 15.32.020 of this chapter;

        4.     Location of the regulatory floodway, when applicable;

        5.     All appropriate certifications listed in Section 15.32.050 of this chapter; and

        6.     Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

        B.     The director of community development is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

        1.     Review of all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantially damaged of existing structures;

        2.     Review of all development permits to determine whether all other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

        3.     Review of all permits to determine that the site is reasonably safe from flooding;

        4.     Confirm that the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Crescent City;

        5.     Confirm that all letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

        6.     Review of all proposals for the development of five parcels or more to assure that the flood discharge exiting the development after construction is equal to or less than the flood discharge at the location prior to development.

        7.     For a crawlspace foundation, the location and total net area (square inches) of flood vent openings must be as required in Section 15.32.050(A)(5).

        8.     Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

        9.     Within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the city’s FIRM, obtain the elevation in relation to mean sea level of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member (excluding pilings and columns) of all new, substantially improved, and substantially damaged structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement.

        C.     The city shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed:

        1.     The certification required in Sections 15.32.050(A)(3)(d), (E)(2), (F)(4) and (H)(1); and

        2.     Certification of the elevation of the top of lowest floor, including basement for development in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, floodproofed elevation for non-residential structures in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, and the elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal support member for structures in Zones V1-30, V, and VE, is required at that point where the footings are set and slab poured. Failure to submit elevation certification shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. As-built plans certifying the elevation of the lowest natural adjacent grade is also required;

        4.     The certification required in Section 15.32.050(A)(3)(d).

        D.    It is the responsibility of the director of community development to:

        1.     Notify adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It is required that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse be maintained by the community.

        2.     Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.32.030(C).

        3.     Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the director of community development shall submit or assure that the permit the applicant submits contains technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). All LOMRs for flood control projects shall be approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits shall not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs may allow construction of flood control projects and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

        4.     Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

        E.     The city floodplain administrator will provide interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.32.060.

        F.     The maintenance of any and all flood protection measures (levees, dikes, dams or reservoirs) will be required of the jurisdiction where such measures provide protection. If these measures are privately owned, an operation or maintenance plan will be required of the owner to be on file with the director of community development. The community is required to acknowledge all maintenance plans by the adoption of such plans by ordinance.

        G.    The local agency or board responsible for reviewing all proposals for new development shall weigh all requests for future floodplain development to ensure that the city’s general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. Consideration of the following elements are required before approval:

        1.     Determination of whether or not a proposed development is in or affects a known floodplain;

        2.     Inform the public of the proposed activity;

        3.     Determine if there is a practicable alternative or site for the proposed activity;

        4.     Identify impact of the activity on the floodplain;

        5.     Provide a plan to mitigate the impact of the activity with provisions in subsection (B)(4) of this section.

        H.    When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.32.030(B), the director of public works shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 15.32.050. A base flood elevation will be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication. FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018; Ord. 682 § 5, 1999; Ord. 625, 1988; Ord. 610, 1986)

 

15.32.050 Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
        A.    In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:

        1.     Anchoring.

        a.     All new construction, substantial improvements, and substantially damaged structures, including manufactured homes, shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure, resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

        b.     All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of subsection F of this section.

        2.     Construction Materials and Methods.

        a.     All new construction, substantial improvements, and substantially damaged structures, including manufactured homes, shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage, at a minimum to the one percent annual chance base flood elevation.

        b.     All new construction, and substantial improvements, and substantially damaged structures shall use methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

        c.     All new construction, substantial improvements, and substantially damaged structures shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

        3.     Elevation and Floodproofing—Residential Construction.

        a.     New construction, substantial improvement, and substantially damaged structures of any residential structure in a Zone AE, AH, or A1-30 shall have the top of lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.

        b.     New construction, substantial improvement, and substantially damaged structures of any residential structure in a Zone V, VE, or V1-30 shall have the bottom of the lowest horizontal support member elevated to or above the base flood elevation.

        c.     New construction, substantial improvement, and substantially damaged structures of any residential structure in an Unnumbered/Approximate A Zone, without BFEs specified on the FIRM, shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A base flood elevation will be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication. FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.

        d.     Upon completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be certified by a registered professional civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and verified by the local building inspector that the elevation requirements have been met. Notification of compliance shall be recorded as set forth in Section 15.32.040(C).

        4.     Elevation and Floodproofing—Nonresidential Construction.

        a.     Nonresidential construction, substantially improved, and substantially damaged non- residential structures shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (A)(3) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, or:

        i.      Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

        ii.     Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

        iii.    Be certified by a registered professional civil engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

        5.     Flood Vent Openings. For all new construction, substantial improvements, and substantially damaged structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for non-engineered flood vent openings meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional civil engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

        a.     A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

        b.     The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above natural grade;

        c.     Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; and

        d.     Buildings with more than one enclosed area must have openings on exterior walls for each area to allow water to directly enter.

        B.     Areas subject to alluvial fan flooding have irregular flow paths that result in erosion of existing channels and the undermining of fill material. Those areas are identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map as AO zones with velocities.

        1.     All structures must be securely anchored to minimize the impact of the flood and sediment damage.

        2.     All new construction, and substantial improvements, must be elevated on pilings, columns, or armored fill so that the bottom lowest floor beam is elevated at or above the depth number.

        3.     Use of all fill materials must be armored to protect the material from the velocity of the flood flow.

        4.     All proposals for subdivision development must provide a mitigation plan that identifies the engineering methods used to:

        a.     Protect structures from erosion and scour caused by the velocity of the flood flow;

        b.     Capture or transport flood and sediment flow through the subdivision to a safe point of disposition.

        5.     All manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in subsection F of this section.

        C.     Standards for Storage of Materials and Equipment.

        1.     The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life, is prohibited.

        2.     Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.

        D.    Standards for Utilities.

        1.     All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from systems into floodwaters.

        2.     On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

        E.     Standards for Subdivisions and Other Proposed Development.

        1.     All preliminary subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall identify the special flood hazard areas and the base flood elevations.

        2.     All final subdivision plans will provide the elevation of the base flood including the elevations of proposed structure(s), pads, and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the city floodplain administrator, as-built information shall be submitted and certified by a registered professional civil engineer or land surveyor including lowest floor elevations, pad elevations, and lowest adjacent grade elevations and provided to the official as set forth in Section 15.32.040(C)(1).

        3.     All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

        4.     All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

        5.     All subdivision and other proposed proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage as set forth in Section 15.32.040(B)(3).

        F.     Standards for Manufactured Homes.

        1.     All manufactured homes that are placed, or substantially improved, on sites located: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, shall:

        a.     Within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city of Crescent City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.

        b.     Within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the city of Crescent City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, meet the requirements of Section 15.32.050(I); and

        2.     All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, AE, V1-30, V, and VE on the city of Crescent City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (F)(1) will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that the:

        a.     Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or

        b.     Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade.

        3.     Flood resistant materials are to be used, at a minimum at and below the base flood elevation (BFE).

        4.     Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the city building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the city floodplain administrator (director of community development).

        G.    Standards For Recreational Vehicles.

        1.     All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, AE, V1-30, V, and VE will either:

        a.     Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

        b.     Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

        c.     Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.32.040(A) Permit review of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.32.050(F).

        2.     Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the city of Crescent City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map will meet the requirements of Section 15.32.050(G) and (H).

        H.    Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard as delineated on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map, and established in Section 15.32.030 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

        1.     Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed development shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

        2.     If paragraph (1) of this subsection is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed developments shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

        I.      Coastal High Hazard Areas.

        1.     Coastal high hazard areas (Zone V, and VE) are located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.32.030. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from coastal and tidal inundation; therefore, the following provisions shall apply:

        a.     All new buildings, structures, and other development shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide.

        b.     The placement of manufactured homes shall be prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision. Physical expansion of existing mobile home parks or subdivisions for the purpose of placing additional mobile homes is prohibited.

        2.     Construction Methods Area.

        a.     Elevation. All new residential and non-residential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the lowest horizontal supporting member of the lowest floor, excluding pilings or columns is elevated to or above the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest horizontal supporting member open and free of obstructions so as not to impede the flow of water, except for breakaway walls as provided for in paragraph (e)(ii) of this subsection.

        b.     Structural Support.

        i.      Pilings or columns used as structural support shall be designed and anchored so as to withstand all impact forces, lateral movement, and buoyancy factors of the base flood.

        ii.     There shall be no fill used for structural support of buildings.

        c.     Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

        d.     Certification. Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall be certified to by a registered professional engineer or architect and provided to the director of community development.

        e.     Space below the lowest horizontal support member:

        i.      Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or substantial improvement to a structure started after the enactment of the chapter codified in this chapter shall not enclose the space below the lowest horizontal support member unless breakaway walls are used as provided for in this section.

        ii.     Breakaway walls may be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not a part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway under abnormally high tides or wave action.

        iii.    All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest horizontal support member free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Section 15.32.020 of this chapter. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, will not be a basement as defined in Section 15.32.020, and may only be used solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

        iv.    For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: (A) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and (B) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards.

        v.     Prior to construction, plans for any structure that will have breakaway walls must be submitted to the director of community development for approval. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018; Ord. 682 § 5, 1999; Ord. 625, 1988; Ord. 610, 1986)

 

15.32.060 Variance procedures.
        A.    The planning commission as established by the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

        B.     The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the director of community development of this chapter.

        C.     Those aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the city council.

        D.    Conditions for Variances. Variances may be issued when necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. Variances issued for economic considerations, aesthetics, or because variances have been used in the past, are not good and sufficient cause. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018; Ord. 625, 1988; Ord. 610, 1986)

 

15.32.070 Nature of variances.
        A.    The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

        B.     The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

        C.     It is the duty of the planning commission to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance (chapter) are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018)

 

15.32.080 Conditions for variances.
        A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.32.040 and 15.32.050 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

        B.     Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Section 15.32.020 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

        C.     Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

        D.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter.

        E.     Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

        1.     The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and

        2.     Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Del Norte County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

        F.     The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018)

 

15.32.090 Criteria for variances.
        A.    In passing upon requests for variances, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

        1.     Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

        2.     Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

        3.     Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

        4.     Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

        5.     Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

        6.     Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

        7.     Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

        8.     Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

        9.     Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

        10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

        11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

        B.     Variances shall only be issued upon a:

        1.     Showing of good and sufficient cause;

        2.     Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and

        3.     Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, or create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause “Fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.

        C.     Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Section 15.32.080(A) through (D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

        D.    Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.32.090(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 802-U § 3, 2018)

The subdivider shall file as many copies of the tentative map as may be required by the city engineer. (Ord. 587, 1983; Ord. 579, 1982; prior code § 29-401 (1))

 

16.16.020 Preliminary soils report.
        A.    A preliminary soils report, prepared by a civil engineer registered in this state and based upon adequate testing borings shall be submitted to the city engineer with the filing of a tentative map or parcel map for every subdivision.

        B.     In the case of subdivision of less than five parcels, the requirement for a preliminary soils report may be waived by the city engineer provided the city engineer finds that due to the knowledge the city has as to the soils qualities of the soils in the subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary.

        C.     If the city has knowledge of, or the preliminary soils report indicates, the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soils investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required by the city engineer. Such soils investigation shall be done by a civil engineer registered in this state, who shall recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where such soils problem exists.

        D.    The planning commission may approve the subdivision or portion thereof where such soils problems exist if it determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed, and a condition to the issuance of any building permit may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure. (Prior code § 29-401 (2))

 

16.16.030 Restrictive covenants.
        A preliminary copy of any restrictive covenants proposed shall be filed with the tentative map. (Prior code § 29-401 (3))

Chapter 17.31 NR NATURAL RESOURCES DISTRICT
17.31.010 Purpose and application.
        The purpose of the natural resources district is to protect those non-coastal areas in the city that have been identified as sensitive riparian or wetland habitat and to provide for a buffer zone to protect the wetlands. The uses of natural resource areas are limited to those in accordance with the policies of the natural resources/conservation and land use elements of the general plan. Further, the procedures in order to specify the boundaries of any riparian or wetland habitat and incentives to direct development away from such areas are provided by this district. (Ord. 700 (Exh. A), 2003)

 

17.31.020 Uses.
        A.    The principal permitted use in the natural resource district is resource dependent activity which includes:

        1.     Fish and wildlife management such as nature study and fishing, which may include the development of minor facilities constructed or placed by hand such as blinds, lookouts, interpretive panels, fences and foot-trails.

        2.     Maintenance and repair of existing public facilities such as: flood-control and drainage channels, roads or road crossings, and utilities.

        3.     Removal of windblown trees which threaten existing structures.

        B.     Other NR uses for which a use permit must first be secured:

        1.     In all areas, those recreational facilities included in a publicly adopted state park and recreation or department of fish and game master plan.

        2.     In all areas, wetland or stream restoration programs.

        3.     In riparian areas and wetland buffer areas, recreational trails.

        4.     In riparian areas, new roads where crossings shall be limited, when feasible, to right angle crossing of streams and stream corridors.

        5.     In all areas, one single-family residence and appurtenant structure when denial of such would otherwise substantially deny all reasonable use of the parcel, including use of incentive density, and where such development will be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade the environmentally sensitive habitat area. Height limits shall be as in the R-l district. (Ord. 700 (Exh. A), 2003)

 

17.31.030 General provisions.
        A.    The general plan land use map identifies the locations of environmentally sensitive natural resource areas (wetlands and riparian habitat areas). Where question or dispute arises over the location of a habitat boundary the applicant shall provide the following information:

        1.     A base map delineating topographic lines, adjacent roads, location of dikes, levees, flood control channels, and tide gates;

        2.     A soils map;

        3.     A vegetation map; and

        4.     A biologists report.

        The definitions of wetlands and riparian vegetation within the general plan and consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shall be utilized for determinations.

        C.     Wetland Buffer. Where a wetland is not within a designated riparian vegetation corridor, a buffer area of one hundred feet shall be maintained, to be measured landward of the wetland edge. A buffer of less than one hundred feet may be utilized where it can be determined that there is no adverse impact on the wetland. A determination to utilize a buffer are of less than one hundred feet shall be made in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game. The city’s determination shall be based upon specific findings as to the adequacy of the proposed buffer to protect the identified resource. The required rear, front and side yard setbacks of a parcel may be located within the buffer area; however, no development other than that specified above may take place within that portion of the yard setbacks located within the buffer area.

        D.    Riparian Vegetation Corridor. Native vegetation along any river, stream or creek shall be maintained from top of highest bank to top of highest bank to provide bank stabilization, water quality and wildlife habitat. Additional setback from top of highest bank may be required for geologic or flooding safety. Within this top of bank/safety area eighty percent of the native vegetation canopy shall be retained. Native trees which canopy the watercourse shall be retained unless an existing structure is immediately threatened or a permitted use activity is approved. Where such a new permitted activity occurs native riparian vegetation shall be replaced and maintained on-site, in kind with native species. Where non-native vegetation is removed it shall be replaced and maintained on-site, in-kind with native species.

        E.     Any dredging and/or spoils disposal undertaken as part of the maintenance and repair of existing public facilities (such as flood-control and drainage channels, roads or road crossings or utilities) shall be planned and carried out to avoid significant disruption to marine and wildlife habitats and water circulation. (Ord. 700 (Exh. A), 2003)

 

17.31.040 Conservation incentive density bonus.
        Where the property owner chooses, they may offer to the city or another public agency an easement, the ownership or another acceptable method of open space dedication for that portion of their property designated as NR natural resources. In such cases the city shall provide the property owner with a development agreement which provides for residential development density credit, above that permitted by the general plan, on the immediately adjacent non-NR area of the subject parcel. This provision shall be subject to meeting all of the following criteria:

        A.    The offered lands within the natural resources zone district shall be substantially in a natural undisturbed state;

        B.     The offer for dedication and development agreement shall be negotiated with the city and approved by the city council prior to recordation of the dedication. The development agreement shall be recorded at the same time as the dedication;

        C.     The residential density bonus shall be calculated based only on the geometric area zoned NR which is to be dedicated;

        D.    The density bonus granted shall not exceed one-third of the density which would be permitted if the natural resources zone were designated the same land use as the adjacent area. Where the adjacent area is designated for residential use its density shall be used. If the adjacent area is designated for commercial use, up to twelve or fifteen units per acre shall be used, as specified for the commercial area density by the general plan. Where two designations are adjacent the lower density shall be used as typical; however the additional units may be located in either area; and

        E.     The development agreement bonus units shall be located only on immediately adjacent lands owned by the same property owner which are not in the resource conservation area. The units may not be applied to lands not adjacent nor to lands owned by another party. However, provision may be made in the development agreement permitting the right to the additional units to transfer with property title if the owner wished to sell at a later date. (Ord. 700 (Exh. A), 2003)

Chapter 17.39 SIGNS
Note
*       Chapter 17.39 applies to all signs erected in the city as of January 17, 1996, and for all signs erected in the coastal zone as of January 17, 1996, pending Coastal Commission approval. Chapter 17.39 shall not apply to legal nonconforming signs as defined in Section 17.39.030, except as provided in Section 17.39.020.

 

17.39.010 Purpose.
        A.    The surroundings of the city are possessed of natural beauty having both giant redwoods and the Pacific Ocean at the disposal of its citizens. The city’s economy is dependent on a vigorous local business economy, spawned in part by tourism and its residential environment. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs in the city. Signs have an obvious impact on the character, quality and economic health of the city. As a prominent part of the scenery, signs may attract the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and help set the tone of the community.

        B.     It is the intent of the city that this chapter emphasize the importance of business activity to the economic vitality of the city, help improve the ability of business owners and operators to identify their businesses to the community to enhance the furtherance of commerce, foster varied and interesting places of trade and promote public safety by making business signing visible to the passing public. This chapter is further intended to encourage the use of signs that:

        1.     Protect and enhance the architectural character, harmony and natural beauty of the community, its buildings and its various neighborhoods and districts;

        2.     Protect commercial districts from sign clutter;

        3.     Protect the public’s ability to identify users and premises without confusion;

        4.     Eliminate unnecessary distractions which may jeopardize pedestrian or vehicular traffic safety;

        5.     Are as small in size and few in number as is consistent with their purpose of communicating identification and essential information;

        6.     Protect the right of the public to be directed, warned, advised and informed;

        7.     Possess a satisfactory aesthetic effect and pleasing elements of design that relates to the form, proportion, material, surface treatment and position;

        8.     Assure the maintenance of signs;

        9.     Implement the community design objectives expressed in the general plan;

        10.   Prohibit political signs on public utility or street sign poles because it is necessary to prevent visual distractions to motorists that create traffic hazards, prevent the obstruction of road hazards and road signs, and to prevent eyesores from proliferating along public streets;

        11.   Regulate the size of political signs because it is necessary for safety and aesthetic reasons, specifically that the strong winds common in the city would remove the signs, creating hazards and accumulation of debris, and extremely large or illuminated signs would create a distraction to motorists.

        C.     The general sign usage provisions and regulations of this chapter shall apply. The additional sign usage authorized hereunder shall be strictly construed in its application. (Ord. 672 § 5)

        6.     Any on-premises advertising display for which there has been an agreement between the sign permit holder and the city for its removal as of any given date;

        7.     Any on-premises advertising display which is a temporary sign;

        8.     Any on-premises advertising display which is or may become a danger to the public or is unsafe;

        9.     Any on-premises advertising display which constitutes a traffic hazard not created by relocation of streets or highways or by acts of any city or county;

        F.     Monument or Ground Signs. Monument or ground signs shall not exceed five or ten feet in height, depending upon the regulations for the zone in which the sign is being placed, unless a variance for a higher sign has first been approved by the planning commission.

Any permit, certificate or license issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall be void.

        2.     The community development director, public works director, building official, code enforcement officer, or other person authorized by the city manager, shall be authorized to enforce provisions of this chapter and to issue citations and make arrests pursuant to state and city codes.

        a.     The community development director or designee shall be responsible for the following functions:

        i.      Interpretations of this chapter; and

        ii.     The review of sign permit applications for conformance with this chapter.

        b.     The building official or designee shall be responsible for the following functions:

        i.      Inspections of signs and installation of signs;

        B.     Right of Entry. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this code, or whenever the community development director, enforcement officer or their designee has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition which makes such building or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous or may otherwise be in violation of the code, the community development director, enforcement officer or their designee may enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed by this code.

        C.     Violations. Any sign or sign structure erected, constructed, altered, enlarged, converted, moved or maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter and any use of land, building or premises established, conducted, operated or maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be and is declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. All necessary legal proceedings for the abatement, removal and enjoinment thereof may be instituted in the manner provided by law and other steps as may be necessary to accomplish these ends may be utilized to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to grant such relief as will remove and abate the structure or use and restrain and enjoin the person, firm, corporation or an organization from erecting, moving, altering or enlarging the structure or using the site contrary to the provisions of this chapter. The remedies prescribed by this section are cumulative and not exclusive.

        D.    Procedure.

        1.     The city manager, community development director, building official, city attorney or their designee may serve notice requiring the removal of any structure or use in violation of this chapter on the owner or the owner’s authorized agent, on a tenant or on an architect, builder, contractor or other person who commits or participates in any violation.

        2.     In the event of a violation of this chapter or any regulation made under authority conferred herein, in addition to other remedies, the city attorney may institute any appropriate criminal prosecution, civil action or other proceedings to punish the perpetrator of such violation; to prevent such unlawful erection, movement, alteration, enlargement, maintenance or use; to restrain, enjoin, connect or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.

        E.     Stop Work Orders. Whenever any sign work is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the city manager, community development director, building official, city attorney or their designee may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in doing such work or in causing such work to be done. Any such persons shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the city to proceed with the work.

        F.     Revocation of Permit. Any permit issued under the terms of this chapter may be revoked by the community development director, public works director or building official when it appears that the sign has been erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any other ordinance or law. No such permit revocation shall be effective until the planning commission affirms the revocation after a hearing set for that purpose. Written notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given to the permit holder at least ten days before the date set for the hearing. The notice shall contain a brief statement of the grounds for revoking the permit. Notice may be given either by personal delivery or by deposit in the United States mail a sealed envelope, registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed to the permit holder.

        G.    Owner to Remove Signs. Within thirty days after the revocation of any permit as provided in subsection F of this section, or within ten days after affirmance of such revocation the sign or signs described in such revocation shall be removed by the former permit holder. If such removal is not completed within that time, the community development department shall cause such sign to be removed, and permit holder shall be liable to city for all costs reasonably associated with the sign removal including, but not limited to, all fees, salaries (including benefits) and disposal charges.

        H.    Nature of Removal.

        1.     A sign subject to removal shall be removed in a safe manner.

        2.     Any accessory structures or foundations or mounting materials that are unsightly or a danger to the safety and welfare of the citizens shall be removed along with the sign.

        I.      Removal—Assessment of Costs. The costs involved in the removal of signs by the city shall become a special assessment against the real property upon which the sign is located. The community development department shall notify, in writing, all persons having an interest of record in the official records of the county assessor of the amount of such assessment resulting from such work. Within five days of the service of such notice, any person having any right, title or interest in the property or any part thereof, may file with the planning commission a written request for a hearing on the correctness and/or reasonableness of such assessment. In the event of such timely written request, the planning commission shall set the matter for hearing, give such person reasonable notice thereof by first class mail, postage prepaid, hold such hearing, and determine the reasonableness and/or correctness of the assessment. The planning commission shall notify, by first class mail, postage prepaid, all such persons making such request of its decision in writing within five days thereof. If the total assessment determined as provided for in this section is not paid in full within ten days after receipt of such notice, the community development department shall record in the office of the county recorder a statement of the total balance still due and a legal description of the property. From the date of such recording, such balance due shall be a special assessment against the property.

        J.      Collection of Assessments. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.

        K.    Violation—Penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor or an infraction as charged per the prosecutorial discretion of the city attorney. Such person, firm or corporation shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each day during any portion of which any violation of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm or corporation.

        L.     Nuisance Abatement. The city council determines that the public peace, safety, morals, health and welfare require that all signs and advertising structures heretofore constructed or erected in violation of any ordinance of the city in effect at the time such sign was constructed or erected be and are hereby made subject to the same provisions of this section. Such signs shall be made to conform and comply with this chapter as soon as reasonably possible after January 17, 1996. All signs and advertising structures that are not made to conform and comply within a reasonable time shall be and are declared to be public nuisances and may be abated in the manner provided. All signs and advertising structures which are structurally unsafe, which constitute a fire hazard or which are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which constitute any hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster, damage or abandonment, as specified in this chapter or any other effective ordinance, are, for the purposes of this section, unsafe signs or sign structures. All such unsafe signs or sign structures are declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal. (Ord. 672 § 5)

Chapter 17.40 FENCES
17.40.010 Generally.
        Fences are permissible for all residential districts under conditions and restrictions as stated in this chapter and require a fence permit. Fence permit fees shall be based on the current Uniform Administrative Code building permit fee schedule. Fences are mandatory for specific uses and shall be erected as required. For those uses already existing which do not have the required fencing, they shall be considered nonconforming and may continue in operation for an indefinite period of time as prescribed by the section on nonconforming uses. When such uses are proposed for remodeling, enlargement or extension of use, then they shall be required to conform to this section. For the purposes of definitions, “fence” means a structure made of wire, wood, metal, masonry or other materials, and includes a hedge which is further defined as a barrier formed by branches, shrubs or small trees growing close together in a line with interwoven branches. (Ord. 629 Exh. A, 1988; prior code § 30-800)

 

17.40.020 In residential districts.
        Regulations for fences in residential districts shall include the following:

        A.    Front yards, maximum height above grade not to exceed thirty-sixty inches except that the fence may be erected to a maximum height of forty-eight inches; provided, that any fence which exceeds thirty-six inches is uniformly open to the extent of thirty-three and one-third percent. “Uniformly open” means that the interstices between the solid material of the fence are evenly spaced so as to make vision through the fence possible;

        B.     Rear yards, maximum height six feet above grade;

        C.     Side yards, maximum height six feet above grade;

        D.    On a corner lot in any residential district, no fence shall be erected or plants permitted to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision between the height of three and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the lot lines of such corner lots in a line joining points along such lot lines thirty-five feet from the point of intersection. (Ord. 629 Exh. A, 1988; prior code § 30-800.1)

 

17.40.030 Exceptions—Corner and key lots.
        A.    Corner Lots. On corner lots, for a distance of twenty feet from the side street curb, no fence or hedge shall exceed a maximum height above grade of thirty-six inches except that the fence may be erected to a maximum height of forty-eight inches; provided, that any fence which exceeds thirty-six inches is uniformly open to the extent of thirty-three and one-third percent. “Uniformly open” means that the interstices between the solid material of the fence are evenly spaced so as to make vision through the fence possible.

        B.     Key Lots. In the front yard of a key lot on the side which abuts the rear yard of a reversed corner lot, a fence may be erected or a hedge permitted to grow to a maximum height of six feet upon a point twenty feet from the curb.

        C.     Street Right-of-Way Encroachment Permits. Fences may be built within the street right-of-way if a street right-of-way encroachment permit is obtained from the director of public works.

        This would allow fences to be built up to the sidewalk line, or five feet from the curb where there is no sidewalk. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.40.040 Parking lots or nonresidential development.
        A.    Parking Lots. A solid fence of six feet shall be maintained on the rear and side lot lines where said parking lot abuts or rears on property which is used or zoned for residential purposes and said parking lot is in an ownership separate from the adjacent properties. Fencing or screening for the street side property lines shall be in accordance with the development standards for parking lots under Section 17.42.120.

        B.     Nonresidential Development. The development of any property of a nonresidential nature shall include a minimum six-foot solid fence along the rear and side property lines when such property abuts or rears on property zoned or used for residential purposes. (Ord. 629 Exh. A, 1988; prior code § 30-800.3)

 

17.40.050 General provisions.
        A.    No electricity charged fences shall be permitted in the city.

        B.     No barbed wire or other sharp pointed material shall be used in the construction of a fence unless said material is over six feet above grade.

        C.     Fences which enclosed school grounds, public playgrounds, tennis courts, public swimming pools or other public areas which are used for athletic purposes may be erected to a height in excess of six feet.

        D.    Corner lots must maintain the present requirements for visibility at intersections. (See subsection G of Section 17.08.080). (Ord. 629 Exh. A, 1988; prior code § 30-800.4)

 

17.40.060 Appeal.
        Any person aggrieved by the provisions of this chapter may appeal to the planning commission for a variance. The procedure for said variance shall be described in Chapter 17.56. (Ord. 629 Exh. A, 1988; prior code § 30-800.5)

Chapter 17.41 LANDSCAPING
17.41.010 Water efficient landscaping.
        A.    Purpose.

        1.     The state legislature has found:

        (a)    That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;

        (b)    That the continuation of California’s economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;

        (c)    That it is the policy of the State to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;

        (d)    That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development; and

        (e)    That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient; and

        (f)    That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.

        2.     Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this chapter is to:

        (a)    Promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and other resources as efficiently as possible;

        (b)    Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects;

        (c)    Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes;

        (d)    Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;

        (e)    Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies;

        (f)    Encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and

        (g)    Encourage cooperation between the City of Crescent City and other local agencies to implement and enforce the provisions of the water efficient landscape ordinance.

             State law reference—Authority cited: Section 65593, Government Code. Reference: Sections 65591, 65593, 65596, Government Code.

        (b)    New construction and rehabilitated landscapes which are developer-installed in single-family and multifamily projects with a landscape area equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check, or design review;

        (c)    New construction landscapes which are homeowner-provided and/or homeowner-hired in single-family and multifamily residential projects with a total project landscape area equal to or greater than five thousand square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check or design review;

        (d)    Existing landscapes limited to Sections 17.41.10(V), 17.41.10(W) and 17.41.10(X); and

        H.    Water Efficient Landscape Worksheet.

        1.     A project applicant shall complete the water efficient landscape worksheet which contains two sections (see sample worksheet in Appendix B):

        (a)    A hydrozone information table (see Appendix B, Section A) for the landscape project; and

        (b)    A water budget calculation (see Appendix B, Section B) for the landscape project. For the calculation of the maximum applied water allowance and estimated total water use, a project applicant shall use the ETo values from the reference evapotranspiration table in Appendix A. For geographic areas not covered in Appendix A, use data from other cities located nearby in the same reference evapotranspiration zone, as found in the CIMIS Reference Evapotranspiration Zones Map, Department of Water Resources, 1999.

        2.     Water budget calculations shall adhere to the following requirements:

        (a)    The plant factor used shall be from WUCOLS. The plant factor ranges from 0 to 0.3 for low water use plants, from 0.4 to 0.6 for moderate water use plants, and from 0.7 to 1.0 for high water use plants.

        (b)    All water features shall be included in the high water use hydrozone and temporarily irrigated areas shall be included in the low water use hydrozone.

        (c)    All special landscape areas shall be identified and their water use calculated as described below.

        (d)    ETAF for special landscape areas shall not exceed 1.0.

        3.     Maximum applied water allowance.

        (a)    The maximum applied water allowance shall be calculated using the equation:

 

MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 × LA) + (0.3 × SLA)]

 

        The example calculations below are hypothetical to demonstrate proper use of the equations and do not represent an existing and/or planned landscape project. The ETo values used in these calculations are from the reference evapotranspiration table in Appendix A, for planning purposes only. For actual irrigation scheduling, automatic irrigation controllers are required and shall use current reference evapotranspiration data, such as from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), other equivalent data, or soil moisture sensor data.

        (i)     Example MAWA calculation: a hypothetical landscape project in Fresno, CA with an irrigated landscape area of fifty thousand square feet without any Special Landscape Area (SLA = 0, no edible plants, recreational areas, or use of recycled water). To calculate MAWA, the annual reference evapotranspiration value for Fresno is 51.1 inches as listed in the reference evapotranspiration table in Appendix A.

MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 × LA) + (0.3 × SLA)]

MAWA = Maximum applied water allowance (gallons per year)

ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (inches per year)

0.62 = Conversion factor (to gallons)

0.7 = ET adjustment factor (ETAF)

LA = Landscape area including SLA (square feet)

0.3 = Additional water allowance for SLA

SLA = Special landscape area (square feet)

MAWA = (51.1 inches) (0.62) [(0.7 × 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 × 0)] = 1,108,870 gallons per year

        To convert from gallons per year to hundred-cubic-feet per year:

= 1,108,870/748 = 1,482 hundred-cubic-feet per year (100 cubic feet = 748 gallons)

        (ii)    In this next hypothetical example, the landscape project in Fresno, CA has the same ETo value of 51.1 inches and a total landscape area of fifty thousand square feet. Within the fifty thousand square foot project, there is now a two thousand square foot area planted with edible plants. This two thousand square foot area is considered to be a special landscape area.

MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.7 × LA) + (0.3 × SLA)]

MAWA = (51.1 inches) (0.62) [(0.7 × 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 × 2,000 square feet)]

= 31.68 × [35,000 + 600] gallons per year

= 31.68 × 35,600 gallons per year

= 1,127,808 gallons per year or 1,508 hundred-cubic-feet per year

        4.     Estimated total water use.

        (a)    The estimated total water use shall be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the estimated total water use calculated for all hydrozones shall not exceed MAWA.

ETWU = (ETo)(0.62)(PF x HA / IE + SLA)

Where:

ETWU = Estimated total water use per year (gallons)

ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (inches)

PF = Plant factor from WUCOLS (see Section 491)

HA = Hydrozone area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square feet)

SLA = Special landscape area (square feet)

0.62 = Conversion factor

IE = Irrigation efficiency (minimum 0.71)

        (i)     Example ETWU calculation: Landscape area is fifty thousand square feet; plant water use type, plant factor, and hydrozone area are shown in the table below. The ETo value is 51.1 inches per year. There are no special landscape areas (recreational area, area permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants, and area irrigated with recycled water) in this example.

= 1,102,116 gallons per year

        Compare ETWU with MAWA: For this example MAWA = (51.1) (0.62) [(0.7 × 50,000) + (0.3 × 0)] = 1,108,870 gallons per year. The ETWU (1,102,116 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,108,870 gallons per year). In this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA.

        (ii)    Example ETWU calculation: total landscape area is fifty thousand square feet, two thousand square feet of which is planted with edible plants. The edible plant area is considered a special landscape area (SLA). The reference evapotranspiration value is 51.1 inches per year.

= (31.68) (33,099 + 2,000)

= 1,111,936 gallons per year

        Compare ETWU with MAWA. For this example: MAWA = (51.1) (0.62) [(0.7 × 50,000) + (0.3 × 2,000)]

= 31.68 × [35,000 + 600]

= 31.68 × 35,600

        The ETWU (1,111,936 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,127,808 gallons per year). For this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA.

        (a)    Plant Material.

        (i)     Any plant may be selected for the landscape, providing the estimated total water use in the landscape area does not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. To encourage the efficient use of water, the following is highly recommended:

        1.     Protection and preservation of native species and natural vegetation;

        2.     Selection of water-conserving plant and turf species;

        3.     Selection of plants based on disease and pest resistance;

        4.     Selection of trees based on applicable tree ordinances or tree shading guidelines; and

        5.     Selection of plants from approved plant lists.

        (ii)    Each hydrozone shall have plant materials with similar water use, with the exception of hydrozones with plants of mixed water use, as specified in Section 17.41.10(K)(1)(b)(iv).

        (iii)   Plants shall be selected and planted appropriately based upon their adaptability to the climatic, geologic, and topographical conditions of the project site. To encourage the efficient use of water, the following is highly recommended:

        1.     Use the Sunset Western Climate Zone System which takes into account temperature, humidity, elevation, terrain, latitude, and varying degrees of continental and marine influence on local climate;

        2.     Recognize the horticultural attributes of plants (i.e., mature plant size, invasive surface roots) to minimize damage to property or infrastructure [e.g., buildings, sidewalks, power lines]; and

        3.     Consider the solar orientation for plant placement to maximize summer shade and winter solar gain.

        (iv)   Turf is not allowed on slopes greater than twenty-five percent where the toe of the slope is adjacent to an impermeable hardscape and where twenty-five percent means one foot of vertical elevation change for every four feet of horizontal length (rise divided by run × 100 = slope percent).

        (v)    A landscape design plan for projects in fire-prone areas shall address fire safety and prevention. A defensible space or zone around a building or structure is required per Public Resources Code Section 4291(a) and (b). Avoid fire-prone plant materials and highly flammable mulches.

        (vi)   The use of invasive and/or noxious plant species is strongly discouraged.

        (vii)  The architectural guidelines of a common interest development, which include community apartment projects, condominiums, planned developments, and stock cooperatives, shall not prohibit or include conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of low-water use plants as a group.

        (b)    Water Features.

        (i)     Recirculating water systems shall be used for water features.

        (ii)    Where available, recycled water shall be used as a source for decorative water features.

        (iii)   Surface area of a water feature shall be included in the high water use hydrozone area of the water budget calculation.

        (iv)   Pool and spa covers are highly recommended.

        (c)    Mulch and Amendments.

        (i)     A minimum two-inch layer of mulch shall be applied on all exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is contraindicated.

        (ii)    Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes.

        (iii)   The mulching portion of the seed/mulch slurry in hydro-seeded applications shall meet the mulching requirement.

        (iv)   Soil amendments shall be incorporated according to recommendations of the soil report and what is appropriate for the plants selected (see Section 17.41.10(I))

        2.     The landscape design plan, at a minimum, shall:

        (a)    Delineate and label each hydrozone by number, letter, or other method;

        (b)    Identify each hydrozone as low, moderate, high water, or mixed water use. Temporarily irrigated areas of the landscape shall be included in the low water use hydrozone for the water budget calculation;

        (c)    Identify recreational areas;

        (d)    Identify areas permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants;

        (e)    Identify areas irrigated with recycled water;

        (f)    Identify type of mulch and application depth;

        (g)    Identify soil amendments, type, and quantity;

        (h)    Identify type and surface area of water features;

        (i)     Identify hardscapes (pervious and non-pervious);

        (j)     Identify location and installation details of any applicable stormwater best management practices that encourage on-site retention and infiltration of stormwater. Stormwater best management practices are encouraged in the landscape design plan and examples include, but are not limited to:

        (i)     Infiltration beds, swales, and basins that allow water to collect and soak into the ground;

        (ii)    Constructed wetlands and retention ponds that retain water, handle excess flow, and filter pollutants; and

        (iii)   Pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., permeable pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete, etc.) that minimize runoff.

        (k)    Identify any applicable rain harvesting or catchment technologies (e.g., rain gardens, cisterns, etc.);

        (l)     Contain the following statement: “I have complied with the criteria of the ordinance and applied them for the efficient use of water in the landscape design plan”; and

        (m)   Bear the signature of a licensed landscape architect, licensed landscape contractor, or any other person authorized to design a landscape.

The irrigation system and its related components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation package.

        (a)    System.

        (i)     Dedicated landscape water meters are highly recommended on landscape areas smaller than five thousand square feet to facilitate water management.

        (ii)    Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.

        (iii)   The irrigation system shall be designed to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the manufacturer’s recommended pressure range for optimal performance.

        1.     If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices such as inline pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.

        2.     Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be conducted at installation.

        (iv)   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing weather or during rain.

        (v)    Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair.

        (vi)   Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant shall refer the appropriate Municipal Code chapter for additional backflow prevention requirements.

        (vii)  High flow sensors that detect and report high flow conditions created by system damage or malfunction are recommended.

        (viii) The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures.

        (ix)   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation systems.

        (x)    The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the hydrozones of the landscape design plan.

        (xi)   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in Section 17.41.10(H) regarding the maximum applied water allowance.

        (xii)  It is highly recommended that the project applicant inquire with the City of Crescent City about peak water operating demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the effectiveness of the irrigation system.

        (xiii) In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.

        (xiv) Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s recommendations.

        (xv)  Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using the manufacturer’s recommendations.

        (xvi) Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to high traffic areas.

        (xvii)        Check valves or anti-drain valves are required for all irrigation systems.

        (xviii)       Narrow or irregularly shaped areas, including turf, less than eight feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface irrigation or low volume irrigation system.

        (xix) Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if:

        1.     The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or

        2.     The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or

        3.     The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in Section 17.41.10(K)(1)(a)(viii). Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.

        (xx)  Slopes greater than twenty-five percent shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with a precipitation rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.

        (b)    Hydrozone.

        (i)     Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.

        (ii)    Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.

        (iii)   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from shrubs, groundcovers, and turf.

        (iv)   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:

        1.     Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or

        2.     The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for calculations.

        (v)    Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants shall not be permitted.

        (vi)   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan, hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hydrozone Information Table (see Appendix B Section A). This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and programming the controller.

        2.     The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:

        (a)    Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;

Chapter 17.46 SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
17.46.010 Purposes and application.
        A.    The purposes of a site plan and architectural review are to permit the city to evaluate site plans and designs of structures to assure compatibility, harmony in appearance in neighborhoods, reduce negative impacts on adjacent properties, reduce the unnecessary destruction of the environment and ground cover to avoid the creation of hazardous conditions and drainage problems, to avoid monotonous and otherwise nonaesthetic development injurious to the overall community; to provide a vehicle to encourage full development of streets servicing the properties, and to assure full installation of all public utilities necessary to serve such properties.

        B.     Site plan review and architectural review provisions of this title shall apply to all permitted uses in the R-3, R-P, C-1, C-2, CM, CW, M, and the HS districts and shall be required of all uses subject to use permit. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.46.020 Architectural review committee.
        A.    The architectural review committee shall consist of the five-member planning commission, the city planner and the city engineer. The architectural review committee may also invite individuals of known expertise to make comments and recommendations on site plans and architectural renderings submitted for architectural review.

        B.     A quorum shall consist of any four members.

        C.     The architectural review committee may convene at any meeting of the planning commission or may schedule special meetings to streamline project review.

        D.    No member shall participate in the discussions or determination on any project in which the member has a business or professional interest, or if the member resides within three hundred feet of the nearest project property line.

        E.     The architectural review committee will stand as established, and from time to time as conditions warrant, the planning commission may make such changes within such personnel as it deems fit. (Ord. 722 § 2, 2007; Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.46.030 Procedures.
        A.    The applicant shall submit an application on a form provided by the planning director, together with seven copies of such site plans or elevations of buildings on which a review committee report is required. The site plan shall be drawn to a scale which shall equally indicate the full dimensions and information necessary for the committee to make an evaluation of the request. Architectural drawings shall be of such scale and contain such information to permit the committee to make a full evaluation of the outside appearance, color, texture of materials, and appurtenances necessary for the development of the structure.

        B.     Scale drawings of all signs that will be included within the subject property shall also be submitted concurrently with the site plan and architectural plans of any proposed project. The review committee may require additional information, if necessary, to carry out the purposes of this chapter and/or may authorize the omission of any or all drawings required by this section if they are not necessary. (Ord. 722 § 2, 2007; Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.46.035 Review standards.
        A.    The architectural review committee shall review the application as to consistency with the applicable zoning, parking and landscaping, fencing, signage, street, sidewalk and public services requirements as set forth by this code.

        B.     Where the city council has adopted a development plan and/or development standards for a specifically defined neighborhood within the city, the application shall also be reviewed for consistency with the criteria of such plan or standards.

        C.     Where a structure(s) forty-five years or older is proposed for remodel or demolition, a review of the potential for impact upon a site listed on the National Historical Register or a site of local historical significance shall be made and considered in the architectural review decision. It is the goal of the city general plan to encourage property owners and other land managers to preserve or rehabilitate important historical and cultural sites rather than destroying them.

        D.    If a project requires a variance or use permit, the architectural review committee shall not issue final approval of the project until the planning commission or city council has taken final action on the variance or use permit. (Ord. 722 § 2, 2007; Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.46.040 Review, referral and action.
        A.    Within forty-five days after the submittal of a complete packet of drawings and applications for review, the committee shall conduct a public hearing and determine whether the project shall be denied, approved, or approved with conditions. Action by the committee shall be final unless the applicant appeals the action of the committee as set forth in this chapter.

        B.     Except as time requires to meet Section 17.46.035, if no action is taken by the committee sixty days after receipt of all drawings and applications it shall be deemed accepted and building permits may then be issued, which are in compliance with the drawings submitted for review. If the committee requests modifications, the time periods established shall not be resumed until revisions to the drawings, as requested, are resubmitted for consideration.

        C.     Approved plans, together with such conditions, shall be signed by the planning director and shall be dated and mailed to the applicant. The planning commission secretary shall place one copy of the approved plans in the files of the planning commission. (Ord. 722 § 2, 2007; Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.46.050 Decision of architectural review committee—Appeals to the city council.
        A.    Within ten days following the date of a decision of the architectural review committee on any site plan or architectural review application, the decision may be appealed to the city council by the applicant or any other interested party. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the planning commission, and shall be filed with the planning commission secretary. The appeal shall state specifically where it is claimed that there was an error or abusive discretion by the committee and wherein its decision was not supported by evidence in the record.

        B.     Following the receipt of such an appeal application, the city council, at its next regular meeting, shall set a date of hearing at which time the applicant may make his presentation and shall at that time present the site drawings and structural renderings and all other data which was presented to the committee, together with his arguments on said appeal. Should the city council find favor with the appeal, the planning director shall sign the documents, and the planning commission secretary shall mail a copy to the applicant and file one copy in the planning commission records.

Chapter 17.48 SPECIAL ZONING USES
17.48.010 Senior second units.
        Where an R-1 designated parcel does not qualify for a second dwelling unit pursuant to Section 17.10.020, a use permit for a temporary second dwelling use with kitchen facilities within an existing residence, or as part of a structural addition to an existing residence, in a zone restricting residential use to a one-family unit, may be considered by the planning commission as a use permit for seniors in any legally existing single-family residence subject to all of the following:

        A.    The senior second dwelling unit use shall be used for the sole occupancy of one to two specifically named adult persons who are sixty-two years of age or over.

        B.     The total designated floor area for the second dwelling use shall not exceed thirty percent of the floor area of the entire structure, including any proposed addition. However, under no circumstances shall the floor area of the second unit exceed seven hundred square feet.

        C.     The habitable floor area of the second dwelling use shall maintain direct, internal access to the habitable floor area of the primary residence, and a direct exist outside. For purposes of this section, habitable floor areas shall include interior hallways.

        D.    Any structural additions or alterations shall comply with all building, zoning, health and fire code requirements.

        E.     Utilities for the second dwelling area (electricity, water, sewage disposal, etc.) shall be integrated into those of the primary residence.

        F.     When the specified occupant(s) of the senior second dwelling use no longer reside in the unit or no longer qualifies for the use permitted under these provisions, the kitchen facilities shall be removed, the area integrated into the primary unit, and the area no longer used for second dwelling purposes.

        G.    The use permit shall be subject to annual review and verification of compliance by the planning department or planning commission. A use permit renewal fee, in an amount determined by the city council, may be charged. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.48.020 Reasonable housing accommodation for persons with disabilities.
        It is the policy of the city to provide fair access to housing for persons with disabilities, including providing reasonable accommodation in the application of its zoning laws pursuant to federal and state law. This title provides for residential care facilities as setforth by California Health and Safety Codes within specified residential and commercial districts. Where a request for accommodation beyond these provisions is made the following shall apply:

        A.    Application for Accommodation. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by submittal of an application to the city planning department. Certain factors provide the factual information necessary to develop a balance between the city’s interest and the need for housing. Consideration of these factors will vary depending on whether the request is being made in a residential or commercial zoning district, and they can only include the physical impacts of the proposed use, not the type of residents. The factors to be considered for reasonable accommodation include the following:

        1.     Special needs created by the disability;

        2.     Potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested accommodation;

 

        3.     Potential impact of the request on surrounding uses;

        4.     Potential hazardous impact of surrounding environment upon the requested accommodation;

        5.     Physical attributes of the property and structures;

        6.     Alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit;

        7.     In the case of a determination involving a single family dwelling, whether the household would be considered a single family dwelling if it were not using special services which are required because of the disabilities of the residents;

        8.     Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and

        9.     Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program.

        B.     City Programs. The following have been identified as city programs which should be considered with respect to requests for reasonable accommodation:

        1.     Health and Safety. The city is charged with ensuring the health and safety standards which are embodied in the Housing Code, Fire Code, Building Codes (including plumbing, mechanical and electrical), and the National Flood Insurance Program. The following are minimum health and safety standards which are not subject to variance.

        a.     Occupancy Standards. The most current California Building Code and Model Building Code (as adopted by the state of California) which have been adopted by the city prescribe the maximum number of persons per sleeping area which shall be applied.

        b.     Exiting. The most current California Building Code and Model Building Code which have been adopted by the city prescribe exiting requirements.

        c.     FEMA - Flood Insurance Program. The city is subject to potential flood, coastal erosion and tsunami damage. A request is located within an area designated as zone A, B or V15 of the most current flood insurance rate map, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall be subject to the requirements of the city’s flood damage prevention ordinance (Chapter 15.32).

        d.     Building Permits. Building permits will be required for new construction and changes to existing structures as prescribed by the most recently adopted California Building Code, Uniform Building Code and Americans with Disabilities Act.

        2.     Residential Zoning District. The city recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing the livability of existing neighborhoods throughout the community. The city encourages a variety and mix of housing types to provide adequate choices for housing to all persons and recognizes the need to conserve the existing housing stock and preserve the environment and livability of existing residential neighborhoods. The city will therefore review requests with particular consideration given to the following issues:

        a.     Residential Character. If the accommodation is requested in a residential zoning district, then it is reasonable to require that the house retain a residential character. This means that its interior and exterior design should be consistent with the style of residential structures around it. In order to promote a cohesive living environment, homes should contain sufficient common areas for the number of residents: including, at a minimum, a kitchen, dining area and living room large enough to serve the residents, and, in the case of larger residences, congregating or recreational rooms and adequate bathrooms.

        b.     Parking. Recognizing that the parking demand for persons with disabilities is often less than for a similarly situated non-disabled household, the following factors should be considered in reviewing an accommodation request:

        i.      Nature of the disability, with respect to the ability to or likelihood to drive;

        ii.     Proximity to public transit;

 

        iii.    Number of non-driving persons; and

        iv.    Development of an alternate parking plan or resident transportation program.

        3.     In general, residential uses in one-family dwellings, which involve staff who also live at the premises, should meet the following guidelines:

        a.     One off-street parking space for the first six client beds;

        b.     One off-street parking space for every four client beds (or portion thereof) above the first six; and

        c.     One off-street parking space for each employee or staff member.

        C.     Notices and Hearings.

        1.     Within thirty days of the application, a notice of accommodation decision is to be issued by the planning director and mailed to the applicant, adjacent property owners and any party who has requested notice of such determinations in writing. Adjacent is defined as those properties which share property lines with the proposed location or are directly across the street from the property for which reasonable accommodation is being requested.

        2.     Within ten working days of the notice of accommodation decision being mailed, any person may make a written appeal of the director’s decision to the planning commission. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and remedy requested. If no request is received, then the decision of the director will be final.

        3.     If appeal is received a public hearing shall be scheduled at the next reasonable available planning commission meeting. The decision of the planning commission is final. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.48.030 Incentives for affordable housing.
        The city wishes to provide a balance in housing types for all households in the community. Pursuant to Section 65915 et. seq. of the California Government Code the city will consider developers proposals to provide housing for very low and low income households by the provision of a density bonus for housing developments when issues of providing such housing in an affordable manner arise. Such bonus shall be made subject to the following provisions:

        A.    Qualification. In order to quality for a density bonus, a project must be a low or very low income or senior citizen housing project developed in compliance with the Section 65915 et seq. For a low income project, at least twenty percent of the units shall be low income affordable, for very low income projects not less than ten percent shall be very low income affordable, and for senior citizen projects not less than fifty percent of the units shall be restricted to senior citizens.

        B.     Limitation. Density bonuses shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the maximum density permitted by the applicable general plan land use designation for the subject property. For example, where the maximum allowable density based upon a land use designation is twelve units per acre, the density bonus shall not exceed three units per acre, yielding a total allowable density, with the bonus, of fifteen units per acre. The final project unit total would then be calculated based upon the project property size.

        C.     Application. An application for a density bonus shall be made in conjunction with the other required applications for the development and shall be subject to the same procedures required by those applications.

        D.    Affordability Cost Analysis. The developer shall include in the application for density bonus a cost analysis of the proposed project, with and without density bonus, demonstrating the cost per dwelling unit and projecting sales and/or rental costs for residents. The city shall include in its review of the application a written finding as to the need for incentive or development standards waiver for the provision of affordable housing as set forth in Section 50052.2 of the Health and Safety Code. The city may deny the request if affordable housing can be provided without the requested incentives.

        E.     Maintenance of Affordable Units. In exchange for the density bonus, the developer shall guarantee the units will be maintained for very low and low income households for thirty years. The guarantee shall be in the form of a deed restriction or other legally binding and enforceable document acceptable to the city council. The document shall be recorded with the Del Norte county recorder prior to the issuance of a building permit. The applicant shall comply with Crescent City housing authority procedures for the physical maintenance of the units.

        F.     Development Standards.

        1.     All residential projects granted a density bonus shall conform to the development standards applicable, except those standards regulating density or as waived under Section 17.48.050(E)

        2.     Where a proposed project is to be phased in its construction the number bonus units shall either be proportionately allocated between the phases or provided in the last phase of construction.

        G.    Waiver of Development Standards. If the applicant can demonstrate that the increased density cannot physically be accommodated on the site then the following development standards shall be waived during site plan review to accommodate the increase density. The waiver in the standards shall follow the priority order hereby established and the applicant shall demonstrate that the increased density cannot be accommodated with each sequential waiver before the waiver of the next standard is allowed. Only one standard shall be waived unless it is shown that each individual standard waiver will not physically accommodate the proposed density. A complete site plan and floor plan shall be provided to demonstrate the physical noncompliance. Priority order for waiver is:

        1.     A higher percentage of compact parking;

        2.     Reduction in distance between buildings, subject to compliance with safety codes;

        3.     Reduction in rear yard setbacks;

        4.     One additional floor of building height above the zoning district standard;

        5.     Reduction in side yard setbacks;

        6.     Reduction in number of required parking spaces (but not less than one space per unit);

        7.     Reduction in front yard setbacks; and

        8.     Reduction in parking lot landscaping standards. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

        C.     “Nonconforming use of buildings” means the building conforms but the use of the building is not permitted.

        D.    “Nonconforming use of nonconforming buildings” means where neither the building nor the use conforms to these regulations.

        E.     “Nonconforming use of land” means where there are generally no buildings or structures involved, and the use of land is nonconforming. (Ord. 621B Exh. A, 1988; Ord. 581, 1982)

        D.    Damage or Destruction. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its market value, as determined on the last equalized assessment roll at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Where a legally non-conforming two-family or multiple dwelling use is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, it may be considered for restoration, reconstruction or rebuilding subject to the following criteria:

 

        1.     The dwelling may be reconstructed, restored or rebuilt up to its predamaged size and number of dwelling units, and its nonconforming use, if any, may be resumed.

        2.     The project shall be subject to issuance of a building permit within two years of the date of destruction and shall comply with those California Building Standards and any other local building standards authorized under the Health and Safety Code in effect at the time of restoration.

        4.     The project shall otherwise be constructed in compliance with city zoning ordinances so long as the predamage size and number of units is maintained. Reconstruction of such units in an area zoned as industrial shall be prohibited.

        E.     Signs. Identification signs and associated sign structures for buildings may remain unless the building is abandoned for more than six months, in which case any and all signs shall be removed.

When such discontinuance has occurred, the premises or structure shall only be used for the purposes allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.

        E.     Damage or Destruction. Where a structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its market value, as determined by the county assessor on the last equalized assessment roll, it shall not resume its nonconforming use but may be restored and used in conformity with the provisions of this title. Where a legally non-conforming two-family or multiple dwelling use is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, it may be considered for restoration, reconstruction or rebuilding subject to the following criteria:

17.50.060 Nonconforming use of land.
        The lawful use of land existing on May 1, 1973, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, may be continued. A conforming use of land which becomes nonconforming due to reclassification, change of ordinance, or annexation, may be continued for a period of twenty years from the date the use becomes nonconforming, except that a legally established non-conforming two-family and multiple dwelling use may be continued for a period of thirty years unless located within an area of industrial zoning. No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied when it became nonconforming. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

 

17.50.070 Nonconforming lots.
        A.    A nonconforming lot shall not be reduced in area or width.

        C.     A nonconforming lot to be used for residential purposes shall be subject to the density requirements of such zoning district in which it is located, except that a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a nonconforming lot located in any district in which a single-family dwelling is permitted.

        D.    If two or more lots or combination of lots or portion of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width or area, the land involved shall be considered to be a single building site for purposes of this section, and no portion of the building site shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes the degree of compliance with lot width and area requirements, nor shall any division of any building site be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirement stated in this title. (Ord. 621B Exh. A, 1988; Ord. 581, 1982)

 

17.50.080 Nonconforming use of buildings and open land as integrated use.
        Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, where a nonconforming use is composed of an integrated use of land and buildings operated as a single unit, enlargement or expansion of the existing buildings may be made, or a more intensive use of the land and building may be made to the extent permitted by the planning commission, following the required public hearings, notice of which shall be given as required for proposed rezonings of property. Such uses shall be considered as a single unit when the main structure or structures contain not less than one thousand square feet, and the use of open land abutting the structures is clearly evident as being an integral part of the operations. Expansion, enlargement or intensifications of use shall be confined to the property of the original nonconforming use, and the commission may impose such conditions or limitations as it may determine necessary to observe the spirit of this chapter and to protect the public safety and welfare. (Ord. 621B Exh. A, 1988; Ord. 581, 1982)

        Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 17.50.030, 17.50.040, 17.50.050 and 17.50.060, upon a written complaint filed with the director of public works by an aggrieved person alleging that a nonconforming use of land or structures has become a public nuisance through decline in appearance, or through emissions of noise, smoke or vibration, or through the conduct of its operations has become a persistent police or fire problem, the planning director may refer the matter to the planning commission and the planning commission may, after the required public hearing, order the removal of the nonconforming use. The planning commission may initiate such proceedings upon its own motion for any of the above-described causes. The procedure for notice, hearing and appeal shall be as set forth in Section 17.56.020. (Ord. 631 Exh. A, 1989; Ord. 621B Exh. A, 1988; Ord. 581, 1982)

Chapter 17.52 TEMPORARY USES

A permit for a temporary use shall not be required, however, within a district which specifically permits such uses on a permanent basis. Permits for temporary uses shall be issued by the planning commission or by the planning director, in accordance with policies established for such uses by the planning commission. Other provisions of this title relative to the issuance and granting of use permits shall be applicable to the issuance of permits for temporary uses under this section except for public notices and hearings. Temporary uses of private property shall include the following:

        A.    Temporary real estate offices;

        C.     Christmas tree sales;

        D.    Signs for subdivisions and model homes;

        E.     Parking for events at schools and colleges; and

        F.     Carnivals and bazaars for nonprofit or religious purposes. (Ord. 695 § 2, 2003)

Chapter 17.54 USE PERMITS
17.54.010 Purpose.
        A.    These provisions do not negate the specific uses designated for each zoning district, but rather serve as a supplemental guide providing added protection to existing zoning districts and at the same time encouraging orderly growth.

        B.     The purpose of issuing a use permit shall be:

        1.     To assure that the degree of compatibility made the purpose of this chapter shall be maintained with respect to the particular use on a particular site and consideration of other existing and potential uses within the general area in which such use is proposed to be located, and

        2.     To recognize and compensate for variations in degree of technological processes and equipment as related to the factors of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors and hazards;

        3.     To assure that such use will be placed on a site that is both suitable and adequate and that the use will have a minor effect on present and future traffic and that such use will not become a nuisance to the neighborhood and such use conforms with the general plan and makes provisions for adequate off-street parking and loading, as well as landscaping and screen planning, as well as other matters pertinent to the particular case. (Prior code § 30-500)

 

17.54.020 Conditional and revocable.
        All use permits are always revocable and may be made conditional or valid for a specific time period and shall be issued by the planning commission or by the affirmative vote of the city council upon appeal for any of the uses for which a use permit is required by the terms of this title. Use permits must be obtained for those uses designated as requiring use permits under this title whether use be in connection with new construction, additions or enlargements or extensions of use. (Prior code § 30-500.1)

 

17.54.030 Applications for permits.
        A.    Applications for a use permit or a special use permit or a temporary use permit shall be made to the planning director in writing on a form prescribed by the commission and shall be accompanied by plans, sketch plans and elevations of the building. Applications filed under this section shall be accompanied by such fees as shall from time to time be set or established by resolution of the city council. Every application for a use permit or special use permit or temporary use permit shall be signed by the owner of the property for which the permit is sought, or his agent. In the case of leased premises the owner of the underlying fee title or his agent shall sign the application.

        B.     Use permits and special use permits and temporary permits are not personal to the applicant. Permission granted under a use permit or a special use permit or a temporary use permit is an incident of ownership of the property for which it is granted. The owner of the property shall be responsible for compliance with the terms and conditions of issuance, if any, of a use permit or a special use permit or a temporary use permit.

        C.     Applications for use permits, special use permits or temporary use permits shall be either referred directly by the planning director to the planning commission for public hearing and decision or where such is the case, be considered by the planning director and processed by him, in which event he shall make his written determination and transmit a copy thereof to the applicant. (Ord. 631 Exh. A, 1989; prior code § 30-500.2)

 

17.54.040 Notice and hearing.
        Procedure for hearing the applicant’s request for a use permit and a special use permit shall be the same as that as required for a variance under Section 17.56.020 to Section 17.56.050. (Prior Code § 30-500.3)

 

17.54.050 Appeal of decision on temporary use permit.
        In such cases where the temporary use permit has been refused by the planning director, the applicant may, within ten days of receipt of such notice, file an appeal with the city planning commission. The planning commission shall, upon receipt of such an appeal, set a hearing pursuant to the section of public hearings as established under the variance provisions of Section 17.56.020. (Ord. 631 Exh. A, 1989; prior code § 30-500.4)

Chapter 17.56 VARIANCES
17.56.010 Purpose.
        When unreasonable and unnecessary hardships or results inconsistent with the general purpose of this title result through the strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions thereof, the planning commission of the city shall have authority as an administrative act subject to the provisions of this section, to grant upon such conditions as it may determine such variances from the provisions of this code as may be in harmony with its general purpose and intent so that the spirit of this code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The sole purpose of any variance shall be to prevent discrimination and undue hardship and no variance shall be granted which would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other property in the same vicinity and zone. Before any variance may be granted the planning commission or the city council on appeal, it shall be shown:

        A.    That there are exceptional and extraordinary circumstances of conditions applicable to the property involved;

        B.     That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone and denied to the property in question;

        C.     That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such vicinity and zone in which property is located;

        D.    The granting of such variances will not adversely affect the general plan for Crescent City;

        E.     That a public hearing wherein the applicant is heard and in which he substantiates all of the conditions cited above; and

        F.     That the planning commission is reviewing such requests and hearing the evidence finds that conditions of subsections A through E of this section have been met. (Prior code § 30-502)

 

17.56.020 Application—Notice and hearing.
        Upon the filing of a written application for a variance by a property owner or by a lessee with the consent of the owner, the planning commission shall give notice to properties which are immediately adjacent and opposite from the property in question. Such notice shall give intention to consider at a public hearing the granting of the variance. Upon the filing of an application for variance the secretary of the commission shall either place the matter on the agenda for consideration by the commission at a subsequent meeting, then give notice by mail of the time, place and purpose thereof to the applicant as well as to the public in general. No more than twenty days following the termination of the public hearing on a variance the planning commission shall announce its findings by a formal report, and such report shall recite among other things the facts and reasons which, in its opinion, made the granting or denial of the variance necessary to carry out the provisions and general purpose of this chapter, and shall order that the variance be granted or denied, and if such report orders that the variance be granted it shall also recite such conditions and limitations as it may impose. The formal report of the planning commission announcing its findings and orders after a hearing on an application for variance shall become a permanent record in the files of the planning commission. No later than ten days following the rendering of a decision ordering that a variance be granted or denied a copy of the report shall be mailed to the applicant and any other person requesting such report. (Prior code § 30-502.1)

 

17.56.030 Appeal.
        The order of the planning commission in granting or denying a variance shall become final and effective ten days after the rendering of its report granting or denying the variance unless within such ten day period an appeal in writing is filed with the council by any person dissatisfied with the decision of the planning commission. The filing of such appeal within such limit shall stay the effective date of the order of the planning commission until such time as the council has acted on the appeal. (Prior code § 30-502.2)

 

17.56.040 Council action—Granting or denial.
        A.    Upon request of a written appeal filed with the council as provided herein, the planning commission shall transmit to the council the planning commission’s complete record of the case. The city council shall, within a period not to exceed forty days following receipt of the written appeal, conduct a duly advertised public hearing, public notice of which shall be given as provided in Section 17.58.040.

        B.     The council shall announce its findings and decision by formal resolution not more than forty days following the termination of proceedings of the hearing. Such resolution shall recite among other things the facts and reasons which, in the opinion of the council, make the granting or denial of the variance necessary to carry out the general purpose of this chapter and shall order that the variance be granted or denied or modified subject to such conditions or limitations that it may impose. (Prior code § 30-502.3)

 

17.56.050 Copies of resolution for applicant and commission.
        Not later than ten days following the adoption of a resolution ordering that a variance be granted or denied, a copy of such resolution shall be mailed to the applicant and any other parties requesting notice of the action and one copy shall be attached to the planning commission’s file on the case and such file returned to the planning commission for permanent filing.

17.58.030 Hearing and notice—Planning commission.

(Prior code § 30-505.3)

 

17.58.050 Determination of findings.
        A.    If the planning commission finds that the public health, safety and general welfare warrant the change of regulations or zones, the planning commission may recommend such change to the city council and the city council may, by ordinance, effect such change. The planning commission shall not be bound to recommend the identical change of regulations on areas petitioned for or initiated, but may recommend a more restrictive zone or regulation or an area smaller than that originally petitioned for or initiated if such change is warranted by the public health, safety and general welfare.

        B.     If the planning commission finds that the public health, safety and general welfare does not warrant the change of zones or regulation said determination of findings shall be final and conclusive unless an appeal is filed with the city council as provided in Section 17.58.060.

        C.     In the case of petitions to rezone, if the planning commission fails to make a determination of finding either disapproving or approving said petition within sixty days after the close of public hearing thereon, said failure shall constitute approval of said petition; provided, that this time limitation shall not apply in the event the petitioner agrees to the delay.

17.72.10 Purpose and application.
        A.    The purpose of the coastal zone natural resources district is to protect those coastal areas in the city that have been identified containing environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA), including but not limited to riparian or wetland habitat, which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and could easily be degraded by human activities and developments, and to provide for a buffer zone to protect the wetlands. The uses of natural resource areas are limited to those in accordance with the designated coastal zone natural resource policies of the coastal land use plan. Further, the procedures to follow in order to specify the boundaries of any environmentally sensitive habitat and incentives to direct development away from such areas and to establish adequate protective buffer areas around such areas are provided by this district.

        A.    In all habitat areas, those recreational facilities included in a publicly adopted State Park and Recreation or Department of Fish and Game Master Plan.

        B.     In all habitat areas, wetland or stream restoration programs.

        C.     In riparian habitat areas and wetland buffer areas, recreational trails.

        D.    In riparian habitat areas, new roads where crossings shall be limited, when feasible, to right angle crossing of streams and stream corridors.

        E.     In all habitat areas, fences and access trails necessary to protect the area map be placed.

        F.     In all habitat areas, one single-family residence and appurtenant structure when denial of such would otherwise substantially deny all reasonable use of the parcel, including use of incentive density, and where such development will be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade the environmentally sensitive habitat area. Height limits shall be as in the R-1 district. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.72.040 General provisions.
        A.    The General Plan land use map identifies the locations of environmentally sensitive natural resource areas (wetlands and riparian habitat areas). Where question or dispute arise over the location of a habitat boundary the applicant shall provide the following information:

        1.     A base map delineating topographic lines, adjacent roads, and the location of all dikes, levees, flood control channels, tide gates, streams, rivers water bodies and wetlands located on the site;

        2.     A map of soils classifications on the site;

        3.     A vegetation habitat map of the site; and

        4.     A professional biologists report which shall include an adequate description of the flora, fauna, fish, birds, mammals, or other wildlife which occupy the site or are habitually found thereon, setting forth with detail those areas where federal or state listed plant and animal species or their habitats may be found on the site. The report shall include the findings of a site visit, discussion of soils and habitat classifications at the site, and any conclusions, recommendations and/or mitigating circumstances which address the boundary issue.

        5.     Any other information pertinent to the particular project which might be necessary for the review of the project requested by the City Planning department.

        The definitions of wetlands and riparian vegetation within the General Plan and consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shall be utilized for determinations.

        B.     ESHA Buffer. A buffer area of one hundred feet in width shall be maintained in a natural condition along the upland limits of all identified ESHA, to be measured from the outer boundary of such environmentally sensitive area. A buffer of less than one hundred feet may be utilized where it can be determined by the City that there is no adverse impact on the wetland. A determination to utilize a buffer area of less than one hundred feet shall be made in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game. The City’s determination shall be based upon specific findings as to the adequacy of the proposed buffer to protect the identified resource. The required rear, front and side yard setbacks of a parcel may be located within the buffer area; however, no development other than that specified by this chapter may take place within that portion of the yard setbacks located within the buffer area.

        C.     Riparian Vegetation Corridor. Native vegetation along any river, stream or creek shall be maintained from the top of highest bank on the opposite bank to the top of highest bank to provide bank stabilization, water quality and wildlife habitat. Additional setback from top of highest bank shall be required for geologic or flooding safety. Within this top of bank/safety area, the native vegetation canopy shall be retained. Native trees which canopy the watercourse shall be retained unless an existing structure is immediately threatened or a permitted use activity is approved. Where such a new permitted activity occurs native riparian vegetation shall be replaced and maintained on-site, in kind with native species. Where non-native vegetation is removed it shall be replaced and maintained on-site, in-kind with native species.

        D.    Any dredging and/or spoils disposal undertaken as part of the maintenance and repair of existing public facilities (such as flood-control and drainage channels, roads or road crossings or utilities) shall be planned and carried out to avoid significant disruption to marine and wildlife habitats and water circulation.

Chapter 17.74 COASTAL ZONE SIGNS
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.74, §§ 17.74.010—17.74.280, and enacted a new Chapter 17.74 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.74 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.74.010 Purpose.
        A.    The surroundings of the city are possessed of natural beauty having both giant redwoods and the Pacific Ocean at the disposal of its citizens. The city’s economy is dependent on a vigorous local business economy, spawned in part by tourism and its residential environment. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs in the city. Signs have an obvious impact on the character, quality and economic health of the city. As a prominent part of the scenery, signs may attract the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and help set the tone of the community.

        B.     It is the intent of the city that this chapter emphasize the importance of business activity to the economic vitality of the city, help improve the ability of business owners and operators to identify their businesses to the community to enhance the furtherance of commerce, foster varied and interesting places of trade and promote public safety by making business signing visible to the passing public. This chapter is further intended to encourage the use of signs that:

        1.     Protect and enhance the architectural character, harmony and natural beauty of the community, its buildings and its various neighborhoods and districts;

        2.     Protect commercial districts from sign clutter;

        3.     Protect the public’s ability to identify users and premises without confusion;

        4.     Eliminate unnecessary distractions which may jeopardize pedestrian or vehicular traffic safety;

        5.     Are as small in size and few in number as is consistent with their purpose of communicating identification and essential information;

        6.     Protect the right of the public to be directed, warned, advised and informed;

        7.     Possess a satisfactory aesthetic effect and pleasing elements of design that relates to the form, proportion, material, surface treatment and position;

        8.     Assure the maintenance of signs;

        9.     Implement the community design objectives expressed in the general plan;

        10.   Prohibit political signs on public utility or street sign poles because it is necessary to prevent visual distractions to motorists that create traffic hazards, prevent the obstruction of road hazards and road signs, and to prevent eyesores from proliferating along public streets;

        11.   Regulate the size of political signs because it is necessary for safety and aesthetic reasons, specifically that the strong winds common in the city would remove the signs, creating hazards and accumulation of debris, and extremely large or illuminated signs would create a distraction to motorists.

        C.     The general sign usage provisions and regulations of this chapter shall apply. The additional sign usage authorized hereunder shall be strictly construed in its application. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.75 COASTAL ZONE FENCES
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.75, §§ 17.75.010—17.75.060, and enacted a new Chapter 17.75 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.75 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.75.010 Purpose.
        Fences are permissible for all residential districts under conditions and restrictions as stated in this chapter. Fences are mandatory for specific uses and shall be erected as required. For those uses already existing, which do not have the required fencing, they shall be considered nonconforming and may continue in operation for an indefinite period of time as prescribed by the section on nonconforming uses. When such uses are proposed for remodeling, enlargement or extension of use, then they shall be required to conform to this section. For the purposes of definition, “fence” means a structure made of wire, wood, metal, masonry or other materials, and includes a hedge which is further defined as a barrier formed by branches, shrubs or small trees growing close together in a line with interwoven branches. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.75.020 In residential districts.
        Regulations for fences in residential districts shall include the following:

        A.    Front yards, maximum height above grade not to exceed thirty-six inches except that the fence may be erected to a maximum height of forty-eight inches; provided, that any fence which exceeds thirty-six inches is uniformly open to the extent of thirty-three and one-third percent. “Uniformly open” means that the interstices between the solid material of the fence are evenly spaced so as to make vision through the fence possible;

        B.     Rear yards, maximum height eight feet above grade;

        C.     Side yards, maximum height six feet above grade;

        D.    On a corner lot in any residential district, no fence shall be erected or plants permitted to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision between the height of two and one-half and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the lot lines of such corner lots in a line joining points along such lot lines twenty feet from the point of intersection. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.75.030 Exceptions—Corner and key lots.
        A.    Corner Lots. On corner lots which are not reversed corner lots, no fence or hedge exceeding thirty-six inches in height shall be permitted closer than five feet to the side street lot line.

        B.     Reversed Comer Lots. On reversed corner lots, no fence or hedge exceeding thirty-six inches in height shall be permitted closer than ten feet to the side street lot line.

        C.     Key Lots. In the front yard of a key lot on the side which abuts the rear yard of a reversed corner lot, a fence may be erected or a hedge permitted to grow to a maximum height of six feet up to a point of ten feet from the front property line. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.75.040 Parking lots or nonresidential development.
        A.    Parking Lots. A solid fence of six feet shall be maintained on the rear and side lot lines where said parking lot abuts or rears on property which is used or zoned for residential purposes and said parking lot is in an ownership separate from the adjacent properties. Fencing or screening for the street side property lines shall be in accordance with the development standards for parking lots in Section 17.76.120.

        B.     Nonresidential Development. The development of any property of a nonresidential nature shall include a minimum six-foot solid fence along the rear and side property lines when such property abuts or rears on property zoned or used for residential purposes. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.75.050 General provisions.
        A.    Electrically charged fences shall be prohibited in the city.

        B.     Barbed wire or other sharp pointed material shall be prohibited in the construction of a fence unless said material is over six feet above grade.

        C.     Fences which enclose school grounds, public playgrounds, tennis courts, public swimming pools or other public areas which are used for athletic purposes may be erected to a height in excess of six feet.

        D.    Corner lots must maintain the present requirements for visibility at intersections. (See subsection G. of Section 17.63.080). (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.75.060 Appeal.
        Any person aggrieved by the provisions of this chapter may appeal to the planning commission. The appeal procedures are described in Chapter 17.82. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.76 COASTAL ZONE OFF-STREET PARKING
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.76, §§ 17.76.010—17.76.170, and enacted a new Chapter 17.76 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.76 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.76.010 Purpose.
        The purpose of these off-street parking and loading regulations is to relieve congestion and provide for safe movement of traffic along public streets, to promote the general welfare and convenience and prosperity of residential, commercial and manufacturing developments which depend upon the availability of off-street parking facilities, and to protect adjacent residential neighborhoods from vehicular traffic and parking congestion generated by commercial and industrial uses. It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation who owns, leases, or controls a building or structure to fail, neglect or refuse to provide and maintain off-street parking and loading facilities as required in this chapter. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        2.     For the floor area proposed for expansion to an existing building;

        3.     Whenever a change of use creates an increase in number of parking spaces required;

        4.     When a use is no longer considered nonconforming pursuant to Chapter 17.80.

        B.     No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the use of any building nor a building permit issued for the erection or alteration of any building unless such use or building complies with the regulations of this chapter. This shall not be interpreted to interfere with the nonconforming use of any structure in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 17.80.

        C.     No parking space, covered parking space or loading area required for compliance with this chapter shall be discontinued, reduced or altered in any manner below the requirements established in this chapter unless otherwise provided or unless equivalent parking spaces, covered parking space or loading area is provided elsewhere in compliance with this chapter. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.76.030 Computation of number of spaces required.
        In computation of the number of off-street parking spaces required, a fractional space of one-half space or more shall be counted as one space. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.76.040 Residential parking space requirements.
        A.    One-family dwellings shall be provided with two covered parking spaces for each unit.

        B.     Two-family dwellings shall be provided with one covered parking space and one uncovered parking space for each dwelling unit. Covered parking spaces may be converted for living purposes provided a replacement parking space is available within the lot line.

        G.    Bed and breakfasts shall provide one parking space per guestroom.

        H.    Mobilehome parks shall be provided with two parking spaces for each mobilehome. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.76.050 Business parking space—Requirements generally.
        A.    The number of required off-street parking spaces shall be calculated from the square footage of the entire structure or use, including storage areas, mechanical equipment rooms, basements and similar areas unless otherwise designated in this chapter.

        B.     In the case of a building or group of buildings under one ownership but containing different uses with different parking requirements, the total parking to be provided shall be based on the sum of the requirements for each separate use.

        C.     If parking requirements for a use are not specifically listed in this section, parking shall be required on the same basis as the most comparable listed use as determined by the planning commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.79 SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.79, §§ 17.79.010—17.79.100, and enacted a new Chapter 17.79 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.79 pertained to Coastal Zone Site Plan and Architectural Review. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.79.010 Purposes and application.
        A.    The purposes of a site plan and architectural review are to permit the city to evaluate site plans and designs of structures to assure compatibility, harmony in appearance in neighborhoods, reduce negative impacts on adjacent properties and coastal visual resources, reduce the unnecessary destruction of the environment and ground cover to avoid the creation of hazardous conditions and drainage problems, to protect views to and along the coast and scenic areas, to minimize the alteration of natural landforms, and to ensure that development is compatible with the character of its surroundings, and subordinate to the character of its setting in designated “highly scenic areas;” to avoid monotonous and otherwise non-aesthetic development injurious to the overall community; to provide a vehicle to encourage full development of streets servicing the properties, and to assure full installation of all public utilities necessary to serve such properties.

        B.     Site plan review and architectural review provisions of this title shall apply to all permitted uses in the CZ-C2, CZ-HS, CZ-CW, CZ-O, CZ-NR, and the CZ-HD districts and shall be required of all uses subject to use permit. Site plan and architectural review does not substitute for or obviate the requirements for securing a coastal development permit consistent with all LCP requirements. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.020 Review committee.
        A.    The planning commission may establish a committee for such purposes consisting of the director of public works, the city planner, and two members of the planning commission. The members of the planning commission should be well-versed in the city’s general plan and enabling legislation. The committee may invite individuals of known expertise from within the community to assist in making such evaluations necessary to make comments and recommendations on site plans and architectural renderings submitted for consideration.

        B.     In the event that a member of the committee is required to review drawings of a project in which one of its members or its advisors has a business or professional interest, it shall seek the advice of a disinterested party. The committee will stand as established, and from time to time as conditions warrant, the planning commission may make such changes within such personnel as it deems fit. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.030 Procedures.
        A.    The applicant shall submit an application on a form provided by the director of public works, together with three copies of such site plans or elevations of buildings on which a review committee report is required. The site plan shall be drawn to a scale which shall equally indicate the full dimensions and information necessary for the committee to make an evaluation of the request. Architectural drawings shall be of such scale and contain such information to permit the committee to make a full evaluation of the outside appearance, color, texture of materials, and appurtenances necessary for the development of the structure.

        B.     Scale drawings of all signs which will be included within the subject property shall also be submitted concurrently with the site plan and architectural plans of any proposed project.

        C.     The visual resources impact analysis required by Section 17.84F.030 shall be provided for all development proposed on sites visible from publicly accessible vantage points including, but not limited to, streets and highways, trails, parklands, and coastal waters for which views to and along the coast and scenic areas may be potentially impacted.

        D.    The review committee may require additional information if necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and/or may authorize the omission of any or all drawings required by this section if they are not necessary. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.035 Review standards.
        A.    The committee shall review the application as to consistency with the applicable zoning, resource protection, parking and landscaping, fencing, signage, street, sidewalk and public services requirements as set forth by this Municipal Code including, but not limited to, Chapter 17.84F, Coastal Resource Protection—Visual Resources.

        B.     Where the City Council has adopted a development plan and/or development standards for a specifically defined neighborhood within the City the application shall also be reviewed for consistency with the criteria of such plan or standards.

        C.     Where a structure(s) forty-five years or older is proposed for remodel or demolition a review of the potential for impact upon a site listed on the National Historical Register or a site of local historical significance shall be made and considered in the architectural review decision. It is the goal of the City General Plan to encourage property owners and other land managers to preserve or rehabilitate important historical and cultural sites rather than destroying them.

        D.    In such case that a waiver, variance or special permit review is required review of the project shall not be completed until final action upon the waiver, variance or special permit is taken by the Planning Commission or City Council. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.040 Review, referral and action.
        A.    Within fifteen days after the submission of drawings and applications for review by this committee the committee shall meet to review the project. Subsequent to the meeting it shall render a written report recommending approval, approval with conditions or disapproval. Action by the committee shall be final unless the applicant seeks redress from the action of the committee by making appeals as set forth in this chapter.

        B.     Except as time requires to meet Section 17.79.035C. or D. above, if no action is taken by the committee thirty days after receipt of all drawings and applications it shall be deemed accepted and building permits may then be issued which are in compliance with the drawings submitted for review. If modifications are requested by the committee the time periods established shall not be resumed until revisions to the drawings as requested are resubmitted for consideration.

        C.     Approved plans, together with such conditions, and signed by the planning director shall be dated and mailed to the applicant and one copy placed in the files of the planning commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.050 Appeals to the planning commission.
        A.    Within ten days following the date of a decision of the review committee on any site plan or architectural review application, the decision may be appealed to the planning commission by the applicant or any other interested party. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the planning commission, and shall be filed with the secretary of said commission. The appeal shall state specifically where it is claimed that there was an error or abusive discretion by the committee and wherein its decision was not supported by evidence in the record.

        B.     Following the receipt of such an appeal application, the planning commission at its next regular meeting shall set a date of hearing at which time the applicant may make his presentation and shall at that time present to the commission the site drawings and structural renderings and all other data which was presented to the committee, together with his arguments on said appeal. Should the planning commission find favor with the appeal, the commission shall order the secretary of the commission to sign the documents and date such documents and submit a copy to the applicant and one copy to the records of the planning commission.

        C.     Should the decision of the planning commission be unfavorable to the applicant, the applicant may appeal such decision to the city council. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.060 Appeals to the city council.
        A.    Should an application for a site plan and architectural review meet with the disapproval of the planning commission or upon any of the modifications as decided by the commission, he may file with the city council a request for consideration by the city council. Such a request shall be on forms prescribed by the city council and the city council shall set a date of hearing upon such receipt.

        B.     At the public hearing set for such an appeal, the city council shall be provided with all of the material, recommendations and data reviewed by the planning commission and they shall at such a hearing, either affirm, deny, or amend the recommendations of the planning commission. The city council shall, in setting their public hearing, follow the procedures prescribed as set forth in Chapter 17.82. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.070 Development requirements and improvements.
        Consideration of approval of a site plan or architectural review shall include the requirements for the dedication of additional rights-of-way for ingress/egress and view corridors, the improvement of all public rights-of-way, the installation of underground utilities, and the provision of water, sewage, and drainage facilities, and applicable restrictions on exterior building materials, illumination, and landscaping as set forth in Section 17.84F.050. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.080 Building permits and occupation.
        A.    Before a building permit shall be issued for any building or structure proposed as part of an approved site plan or architectural design, the building official shall determine that the proposed building location facilities and improvements are in conformity with the plans and conditions approved by the review committee, the planning commission, or the city council.

        B.     Before a building may be occupied the building official shall certify that the site or structure has been developed in conformity with the plans and conditions approved in this chapter. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.090 Lapse of site plan or architectural design approval.
        A.    A site plan or architectural design approval shall lapse and shall become void one year following the date on which approval by the committee, planning commission or city council became effective unless prior to the expiration of one year a building permit is issued by the building official, and the construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site or structures which were the subject of the site plan or architectural design approval.

        B.     Approval may be extended for an additional period for periods of one year upon written application to the planning commission before expiration of the first approval. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.79.100 Site plan approval to run with the land.
        A site plan or architectural design approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall run with the land and shall continue to be valid upon the change of ownership of the site which was the subject of the site plan or architectural design approval, subject to the provisions of 17.79.090. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.80 COASTAL ZONE NONCONFORMING USES

*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.80, §§ 17.80.010—17.80.060, and enacted a new Chapter 17.80 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.80 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.80.010 Generally.
        Nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, signs and lots may be continued subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.80.020 Continuance of nonconforming uses of land.
        The lawful use of land existing on July 1, 1982, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, may be continued for a period of twenty years from July 1, 1982. A use of land which becomes nonconforming due to reclassification, change of ordinance or annexation may be continued for a period of twenty years from the date the use becomes nonconforming, except that a legally established non-conforming two-family and multiple dwelling use may be continued for a period of thirty years unless located within an area of industrial zoning. No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied when it became nonconforming. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.80.030 Nonconforming uses of structures.
        A.    Maintenance. A nonconforming use of a structure or building may be maintained indefinitely in the original condition except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

        B.     Change of Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may be changed to similar use allowed in the most restrictive zoning district which would permit the existing use or to a use allowed in a more restricted zoning classification. When a use is changed to a use permitted in a more restrictive zoning classification and the use shall not subsequently be changed to a use not permitted in the more restrictive zoning classification. No change of use will be permitted if the new use proposed requires a use permit.

        C.     Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded.

        D.    Signs. Identification signs may be permitted on structures or buildings housing a nonconforming use provided such signs are mounted on the wall of the building parallel to the street side property line and shall not project more than twelve inches from the wall of the building and provided further that the total sign areas shall not exceed one square foot for each linear foot of building facing a public road or street.

        E.     Discontinuance.

When such discontinuance has occurred, the premises or structure shall only be used for the purposes allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.

        F.     Damage or Destruction. Where a structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its market value as determined by the county assessor on the last equalized assessment roll, it shall not resume its nonconforming use but may be restored and used in conformity with the provisions of this title. Where a legally non-conforming two-family or multiple dwelling use is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, it may be considered for restoration, reconstruction or rebuilding subject to the following criteria:

        1.     The dwelling may be reconstructed, restored, or rebuilt up to its pre-damaged size and number of dwelling units, and its nonconforming use, if any, may be resumed.

        3.     The project shall be in compliance with the State Historical Building Code for work on qualified historical buildings or structures.

        4.     The project shall otherwise be constructed in compliance with City zoning ordinances so long as the pre-damaged size and number of units is maintained. Reconstruction of such units in an area zoned as industrial shall be prohibited. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.80.040 Nonconforming structures or buildings.
        A.    Maintenance. A nonconforming structure or building may be maintained indefinitely in the original condition except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

        B.     Enlargement or Alteration. No nonconforming building may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.

        C.     Repairs. Repairs of an ordinary nature may be made in any period of twelve consecutive months including repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring and plumbing to an extent not to exceed ten percent of the market value of the building as determined by the county assessor on the last equalized assessment roll. Work which is required to strengthen or to restore the building to a safe condition as determined and ordered by code enforcement official or other city or state officer by reason of statute or ordinance shall not be included within the ten percent limitation.

        D.    Damage or Destruction. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its market value as determined on the last equalized assessment roll at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title. Where a legally non-conforming two-family or multiple dwelling use is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, it may be considered for restoration, reconstruction or rebuilding subject to the following criteria:

        1.     The dwelling may be reconstructed, restored, or rebuilt up to its predamaged size and number of dwelling units, and its nonconforming use, if any, may be resumed.

        2.

        3.     The project shall be in compliance with the State Historical Building Code for work on qualified historical buildings or structures.

        4.     The project shall otherwise be constructed in compliance with City zoning ordinances so long as the pre-damage size and number of units is maintained.

        Reconstruction of such units in an area zoned as industrial shall be prohibited.

        E.     Relocation. If a nonconforming building is moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.80.050 Nonconforming lots.
        A.    A nonconforming lot shall not be reduced in area or width.

        B.     Any conforming use or conforming structure on a nonconforming lot may not be enlarged, extended or reconstructed.

        C.     A nonconforming lot to be used for residential purposes shall be subject to the density requirements of such zoning district in which it is located, except:

        1.     A single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a nonconforming lot located in any district in which a single-family dwelling is permitted, so long as all setback requirements are provided.

        D.    If two or more lots or combination of lots or portion of lots with continuous frontage single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width or area, the land involved shall be considered to be a single building site for purposes of this section and no portion of said building site shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes the degree of compliance with lot width and area requirements, nor shall any division of any building site be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirements stated in this title. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.80.060 Removal of nonconforming uses of land or structures.
        Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 17.80.020 and 17.80.030, upon a written complaint filed with the planning director by any aggrieved person, alleging that a nonconforming use of land or structures has become a public nuisance through decline in appearance, or through emissions of noise, smoke or vibrations, or through the conduct of its operations has become a persistent police problem, the planning director may refer the matter to the planning commission and the planning commission may, after a public hearing thereon, order the removal of the nonconforming use subject to the city’s obtaining a coastal development permit(s) for such removal or demolition. The planning commission may initiate such proceedings upon its own motion for any of the above-described causes. The procedure for notice, hearing and appeal shall be as set forth in Section 17.82.030. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.81 COASTAL ZONE AMENDMENTS AND REZONING
17.81.010 Permitted.
        Whenever the public health, safety and general welfare warrants, the city council may, by ordinance after a report by the planning commission and subject to the procedures provided in this chapter, amend, supplement or change the regulations for zoning of property now or hereafter established by these regulations. An amendment or rezoning may be initiated by the planning commission, the city council, or by a petition of property owners or authorized agents of such owners. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.81.020 Petitions for rezoning.
        Petitions for rezoning of property shall be filed with the planning department upon such forms and accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by the planning commission. In addition, the notice and procedure requirements of the Coastal Commission’s local coastal program regulations shall also apply to all petitions for rezoning and amendments. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.81.030 Hearing and notice—Planning commission.
        A.    Upon the initiation or filing of such petition for rezoning or upon the initiation of procedure for an amendment, the same shall be set for hearing before the planning commission by the planning director.

        B.     Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be given by the following method:

        1.     Amendment Hearings. At least one publication in the official newspaper of the city at least ten working days prior to the date of the hearing.

        2.     Proposed Rezoning Hearings. Publication of at least one notice in the official newspaper of the city at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. At least seven days before the hearing of said rezoning a notice of said hearing shall be mailed to the petitioners and to residents and owners of properties which are within three hundred feet of the property proposed to be rezoned, and to those names on record requesting such notices. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.81.040 Hearing and notice by city council.
        A.    The city council, upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning commission on amendment or rezoning, shall set the same for hearing.

        B.     Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be given by causing a notice thereof to be published in at least one regular issue of the official newspaper of the city at least ten days before said hearing. No hearing shall be required for a planning commission denial on a rezoning; however, in the event of an appeal, Section 17.81.060 shall be the procedure for the city council in hearing an appeal on a recommendation of denial by the planning commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.81.050 Determination of findings.
        A.    If the planning commission finds that the public health, safety, and general welfare warrant the change of regulations or zones, and such change is consistent with the applicable land use policies set forth in the coastal element of the general plan, the planning commission may recommend such change to the city council. The city council may, by ordinance, effect such change upon approval by state’s Coastal Commission. The planning commission shall not be bound to recommend the identical change of regulations on areas petitioned for or initiated but may recommend a more restrictive zone or regulation or an area smaller than that originally petitioned for or initiated if such change is warranted by the public health, safety, and general welfare and is consistent with the applicable land use policies set forth in the coastal element of the general plan. Such process shall not take less than six weeks.

        B.     If the planning commission finds that the public health, safety, and general welfare does not warrant the change of zones or regulation or such change is not consistent with the applicable policies set forth in the coastal element of the general plan, said determination of findings shall be final and conclusive unless an appeal is filed with the city council as provided in Section 17.81.060.

        C.     In the case of petitions to rezone, if the planning commission fails to make a determination of finding either disapproving or approving said petition within sixty days after the close of public hearing thereon, said failure shall constitute approval of said petition; provided, that this time limitation shall not apply in the event the petitioner agrees to the delay. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Any persons dissatisfied with any action of the planning commission on an amendment or rezoning may appeal therefrom to the city council at any time within ten days after rendition of the decision of the planning commission. The appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the city and a copy thereof with the planning commission. Upon filing a notice of appeal, the planning director must, within ten days, transmit all exhibits, notices, affidavits, orders, and other papers and documents on file with the planning commission, together with the report of the commission to the city council.

Chapter 17.82 COASTAL ZONE USE PERMITS
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.82, §§ 17.82.010—17.82.070, and enacted a new Chapter 17.82 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.82 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.82.010 Purpose.
        A.    These provisions do not negate the specific uses designated for each zoning district, but rather serve as a supplemental guide providing added protection to existing zoning districts and at the same time encouraging orderly growth.

        B.     The purpose of issuing a use permit shall be:

        1.     To assure that the degree of compatibility with the purpose of this chapter be maintained with respect to the particular use on a particular side and consideration of other existing and potential uses within the general area in which such use is proposed to be located; and

        2.     To recognize and compensate for variations in degree of technological processes and equipment as related to the factors of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, and hazards;

        3.     To assure that such use will be placed on a site that is both suitable and adequate and that the use will have a minor effect on present and future traffic and that such use will not become a nuisance to the neighborhood and such use conforms to the priorities for development in each district and with the policies of the land use plan and makes provisions for adequate off-street parking and loading, as well as landscaping and screen planning, as well as other matters pertinent to the particular case. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.82.020 Conditional and revocable.
        All use permits are always revocable and may be made conditional or valid for a specific time period and shall be issued by the planning commission or by the affirmative vote of the city council upon appeal for any of the uses for which a use permit is required by the terms of this title. Use permits must be obtained for those uses designated as requiring use permits under these regulations, whether use be in connection with new construction, additions or enlargements or extensions of use. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.82.030 Applications for permits.
        A.    Applications for a use permit or a special use permit or a temporary use permit shall be made to the planning director in writing on a form prescribed by the commission and shall be accompanied by plans, sketch plans, and elevations of the building. Applications filed under this section shall be accompanied by such fees as shall from time to time be set or established by resolution of the city council. Every application for a use permit or special use permit or temporary use permit shall be signed by the owner of the property for which the permit is sought, or his agent. In the case of leased premises the owner of the underlying fee title or his agent shall sign the application.

        B.     Use permits and special use permits and temporary permits are not personal to the applicant. Permission granted under a use permit or a special use permit or a temporary use permit is an incident of ownership of the property for which it is granted. The owner of the property shall be responsible for compliance with the terms and conditions of issuance, if any, of a use permit or special use permit or a temporary use permit.

        C.     Applications for use permits, special use permits or temporary use permits shall be either referred directly by the planning director to the planning commission for public hearing and decision or where such is the case, be considered by the planning director and processed by him, in which event he shall make his written determination and transmit a copy thereof to the applicant. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.83 SPECIAL ZONING USES
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.83, §§ 17.83.010—17.83.030, and enacted a new Chapter 17.83 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.83 pertained to Coastal Zone Transitional Zoning and Uses. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.83.010 Senior second units.
        A.    A coastal development permit for a second residential unit for seniors may be administratively authorized without a discretionary hearing provided:

        1.     The parcel on which the second unit would be sited is twice the minimum lot size of the zoning district in which it is located; and

        2.     The development of the second unit would be consistent with all policies and standards of the certified LCP, including but not limited to:

        3.     The second unit would not obstruct public access to and along the coast, or public trails.

        4.     The second unit would not significantly obstruct public views from any public road, trail, or public recreation area to, and along the coast and would be compatible with the character of the area.

        5.     All development associated with the second unit would provide adequate buffers from environmentally sensitive habitat areas consistent with all local coastal program requirements.

        6.     The means of accommodating the second unit: (1) would not have an adverse effect on coastal resources (2) would ensure adequate services will be provided to serve the proposed development; and (3) would not displace Coastal Act priority uses. If the means for accommodating a second unit will have an adverse effect on coastal resources, will not ensure adequate services will be provided to serve the proposed development, or will displace priory uses, the second unit shall be denied.

        B.     Where an CZ-R1 designated parcel does not qualify for a second dwelling unit due to a lack of possessing twice the minimum lot size, a use permit for a temporary second dwelling use with kitchen facilities within an existing residence, or as part of a structural addition to an existing residence, in a zone restricting residential use to a one-family unit, may be considered by the Planning Commission as a use permit for seniors in any legally existing single-family residence subject to all of the following:

        1.     The senior second dwelling unit use shall be used for the sole occupancy of one to two specifically named adult persons who are sixty-two years of age or over.

        2.     The total designated floor area for the second dwelling use shall not exceed thirty percent of the floor area of the entire structure, including any proposed addition. However, under no circumstances shall the floor area of the second unit exceed seven hundred square feet.

        3.     The habitable floor area of the second dwelling use shall maintain direct, internal access to the habitable floor area of the primary residence, and a direct exist outside. For purposes of this section, habitable floor areas shall include interior hallways.

        4.     Any structural additions or alterations shall comply with all building, zoning, health and fire code requirements.

        5.     Utilities for the second dwelling area (electricity, water, sewage disposal, etc.) shall be integrated into those of the primary residence.

        6.     When the specified occupant(s) of the senior second dwelling use no longer reside in the unit or no longer qualifies for the use permitted under these provisions, the kitchen facilities shall be removed, the area integrated into the primary unit, and the area no longer used for second dwelling purposes.

        7.     The development of the second unit would be consistent with all policies and standards of the certified LCP, including but not limited to:

        a.     The second unit would not obstruct public access to and along the coast, or public trails.

        b.     The second unit would not significantly obstruct public views from any public road, trail, or public recreation area to, and along the coast and would be compatible with the character of the area.

        c.     All development associated with the second unit would provide adequate buffers from environmentally sensitive habitat areas consistent with all local coastal program requirements. The means of accommodating the second unit: (1) would not have an adverse effect on coastal resources (2) would ensure adequate services will be provided to serve the proposed development; and (3) would not displace Coastal Act priority uses. If the means for accommodating a second unit will have an adverse effect on coastal resources, will not ensure adequate services will be provided to serve the proposed development, or will displace priory uses, the second unit shall be denied. The use permit shall be subject to annual review and verification of compliance by the planning department or planning commission. A use permit renewal fee, in an amount determined by the City Council, may be charged. Nothing in this section substitutes for or obviates the requirement to obtain a coastal development permit pursuant to Chapter 17.84. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.83.020 Reasonable housing accommodation for persons with disabilities.
        It is the policy of the city to provide fair access to housing for persons with disabilities, including providing reasonable accommodation in the application of its zoning laws pursuant to federal and state law. This title provides for residential care facilities as set forth by California Health and Safety Codes within specified residential and commercial districts. Where a request for accommodation beyond these provisions is made the following shall apply:

        A.    Application for Accommodation. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by submittal of an application to the City Planning Department. Certain factors provide the factual information necessary to develop a balance between the city’s interest and the need for housing. Consideration of these factors will vary depending on whether the request is being made in a residential or commercial zoning district, and they can only include the physical impacts of the proposed use, not the type of residents. The factors to be considered for reasonable accommodation include the following:

        1.     Special needs created by the disability.

        2.     Potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested accommodation.

        3.     Potential impact of the request on surrounding uses.

        4.     Potential hazardous impact of surrounding environment upon the requested accommodation.

        5.     Physical attributes of the property and structures.

        6.     Alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit.

        7.     In the case of a determination involving a single family dwelling, whether the household would be considered a single family dwelling if it were not using special services which are required because of the disabilities of the residents.

        8.     Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city.

        9.     Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program.

        B.     City Programs. The following have been identified as city programs which should be considered with respect to requests for reasonable accommodation:

        1.     Health and Safety. The city is charged with ensuring the health and safety standards which are embodied in the Housing Code, Fire Code, Building Codes (including plumbing, mechanical and electrical), and the National Flood Insurance Program. The following are minimum health and safety standards which are not subject to variance.

        a.     Occupancy Standards. The most current California Building Code and Model Building Code (as adopted by the State of California) which have been adopted by the city prescribe the maximum number of persons per sleeping area which shall be applied.

        b.     Exiting. The most current California Building Code and Model Building Code which have been adopted by the city prescribe exiting requirements.

        c.     FEMA—Flood Insurance Program. The city is subject to potential flood, coastal erosion and tsunami damage. A request is located within an area designated as Zone A, B or V15 of the most current Flood Insurance Rate Map, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall be subject to the requirements of the city’s Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (Chapter 15.32 Municipal Code).

        d.     Building permits. Building permits will be required for new construction and changes to existing structures as prescribed by the most recently adopted California Building Code, Uniform Building Code and Americans with Disabilities Act.

        2.     Residential zoning district. The city recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing the livability of existing neighborhoods throughout the community. The city encourages a variety and mix of housing types to provide adequate choices for housing to all persons and recognizes the need to conserve the existing housing stock and preserve the environment and livability of existing residential neighborhoods. The city will therefore review requests with particular consideration given to the following issues:

        a.     Residential Character. If the accommodation is requested in a residential zoning district, then it is reasonable to require that the house retain a residential character. This means that its interior and exterior design should be consistent with the style of residential structures around it. In order to promote a cohesive living environment, homes should contain sufficient common areas for the number of residents: including, at a minimum, a kitchen, dining area and living room large enough to serve the residents, and, in the case of larger residences, congregating or recreational rooms and adequate bathrooms.

        b.     Parking. Recognizing that the parking demand for persons with disabilities is often less than for a similarly situated non-disabled household, the following factors should be considered in reviewing an accommodation request:

        •  Nature of the disability, with respect to the ability to or likelihood to drive.

        •  Proximity to public transit.

        •  Number of non-driving persons.

        •  Development of an alternate parking plan or resident transportation program.

        In general, residential uses in one-family dwellings, which involve staff who also live at the premises, should meet the following guidelines:

        i.      One off-street parking space for the first six client beds, and

        ii.     One off-street parking space for every four client beds (or portion thereof) above the first six, and

        iii.    One off-street parking space for each employee or staff member.

        C.     Notices and Hearings.

        1.     Within thirty days of the application, a Notice of Accommodation Decision is to be issued by the Planning Director and mailed to the applicant, adjacent property owners and any party who has requested notice of such determinations in writing. Adjacent is defined as those properties which share property lines with the proposed location or are directly across the street from the property for which reasonable accommodation is being requested.

        2.     Within ten working days of the Notice of Accommodation Decision being mailed, any person may make a written appeal of the Directors decision to the Planning Commission. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and remedy requested. If no request is received, then the decision of the Director will be final.

        3.     If appeal is received a public hearing shall be scheduled at the next reasonable available Planning Commission meeting. The decision of the Planning Commission is final. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.83.030 Incentives for affordable housing.
        The city wishes to provide a balance in housing types for all households in the community. Pursuant to Section 65915 et seq. of the California Government Code, and consistent with the California Coastal Act, the city will consider developers proposals to provide housing for very low and low income households by the provision of a density bonus for housing developments when issues of providing such housing in an affordable manner arise. Such bonus shall be made subject to the following provisions:

        A.    Qualification. In order to quality for a density bonus, a project must be a low or very low income or senior citizen housing project developed in compliance with the Section 65915 et seq. For a low income project, at least twenty percent of the units shall be low income affordable, for very low income projects not less than ten percent shall be very low income affordable, and for senior citizen projects not less than fifty percent of the units shall be restricted to senior citizens.

        B.     Limitation. Density bonuses shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the maximum density permitted by the applicable General Plan land use designation for the subject property. For example, where the maximum allowable density based upon a land use designation is twelve units per acre, the density bonus shall not exceed three units per acre, yielding a total allowable density, with the bonus, of fifteen units per acre. The final project unit total would then be calculated based upon the project property size.

        C.     Application. An application for a density bonus shall be made in conjunction with the other required applications for the development, including those for coastal development permits, and shall be subject to the same procedures required by those applications.

        D.    Affordability Cost Analysis. The developer shall include in the application for density bonus a cost analysis of the proposed project, with and without density bonus, demonstrating the cost per dwelling unit and projecting sales and/or rental costs for residents. The city shall include in its review of the application a written finding as to the need for incentive or development standards waiver for the provision of affordable housing as set forth in Section 50052.2 of the Health and Safety Code. The city may deny the request if affordable housing can be provided without the requested incentives.

        E.     Maintenance of affordable units. In exchange for the density bonus, the developer shall guarantee the units will be maintained for very low and low income households for thirty years. The guarantee shall be in the form of a deed restriction or other legally binding and enforceable document acceptable to the City Council. The document shall be recorded with the Del Norte County Recorder prior to the issuance of a building permit. The applicant shall comply with Crescent City Housing Authority procedures for the physical maintenance of the units.

        F.     Development Standards.

        1.     All residential projects granted a density bonus shall conform to the development standards applicable, except those standards regulating density or as waived under this section.

        2.     Where a proposed project is to be phased in its construction the number bonus units shall either be proportionately allocated between the phases or provided in the last phase of construction.

        3.     Any housing development granted a density bonus including those approved pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, shall be consistent with all certified Local Coastal Program policies and development standards.

        G.    Waiver of Development Standards. If the applicant can demonstrate that the increased density cannot physically be accommodated on the site then the following development standards shall be waived during site plan review to accommodate the increase density. The waiver in the standards shall follow the priority order hereby established and the applicant shall demonstrate that the increased density cannot be accommodated with each sequential waiver before the waiver of the next standard is allowed. Only one standard shall be waived unless it is shown that each individual standard waiver will not physically accommodate the proposed density. A complete site plan and floor plan shall be provided to demonstrate the physical noncompliance. Priority order for waiver is:

        1.     A higher percentage of compact parking;

        2.     Reduction in distance between buildings, subject to compliance with safety codes;

        3.     Reduction in rear yard setbacks;

        4.     One additional floor of building height above the zoning district standard;

        5.     Reduction in side yard setbacks;

        6.     Reduction in number of required parking spaces (but not less than one space per unit);

        7.     Reduction in front yard setbacks; and

        8.     Reduction in parking lot landscaping standards.

        H.    Nothing in this section substitutes for or obviates the requirement to obtain a coastal development permit pursuant to Chapter 17.84.

        I.      Notwithstanding the demonstration of qualifications for a density bonus and/or a waiver of development standards set forth above, in reviewing a proposed density bonus and/or any related waiver of development standards, the city shall identify all feasible means of accommodating the density bonus and/or complying with the subject development standards, taking into consideration the effects of such means on coastal resources. The city shall only grant a density bonus and/or related development standards waiver if the city determines that the means of accommodating the additional density bonus and/or constructing the project under the waived development standards as proposed by the applicant would not have an adverse effect on coastal resources. If, however, the city determines that the means for accommodating the density bonus and/or constructing the project under the waived development standards as proposed by the applicant would have an adverse effect on coastal resources, the city shall not grant the density bonus and/or waiver to development standards. For the purposes of this section, “coastal resources” means any resource which is afforded protection under the policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, California Public Resources Code Section 30200 et seq., including but not limited to public access, marine and other aquatic resources, environmentally sensitive habitat, and the visual quality of coastal areas. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        B.     Pursuant to Section 65852.3 of California Government Code, the manufactured homes installed pursuant to this section shall conform to the following:

        1.     The unit shall be placed on a permanent foundation system pursuant to Section 18551 of the Health and Safety Code.

        2.     The unit shall have a roof overhang of not less than four inches on any side, or portion thereof, and not less than six inches on each end of the unit. “End” is defined as the pulling front of each section and the rear of each transported section.

        3.     Roofing material must consist of composition or similar shingles or tile, including a simulated tile.

        4.     The exterior covering material shall be a conventional home siding such as a vertical or horizontal wood base product siding or masonry, vinyl or aluminum horizontal siding.

        5.     The exterior covering material shall extend to within six inches of the ground, except that when a solid concrete or masonry perimeter foundation is used the exterior covering material need not extend below the top of the foundation.

        C.     The manufactured home placement shall be subject to the same hazard standards (bluff, FEMA, etc.) as any conventional residence which would be placed on the same site.

        D.    Nothing in this section substitutes for or obviates the requirement to obtain a coastal development permit pursuant to Chapter 17.84. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.83.060 Mobilehome Parks in residential areas.
        Subject to the issuance of a use permit, mobilehome parks, as defined in Section 18214 of the Health and Safety Code, are permitted on all land designated by the General Plan and zoned as residential, provided that:

        A.    Project density, including existing or non-mobilehome park residential development, does not exceed that designated to the parcel by the land General Plan use designation for the subject parcel;

        B.     Project development shall meet the adopted mobilehome park development standards;

        C.     Setbacks from the exterior property boundaries of the project shall be observed;

        D.    Parking shall be as for one-family dwellings;

        E.     Fractional time owners shall have limited rights to use their units including a maximum use of ninety days per calendar year with a maximum of thirty consecutive days of use during any sixty day period and a maximum of thirty days during the summer season (beginning the day before the Memorial Day weekend and ending the day after Labor Day).

        F.     No person shall occupy any unit or units within a given facility for more than sixty days per calendar year and no more than thirty days during the summer season (beginning the day before the Memorial Day weekend and ending the day after Labor Day).

        G.    When an individual owner chooses not to occupy his/her unit, that unit shall be added to the pool of hotel rooms available to the general public.

        H.    When an owner of a fractional interest in a unit chooses not to occupy his/her unit for any portion of the time allotted to him/her, that unit shall be available to the general public on the same basis as the traditional hotel units.

        I.      The facility shall have an on-site hotel operator to manage rental of all guestroom units.

        J.      The hotel owner/operator shall retain control and ownership of all structures, recreational amenities, meeting space, restaurants, “back of house” and other non-guest facilities.

        K.    The timeshare/resort hotel facility shall be operated as a hotel, managing all guestroom/units as part of the hotel inventory, including requirements for a centralized reservations booking system, mandatory front desk check-in and check-out services, advertising, security, maintenance, cleaning services, daily housecleaning, and preparing units for use by guests and owners.

        O.    The hotel owner/operator shall be required to submit, prior to issuance of a coastal development permit, for the review and approval of the Planning Director, a Declaration of Restrictions or CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions 8 Restrictions), either of which shall include: (a) all the specific restrictions listed above; (b) acknowledgement that these same restrictions are independently imposed as condition requirements of the coastal development permit; (c) a statement that provisions of the Declaration/CC&Rs that reflect the requirements of A. through M. above cannot be changed without approval of an LCP amendment by the Coastal Commission and subsequent coastal development permit amendment, provided however, that minor changes that do not conflict with above restrictions may be processed as an amendment to the coastal development permit, unless it is determined by the Planning Director that an amendment is not legally required. If there is a section of the Declaration/CC&Rs related to amendments, 
  and the statement provided pursuant to this paragraph is not in that section, then the section on amendments shall cross-reference this statement and clearly indicate that it controls over any contradictory statements in the section of the Declaration/CC&Rs on amendments; and (d) the CC&Rs or Declaration of Restrictions described above shall be recorded against all individual property titles simultaneously with the recordation of the condominium airspace map.

        P.     The hotel owner/operator or any successor-in-interest hotel owner/operator shall maintain the legal ability to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions stated above at all times in perpetuity and shall be responsible in all respects for ensuring that all parties subject to these restrictions comply with the restrictions. Each owner of a fractional interest in a unit is jointly and severally liable with the hotel owner/operator for violations of the terms and conditions hereof imposed by the special conditions of the coastal development permit. Violations of the coastal development permit can result in penalties pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 30820.

        Q.    All documents related to the marketing and sale of the fractional interest units, including marketing materials, sales contracts, deeds, CC & R’s and similar documents, shall notify buyers of the following: (a) the owners of a fractional interest in a unit are jointly and severally liable with the hotel owner/operator for any violations of the terms and conditions hereof imposed by the coastal development permit; and (b) the occupancy of the units is restricted to ninety days per calendar year with a maximum of thirty consecutive days of use during any sixty day period and a maximum of thirty days during the summer season (beginning the day before the Memorial Day weekend and ending the day after Labor Day), and when not in use by the owner, the unit shall be made available for rental by the hotel operator to the general public and that the coastal development permit contains additional restrictions on use and occupancy.

        R.     The hotel owner/operator and any successor-in-interest hotel owner/operator, and each future owner of a fractional interest in a unit shall obtain, prior to sale of a fractional interest, a written acknowledgement from the buyer that occupancy by the owner is limited to ninety days per calendar year with a maximum of thirty consecutive days of use during any sixty day period and a maximum of thirty days during the summer season (beginning the day before the Memorial Day weekend and ending the day after Labor Day), that the unit must be available for rental by the hotel operator to the general public when not occupied by the owner, and that there are further restrictions on use and occupancy in the coastal development permit and the CC&Rs or Declaration of Restrictions.

        S.     The hotel owner/operator and any successor-in-interest hotel owner/operator shall monitor and record hotel occupancy and use by the general public and the owners of a fractional interest in a unit throughout each year. The monitoring and record keeping shall include specific accounting of owner usage for each individual guestroom/unit. The records shall be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the restrictions set forth above in this section. The hotel owner-operator shall also maintain documentation of rates paid for hotel occupancy and of advertising and marketing efforts. All such records shall be maintained for ten years and shall be made available to the city, and to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission upon request and to the auditor required below. Within thirty days of commencing hotel operations, the hotel owner/operator shall submit notice to the Planning Director and to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission of commencement of hotel operations.

        T.     Within ninety days of the end of the first calendar year of hotel operations, and within ninety days of the end of each succeeding calendar year, the hotel owner/operator shall retain an independent auditing company, approved by the Planning Director, to perform an audit to evaluate compliance with special conditions of the coastal development permit which are required by this Section regarding notice, recordkeeping, and monitoring of the timeshare/resort hotel. The audit shall evaluate compliance by the hotel owner/operator and owners of fractional interests in a unit during the prior calendar year period. The hotel owner/operator shall instruct the auditor to prepare a report identifying the auditor’s findings, conclusions and the evidence relied upon, and such report shall be submitted to the Planning Director, for review and approval, and shall be available to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission upon request, within six months after the conclusion of each one year period of 
hotel operations. After the initial five calendar years, the one-year audit period may be extended to two years upon written approval of the Planning Director. The Planning Director may grant such approval if each of the previous audits revealed compliance with all restrictions imposed above. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.84 COASTAL ZONE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMITS AND APPEALS
Note
*       Editor’s note—Ord. of 2-22-2011(1), adopted February 22, 2011, repealed the former Chapter 17.84, §§ 17.84.010—17.84.040, and enacted a new Chapter 17.84 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.84 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

 

17.84.010 Purpose.
        The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for those areas, types of development, and activities within the coastal zone that require a coastal development permit as prescribed in the Coastal Act of 1976, and to establish procedures for making application for such permit, reviewing applications, providing notice of such development proposals, conducting public hearings for consideration of the permit request, and to provide recourse if an appellant is aggrieved by any order, requirement, permit, decision or determination made by the planning director, planning commission, and/or the City Council in the administration or enforcement of these regulations. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.012 Coastal development permit required for development.
        Except as provided in Section 17.84.014 of this chapter, any applicant wishing to undertake a “development,” as defined in Section 17.61.131, in the coastal zone shall obtain a coastal development permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, in addition to any other permit required by law. Development undertaken pursuant to a coastal development permit shall conform to the plans, specifications, terms and conditions approved in granting the permit. The procedures prescribed herein may be used in conjunction with other procedural requirements of the approving authority, provided that the minimum requirements as specified herein are assured. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.013 Coastal development permit exemptions.
        Notwithstanding any other provision of the Coastal Act, no coastal development permit shall be required pursuant to this chapter for the following types of development and in the following areas:

        A.    Improvements to existing single-family residences; provided, however, that the commission shall specify, by regulation, those classes of development which involve a risk of adverse environmental effect and shall require that a coastal development permit be obtained pursuant to this chapter.

        B.     Improvements to any structure other than a single-family residence or a public works facility; provided, however, that the commission shall specify, by regulation, those types of improvements which: (1) involve a risk of adverse environmental effect; (2) adversely affect public access; or (3) involve a change in use contrary to any policy of this chapter. Any improvement so specified by the commission shall require a coastal development permit.

        C.     Maintenance dredging of existing navigation channels or moving dredged material from those channels to a disposal area outside the coastal zone, pursuant to a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        D.    Repair or maintenance activities that do not result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of, the object of those repair or maintenance activities; provided, however, that if the Coastal Commission determines that certain extraordinary methods of repair and maintenance involve a risk of substantial adverse environmental impact, it shall, by regulation, require that a permit be obtained pursuant to this chapter.

        E.     Any category of development, or any category of development within a specifically defined geographic area, that the California Coastal Commission, after public hearing, and by two/thirds vote of its appointed members, has described or identified and with respect to which the commission has found that there is no potential for any significant adverse effect, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources or on public access to or along, the coast. Those categories of exemption, which may be requested to be granted by local governments pursuant to Title 14, California Code of Regulations, sections 13240-13249, are described in Orders of Categorical Exclusion adopted by the California Coastal Commission.

        F.     The installation, testing and placement in service or the replacement of any necessary utility connection between an existing service facility and any development approved pursuant to Title 17, Crescent City Municipal Code; provided, however, that where necessary, reasonable conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts on coastal resources, including scenic resources may be required as a part of the Title 17 entitlement(s).

        G.    The replacement of any structure, other than a public works facility, destroyed by natural disaster. Such replacement structure shall conform to applicable existing zoning requirements, shall be for the same use as the destroyed structure, shall not exceed either the floor area, height, or bulk of the destroyed structure by more than ten percent, and shall be sited in the same location on the affected property as the destroyed structure. As used in this subdivision, “natural disaster” means any situation in which the force or forces which destroyed the structure to be re-placed were beyond the control of its owner. As used in this subdivision, “bulk” means total interior cubic volume as measured from the exterior surface of the structure.

        H.    Any activity anywhere in the coastal zone that involves the conversion of any existing multiple-unit residential structure to a time-share project, estate, or use, as defined in Section 11003.5 of the Business and Professions Code. If any improvement to an existing structure is otherwise exempt from the permit requirements of this division, no coastal development permit shall be required for that improvement on the basis that it is to be made in connection with any conversion exempt pursuant to this subdivision. The division of a multiple-unit residential structure into condominiums, as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, shall not be considered a time-share project, estate, or use for purposes of this subdivision. Conversions of visitor-serving accommodations, whether in part of wholly, to a condominium, time-share project, estate, or use shall require a coastal development permit. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.014 Limitations on coastal development permit exemptions.
        A.    Notwithstanding the exemptions contained in Section 30610 of the Coastal Act and Section 17.84.013 above, a local coastal development permit shall be required pursuant to this chapter for the following types of development and in the following areas:

        1.     Improvements to existing single-family residences, specifically: (a) all fixtures and other structures directly attached to a residence; (b) structures on the property normally associated with a single-family residence, such as garages, swimming pools, fences, and storage sheds; but not including guest houses or self-contained residential units; and (c) landscaping on the lot; where the development involves a risk of adverse environmental effect. The following classes of development require a coastal development permit because they involve a risk of adverse environmental effects:

        a.     Improvements to a single-family structure if the structure or improvement is located: (1) on a beach; (2) in a wetland; (3) seaward of the mean high tide line; (4) in an environmentally sensitive habitat area; (5) in an area designated as highly scenic in a certified land use plan; or (6) within fifty feet of the edge of a coastal bluff;

        b.     Any significant alteration of land forms including removal or placement of vegetation, on a beach, wetland, or sand dune, or within fifty feet of the edge of a coastal bluff, or in environmentally sensitive habitat areas;

        c.     On property not included in Section 17.84.014.A.1.a. above that is located between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within three hundred feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tide of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance, or in significant scenic resources areas as designated by the Coastal Commission or Regional Commission, improvement that would result in an increase of ten percent or more of internal floor area of an existing structure or an additional improvement of ten percent or less where an improvement to the structure had previously been undertaken pursuant to Section 17.84.014.A.1, increase in height by more than ten percent of an existing structure and/or any significant non-attached structure such as garages, fences, shoreline protective works or docks;

        d.

        e.     Improvement to a single-family structure or accessory structure, which requires a building permit, within a coastal zone district where the improvements are not otherwise excepted by the zoning standards of the district;

        f.      Improvements in areas which the Coastal Commission has declared by resolution after public hearing to have a critically short water supply that must be maintained for the protection of coastal resources or public recreational use, the construction of any specified major water using development not essential to residential use including but not limited to swimming pools, or the construction or extension of any landscaping irrigation system;

        g.     Any addition to a single-family residence where the development permit issued for the original structure by the Commission or Regional Commission indicated that any future additions would require a development permit;

        h.     The expansion or construction of any septic systems or domestic water wells.

        2.     Improvements to any structure other than a single-family residence or a public works facility, entailing the structure itself as well as: (a) all fixtures and other structures directly attached to the structure; and (b) landscaping on the lot where the improvements (1) involve a risk of adverse environmental effect, (2) adversely affect public access, or (3) involve a change in use contrary to any policy of this title, a coastal development permit shall be required. The following classes of development require a coastal development permit because they involve one or more of the above listed effects:

        a.     Improvement to any structure if the structure or the improvement is located: on a beach; in a wetland, stream, or lake; seaward of the mean high tide line; in an area designated as highly scenic in a certified land use plan; or within fifty feet of the edge of a coastal bluff;

        b.     Any significant alteration of land forms including removal or placement of vegetation, on a beach or sand dune; in a wetland or stream; within one hundred feet of the edge of a coastal bluff, in a highly scenic area, or in an environmentally sensitive habitat area;

        c.     On property not included in subsection (b)(1) above that is located between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within three hundred feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tide of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance, or in significant scenic resource areas as designated by the commission or regional commission an improvement that would result in an increase of ten percent or more of internal floor area of the existing structure, or constitute an additional improvement of ten percent or less where an improvement to the structure has previously been undertaken pursuant to Section 17.84.014.A.2., and/or increase in height by more than ten percent of an existing structure;

        d.     Improvements to structures, which require a building permit, within either resource conservation area zone district, a coastal (hazard) zone district or within an area appealable to the California Coastal Commission pursuant to this chapter;

        e.     Improvements to a structure within a coastal zone district where the improvements are not other-wise excepted by the standards of the district;

        f.      Improvements in areas which the Coastal Commission has declared by resolution after public hearing to have a critically short water supply that must be maintained for the protection of coastal resources or public recreational use, the construction of any specified major water using development not essential to residential use including but not limited to swimming pools, or the construction or extension of any landscaping irrigation system;

        g.     Any addition to a single-family residence where the development permit issued for the original structure by the Commission or Regional Commission indicated that any future additions would require a development permit;

        h.     The expansion or construction of any septic systems or domestic water wells;

        i.      Any improvement to structure which changes the intensity of the use of the structure;

        j.      Any improvement made pursuant to a conversion of an existing structure from a multiple unit rental use or visitor-serving commercial use to a use involving a fee ownership or long-term leasehold including but not limited to a condominium conversion, stock cooperative conversion or motel/hotel time-sharing conversion.

        3.     Maintenance dredging of more that one hundred thousand cubic yards of material within a twelve month period of existing navigation channels or moving dredged material from such channels to a disposal area outside the coastal zone, pursuant to a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        4.     Repair or maintenance activities that result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of, the object of such repair, or certain extraordinary methods of repair and maintenance that involve a risk of substantial adverse environmental impact, they shall require that a permit be obtained under this chapter.

        a.     The following extraordinary methods of repair and maintenance shall require a coastal development permit because they involve a risk of substantial adverse environmental impact. Any method of repair or maintenance of a seawall revetment, bluff retaining wall, breakwater, groin or similar shoreline work that involves:

        i.      Any repair or maintenance to facilities or structures or work located in an environmentally sensitive habitat area, any sand area, within fifty feet of the edge of a coastal bluff or environmentally sensitive habitat area, or within twenty feet of coastal waters or streams that include:

        (a)    The placement or removal, whether temporary or permanent, of rip-rap, rocks, sand or other beach materials or any other forms of solid materials;

        (b)    The presence, whether temporary or permanent, of mechanized equipment or construction materials.

        ii.     Repair or maintenance involving substantial alteration of the foundation of the protective work including pilings and other surface or subsurface structures;

        iii.    The placement, whether temporary or permanent, of rip-rap, artificial berms of sand or other beach materials, or any other forms of solid materials, on a beach or in coastal waters, streams, wetlands, estuaries and lakes or on a shoreline protective work;

        iv.    The replacement of twenty percent or more of the materials of an existing structure with materials of a different kind; or

        v.     The presence, whether temporary or permanent, of mechanized construction equipment or construction materials on any sand area or bluff or within twenty feet of coastal waters or streams.

        b.     Repair and maintenance activities described in the Commission’s September 5, 1978 document which have a risk of substantial adverse impact on public access, ESHA, public views or wetlands.

        c.     Unless destroyed by natural disaster, the replacement of fifty percent of more of a seawall, revetment, bluff retaining wall, breakwater, groin or similar protective work under one ownership is not repair and maintenance but instead constitutes a replacement structure requiring a coastal development permit.

        d.     Notwithstanding the above provisions, the executive director of the coastal commission shall have the discretion to exempt from this section ongoing routine repair and maintenance activities of local governments, state agencies, and public utilities (such as railroads) involving shoreline works protecting transportation roadways.

        e.     Pursuant to this section, the planning commission may issue a permit for on-going maintenance activities for a term in excess of the one-year term provided by this title. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.015 Temporary events.
        A.    Except as provided in sub-sections B and C, below, the planning director shall exclude from coastal development permit requirements all temporary events except those which meet all of the following criteria:

        1.     Are held between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day; and

        2.     Occupy all or a portion of a sandy beach area; and

        3.     Involve a charge for general public admission or seating where no fee is currently charged for use of the same area (not including booth or entry fees).

        B.     Only temporary events meeting all of the above criteria shall require coastal development permit review, however, the planning director may also exclude from permit requirements temporary events meeting all of the above criteria when:

        1.     The fee is for preferred seating only and more than seventy-five percent of the provided seating capacity is available free of charge for general public use; or

        2.     The event is held on sandy beach area in a remote location with minimal demand for public use, and there is no potential for adverse effect on sensitive coastal resources; or

        3.     The event is less than one day in duration; or

        4.     The event has previously received a coastal development permit and will be held in the same location, at a similar season, and for the same duration, with operating and environmental conditions substantially the same as those associated with the previously-approved event.

        C.     Planning director discretion to require a permit. The planning director may determine that a temporary event shall be subject to coastal development permit review, even if the criteria in Section A are not met. If the planning director determines that unique or changing circumstances exist relative to a particular temporary event that have the potential for significant adverse impacts on coastal resources. Such circumstances may include the following:

        1.     The event, either individually or together with other temporary events scheduled before or after the particular event, precludes the general public from use of a public recreational area for a significant period of time.

        2.     The event and its associated activities or access requirements will either directly or indirectly impact environmentally sensitive habitat areas, rare or endangered species, significant scenic resources, or other coastal resources as defined in Chapter 17.61.

        3.     The event is scheduled between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day and would restrict public use of roadways or parking areas or otherwise significantly impact public use or access to coastal waters;

        4.     The event has historically required a coastal development permit to address and monitor associated impacts to coastal resources.

        D.    Effect on other permit requirements. Exemption from coastal development permit requirements is not to be construed as exemption from permits and/ or entitlements required by the city. Where a building permit, use permit, variance, land subdivision, etc., is required by the city for development which is exempt under the provisions of subsection A of this section, the entitlement shall be processed pursuant to the city regulations for non-coastal zone areas.

        E.     Record of Permit Exemption. The planning director shall maintain a record of all those developments within the coastal zone that have been authorized as being exempt from the requirement for a coastal development permit pursuant to this chapter. This record shall be available for review by members of the public and mailed to the North Coast District Office of the California Coastal Commission. The record of exemption shall include the name of the applicant, the location of the project, and a brief description of the project. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.016 Emergency permits.
        It is recognized that in some instances a person or public agency performing a public service may need to undertake work to protect life and public property, or to maintain public services before the provisions of Title 17 can be fully complied with. Where such persons or agencies are authorized to proceed without a permit pursuant to the general requirements of this chapter, they shall comply with the requirements of Title 17 to the maximum extent feasible.

        A.    Applications in cases of emergencies shall be made to the planning director by letter if time allows, and by telephone or in person if time does not allow.

        B.     The information to be reported during the emergency, if it is possible to do so, or to be reported fully in any case after the emergency shall include the following:

        1.     The nature of the emergency;

        2.     The cause of the emergency, insofar as this can be established;

        3.     The location of the emergency;

        4.     The remedial, protective, or preventive work required to deal with the emergency;

        5.     The circumstances during the emergency that appeared to justify the course(s) of action taken, including the probable consequences of failing to take action.

        C.     The planning director shall verify the facts, including the existence and nature of the emergency, insofar as time allows.

        D.    1.     The planning director shall provide public notice of the proposed emergency action with the extent and type of notice determined on the basis of the nature of the emergency itself. Notice shall also be provided to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission.

        2.     The planning director may grant an emergency permit upon reasonable terms and conditions, including an expiration date, if he finds that:

        a.     An emergency exists and requires action more quickly than permitted by the procedures for ordinary permits;

        b.     Public comment on the proposed emergency action has been reviewed if time allows;

        c.     The work proposed would be consistent with the requirements of the certified Local Coastal Program.

        3.     The planning director shall report in writing to each meeting of the planning commission the emergency permits applied for or issued since the last report, with a description of the nature of the emergency and the work involved. Copies of this report shall be available at the meeting and shall have been mailed at the time that application summaries and staff recommendations are normally distributed to all persons who have requested such notification in writing.

        All emergency permits issued after the mailing for the meeting shall be briefly described by the planning director at the meeting and the written report shall be distributed prior to the next succeeding meeting.

        4.     Within ten calendar days of request for an emergency permit the owner/applicant shall submit an application for any required local entitlement pursuant to Section 17.84.020. Where findings are made that the action is not in conformity with the long-term policies of the Coastal Land Use Plan, the application shall be denied and the emergency permit revoked. Such revocation shall specify the type of abatement action required, if any, and a time limit for compliance shall be specified. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.020 Application processing and review procedures.
        A.    When a proposed development, as defined herein, is located in the coastal zone a coastal development permit shall be required in addition to any other approval or permit required in these regulations.

        B.     Procedures for applying for a coastal development permit are as follows:

        1.     Application contents. Each application for a permit, amendment, or other matter pertaining to this Title shall be filed with the planning director on an application form approved by the city council together with required fees and/or deposits, and all other information and materials required by the city’s list of required application contents, as identified in the community development department handout for the specific type of application. Applicants are encouraged to contact the department before submitting an application to verify which materials are necessary for application filing.

        2.     Identification of interested persons; submission of envelopes, posting of site. For applications filed pursuant to this chapter, the applicant shall provide names and addresses of, and stamped envelopes for adjacent landowners and residents, and other interested persons as provided in this section. The applicant shall provide the commission with a list of:

        a.     The addresses of all residences, including each residence within an apartment or condominium complex, located within one hundred feet (not including roads) of the perimeter of the parcel of real property of record on which the development is proposed;

        b.     The addresses of all owners of parcels of real property of record located within one hundred feet (not including roads) of the perimeter of the parcel of real property of record on which the development is proposed, based upon the most recent equalized assessment roll; and,

        c.     The names and addresses of all persons known to the applicant to be interested in the application, including those persons who testified at or submitted written comments for the local hearing(s).

        This list shall be part of the public record maintained by the department for the application.

        3.     The applicant shall also provide the department with stamped envelopes for all addresses on the list prepared pursuant to subsection 1.a through 1.c above. Separate stamped envelopes shall be addressed to “owner,” “occupant,” or the name of the interested person, as applicable. The applicant shall also place a legend on the front of each envelope including words to the effect of “Important. Public Hearing Notice.” The director shall provide an appropriate stamp for the use of applicants in the commission office. The legend shall be legible and of sufficient size to be reasonably noted by the recipient of the envelope. The director may waive this requirement for addresses identified under subsection 1.a and 1.b above and may require that some other suitable form of notice be provided by the applicant to those interested persons pursuant to these regulations.

        4.     If at the applicant’s request, the public hearing on the application is postponed or continued after notice of the hearing has been mailed, the applicant shall provide an additional set of stamped, addressed envelopes that meet the requirements of this section. The additional set of stamped, addressed envelopes shall be submitted within ten days of the commission’s or council’s decision to postpone or continue the hearing.

        5.     At the time the application is submitted for filing, the applicant must post, at a conspicuous place, easily read by the public which is also as close as possible to the site of the proposed development, notice that an application for a permit for the proposed development has been submitted to the commission. Such notice shall contain a general description of the nature of the proposed development. The department shall furnish the applicant with a standardized form to be used for such posting. If the applicant fails to sign the declaration of posting, the director shall refuse to file the application.

        6.     The planning commission or council may revoke a permit if it determines that the permit was granted without proper notice having been given.

        C.     Eligibility for filing. An application may only be filed by the owner of the subject property, or other person with the written consent of the property owner. With the director’s approval, a lessee with the exclusive right to use the property for a specified use may file an application related to that use.

        D.    Rejection of application. If the director determines that an application cannot lawfully be approved by the city (e.g., a request for use that could not be granted in the absence of a preceding a coastal land use plan or coastal zoning text or map amendment, or a concurrent tentative subdivision map approval; or a use permit application proposing a use that is not allowable in the subject zoning district, etc.), the director shall not accept the application for processing.

        E.     Fee schedule. In addition to the fees imposed pursuant to Section 17.61.030, the council shall establish a schedule of fees for the processing of the applications required intended to allow recovery of all costs incurred by the city in processing permit applications to the maximum extent allowed by the law.

        F.     Review for completeness. The director shall review each application for completeness and accuracy before it is accepted as being complete and officially filed. The director’s determination of completeness shall be based on the city’s list of required application contents (see Chapters 17.84A through 17.84G “Coastal development permit application contents” sub-sections), and any additional written instructions provided to the applicant in any pre-application conference, and/or during the initial application review period.

As required by State law (Government Code Section 65943), within thirty calendar days of application filing, the applicant shall be informed in writing, either that the application is complete and has been accepted for processing, or that the application is incomplete and that additional information, specified in the director’s letter, shall be provided.

        H.    Appeal of determination. Where the director has determined that an application is incomplete, and the applicant believes that the application is complete and/or that the information requested by the director is not required, the applicant may appeal the director’s determination in compliance with Section 17.84.040.

        I.      Environmental information. Prior to an application having been accepted as complete for filing, the director may request the applicant to submit additional information needed for the environmental review of the project in compliance with Chapters 17.84A through 17.84G.

        J.      Referral of application. At the discretion of the director, or where otherwise required by this title or state or federal law, an application may be referred to any public agency that may be affected by or have an interest in the proposed project.

        K.    Staff evaluation. The director shall review all discretionary applications filed in compliance with this title to determine whether they comply and are consistent with the provisions of this title, other applicable provisions of the city code, the coastal land use plan, and any applicable specific plan.

        L.     Staff report. The director shall provide a written recommendation to the commission and/or council (as applicable) as to whether the application should be approved, approved subject to conditions, or disapproved.

        M.    Finding. A coastal development permit may be granted if the facts presented are such that the development is in conformity with the certified coastal element of the general plan. Each coastal development permit issued for any development as indicated on the coastal appeals area map shall include specific factually-based findings, as further set forth in Section 17.84.033 and in Chapters 17.84A through 17.84G, sub-sections.040—Supplemental Findings, substantiating how such development does so conform.

17.84.025 Determination of applicable notice and hearing procedures.
        The determination of whether a development is categorically excluded, non-appealable or appealable for purposes of notice, hearing and appeals procedures shall be made by the planning director at the time the application for development within the coastal zone is submitted. This determination shall be made with reference to the city’s certified local coastal program, including any maps, categorical exclusions, land use designations and zoning ordinances which are adopted as part of the local coastal program. Where an applicant, interested person, or the city has a question as to the appropriate designation for the development, the following procedures shall establish whether a development is categorically excluded, non-appealable or appealable:

        A.    The planning director shall make his or her determination as to what type of development is being proposed (i.e. categorically excluded, appealable, non-appealable) and shall inform the applicant of the notice and hearing requirements for that particular development.

        B.     If the determination of the planning director, or the planning commission and/or the city council on appeal, is challenged by the applicant or an interested person, or if the city wishes to have a Commission determination as to the appropriate designation, the city shall notify the Commission by telephone of the dispute/question and shall request an executive director’s opinion;

        C.     The executive director shall, within two working days of the city’s request (or upon completion of a site inspection where such inspection is warranted), transmit his or her determination as to whether the development is categorically excluded, non-appealable or appealable;

        D.    Where, after the executive director’s investigation, the executive director’s determination is not in accordance with the city’s determination, the coastal commission shall hold a hearing for purposes of determining the appropriate designation for the area. The Coastal Commission shall schedule the hearing on the determination for the next Coastal Commission meeting (in the appropriate geographic region of the state) following the local government request.

The City Council may elect to waive such fee and apply to the state’s Coastal Commission for a reimbursement of that fee through an SB90 claim or similar reimbursement process. Further, should the City Council not elect to waive the appeal fee, the appellant may appeal directly to the state’s Coastal Commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.031 Procedures and notices for non-appealable developments.
        A.    The notice requirements for developments where a public hearing is required under this title, but which are not appealable pursuant to Section 17.84.030.A, and which are not categorically excluded, are as follows.

17.84.032 Hearings.
        A.    Public hearing on appealable developments. At least one public hearing shall be held on each application for an appealable development, thereby affording any persons the opportunity to appear at the hearing and inform the local government of the nature of their concerns regarding the project. Such hearing shall occur no earlier than seven calendar days following the mailing of the notice required in Section 17.84.031.A. The public hearing may be conducted in accordance with existing city procedures or in any other manner reasonably calculated to give interested persons an opportunity to appear and present their viewpoints, either orally or in writing.

        B.     Second residential units which meet the criteria specified in Section 17.83.010.A do not require a public hearing pursuant to Government Code Section 65852.2.

        C.     New permit applications which are, in the opinion of the planning director, de minimis with respect to the purposes and objectives of the adopted Local Coastal Program and which do not involve appealable development, may be scheduled for one public planning commission hearing during which all such items will be taken up as a single matter, which shall be known as the consent calendar, pursuant to the following criteria:

        1.     Applications shall be processed pursuant to applicable regulations including any preparation of staff reports and the recommendation of findings and/or conditions. Where an item is approved as a part of the consent calendar, any such recommendations shall also be deemed approved.

Any person may request that a consent calendar item be removed and heard as a separate item subject to their submittal of a brief statement of reasons for the request. The Commission shall, upon a majority vote in favor of the request, set a continued hearing time for the subject item.

        3.     For the purposes of this section a proposed development is de minimis if it involves no potential for any adverse effect, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources and that it will be consistent with the city’s certified local coastal program.

        D.    All permit applications involving appealable development and other permit applications not so determined to be de minimis shall be heard as a separate hearing item. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.033 Required findings.
        Approval of any coastal development permit shall be based upon specific factual findings supporting the conclusion that: (1) the proposed development, without or without conditions, is consistent with the policies and standards of the City’s certified local coastal program, and, for development located within the first public road and the sea the access and recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act; and (2) there are no other feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that would lessen any significant adverse effects of the development or the environment. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.034 Permit conditions.
        Any permit that is issued or any development or action approved on appeal, pursuant to this chapter, shall be subject to reasonable terms and conditions in order to ensure that such development or action will be in accordance with the provisions of this title. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        A.    The executive director of the Coastal Commission shall review and approve all legal documents specified in the conditions of approval of a coastal development permit for public access and conservation/open space easements.

        1.     Upon completion of permit review by the city and prior to the issuance of the permit, the city shall forward a copy of the permit conditions and findings of approval and copies of the legal documents to the executive director of the Coastal Commission for review and approval of the legal adequacy and consistency with the requirements of potential accepting agencies;

        2.     The executive director of the Coastal Commission shall have fifteen working days from receipt of the documents in which to complete the review and notify the applicant of recommended revisions if any;

        3.     The city may issue the permit upon expiration of the fifteen working day period if notification of inadequacy has not been received by the local government within that time period;

        4.     If the executive director has recommended revisions to the applicant, the permit shall not be issued until the deficiencies have been resolved to the satisfaction of the executive director; or

        B.     The city may request the Coastal Commission to delegate the authority to process the recordation of the necessary legal documents to the city. The Coastal Commission shall delegate said authority provided the city identifies the department of the local government or public agency or private association that has the resources and authorization to accept, open and operate and maintain the accessways and open space/conservation areas required as a condition of approval of coastal development permits. Upon completion of the recordation of the documents, the city shall forward a copy of the permit conditions and findings of approval and copies of the legal documents pertaining to the public access and open space conditions to the executive director of the Coastal Commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.036 Consolidated coastal development permit applications.
        A.    Notwithstanding Public Resources Section 30519, the coastal commission may process and act upon a consolidated coastal development permit application if both of the following criteria are satisfied.

        1.     A proposed project requires a coastal development permit from both a local government with a certified local coastal program and the coastal commission.

        2.     The applicant, the appropriate local government, and the commission, which may agree through its executive director, consent to consolidate the permit action, provided that public participation is not substantially impaired by that review consolidation.

        B.     The standard of review for a consolidated coastal development permit application submitted pursuant to subdivision A. shall follow Chapter 3 of the California Coastal Act (commencing with Public Resources Code Section 30200), with the appropriate local coastal program used as guidance.

        C.     The application fee for consolidated coastal development permit shall be determined by reference to the coastal commission’s permit fee schedule. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.037 Completion of decision; notice of final local action; finality of city action.
        A.    Completion of city action. The city’s decision on an application for a development shall not be deemed complete until: (1) the local decision on the application has been made and all required findings have been adopted, including specific factual findings supporting the legal conclusions that the proposed development is or is not in conformity with the certified local coastal program and, where applicable, with the public access and recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act; and (2) when all local rights of appeal have been exhausted as defined in Section 17.84.040.B.2.

        B.     Notice of final local action. Within seven calendar days of the city completing its review and meeting the requirements of Section 17.84.032, the city shall notify by first class mail the Coastal Commission and any persons who specifically requested notice of such action by submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the local government (or, where required, who paid a reasonable fee to receive such notice) of its action. Such notice shall include conditions of approval and written findings and the procedures for appeal of the local decision to the Coastal Commission.

        C.     Failure to act—Notice.

        1.     Notification by applicant. If a local government has failed to act on an application within the time limits set forth in Government Code Sections 65950-65957.1, the person claiming a right to proceed pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950-65957.1 shall notify, in writing, the city and the Coastal Commission of his or her claim that the development has been approved by operation of law. Such notice shall specify the application which is claimed to be approved.

        2.     Notification by city. If the city determines that the time limits established pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950-65957.1 have expired, the local government shall, within seven calendar days of such determination, notify any person entitled to receive notice pursuant to Section 13571(a) that the application has been approved by operation of law pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950-65957.1 and the application may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to Section 17.84.040.B or 17.84.040.C. This section shall apply equally to a local government determination that the project has been approved by operation of law and to a judicial determination that the project has been approved by operation of law.

        D.    A local government’s final decision on an application for an appealable development shall become effective after the ten working day appeal period to the Commission has expired unless either of the following occur:

        1.     An appeal is filed in accordance with Section 17.84.040; or

        2.     The notice of final local government action does not meet the requirements of sub-section B;

        When either of these circumstances occur, the Coastal Commission shall, within five calendar days of receiving notice of that circumstance, notify the local government and the applicant that the effective date of the local government action has been suspended. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84.040 Appeals.
        In the case of any coastal development permit, use permit or variance, and in the case of any order, requirement, decision or other determination made by the planning director, the procedures for appeals shall be described in this section.

        A.    Administrative Actions Appealable. Any person aggrieved by any determination, interpretation, decision, decree, judgment, or similar action taken by the planning director under the provisions of the coastal zone zoning ordinance, may appeal such action to the planning commission.

        B.     Planning Commission Action Appealable. Action, or appellate determinations of the planning commission, may be appealed to the city council. Alternately, if the city imposes a fee to appeal an action of the planning commission on a coastal development permit to the city council, the planning commission’s approval of a coastal development permit for development other than a major public works project or major energy facility, or the approval or denial of a coastal development permit for a major public works project or a major energy facility, the action may be appealed directly to the coastal commission.

        C.     City Council Action Appealable. Approved actions, or approved appellate determinations of the city council, may be appealed to the Coastal Commission under the following circumstances:

        1.     Eligible Appellants. An appeal may be filed by an applicant, any aggrieved person, as defined herein, or any two members of the Coastal Commission.

        2.     Exhaustion of Appeals. An appellant other than any coastal commissioners who have appealed, shall exhaust all local appeals before becoming eligible to appeal to the Coastal Commission, except if one of the following conditions prevail:

        a.     The local government or jurisdiction requires an appellant to appeal to more local appellate bodies than have been certified as appellate bodies for permits in the coastal zone, in the implementation section of the local coastal program.

        b.     An appellant was denied the right of the initial local appeal by a local ordinance which restricts the class of persons who may appeal a local decision.

        c.     An appellant was denied the right of local appeal because local notice and hearing procedures for the development did not comply with the provisions of these regulations.

        d.     The local government jurisdiction charges a fee for the filing or processing of appeals, in which case the local government may elect to waive the appeal fee and apply to the Commission for a reimbursement of that fee through an SB90 claim or similar reimbursement process. Any such waiver of appeal fees shall be granted prior to the transmittal of the notice of final local action to the coastal commission.

        3.     Grounds for Appeal.

        a.     The grounds for an appeal to the types of development enumerated in Section 17.84.030.A. shall be limited to one or more of the following allegations:

        i.      For development approved by the city located between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within three hundred feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tide line of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance, the development does not conform to the certified local coastal program and/or the access and recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act;

        ii.     For development approved by the city not included within subsection i. of this section that are located on tidelands, submerged lands, public trust lands, within one hundred feet of any wetland, estuary, stream, or within three hundred feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff, the development does not conform to the certified local coastal program;

        iii.    For development approved by the city not included within sub-section i. or ii. of this section that are located in a sensitive coastal resource area, the development does not conform to the certified local coastal program;

        For development approved or denied by the city which constitutes a major public works project of a major energy facility, the development does not conform to the certified local coastal program; shall become final after the tenth working day, unless an appeal in writing is filed within that time.

        D.    Appeal Procedures.

        1.     Filing Requirements for appeals to city appellate bodies. Appeals shall be addressed to the appellate body, on a prescribed form and shall state the basis of the appeal. Appeals shall be filed with the city within ten days following the date of the action from which an appeal is taken. Appeals shall be accompanied by a filing fee or a request to waive such fee. Planning commission or City Council actions that may be appealed to the Coastal Commission shall be filed with the Coastal Commission and the appeal period shall run for ten working days after receipt by the Coastal Commission of the city’s final action.

        2.     Stay of Proceedings. An action of the planning commission so appealed from shall not become effective unless and until approved by the City Council in accordance with this section.

        3.     Notice of Hearings. The notice and conduct of hearings by the appellate body shall be governed by the provisions of Section 17.84.030 and shall conform to the manner in which the original notice was given and the original hearings were conducted.

        4.     Time Limitation and Vote. The planning commission shall determine an appeal not later than its second regular meeting following the date on which the appeal was filed in its office. The action from which an appeal is taken may be reversed or modified only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized membership of said commission. The City Council shall determine an appeal no later than the fourth regular meeting following the date on which the appeal was filed in its office. The action, or appellate determination, from which an appeal is taken may be reversed or modified only upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized membership of said council.

        5.     Failure of Appellate Body to Act. Failure of the appellate body to act within the time specified shall be deemed concurrence with the previous decision rendered.

        6.     Exhaustion of Remedy. All rights of appeal are exhausted when the proceedings set forth herein have been consummated.

        7.     Conditions and Findings. The appellate body may impose or prescribe conditions in its resolution that are in its opinion necessary to serve the objectives of this chapter. The appellate body shall make a written determination of its decision together with its findings in support of the decision. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        The provisions of this chapter apply to all development and proposed land uses located within the Coastal Zone. Certain sections of this chapter (i.e., access dedications) apply only to areas between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea as defined in Chapter 17.61. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.030 Definitions.
        A.    Definitions of terms used in this chapter:

        1.     Development. “Development” means, on land, in or under water, the placement or erection of a solid material or structure; discharge or disposal of any dredged material or of any gaseous, liquid, solid, or thermal waste; change in density or intensity of use of land, including but not limited to, subdivision pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act (commencing with Section 66410 of the Government Code), and any other division of land, including lot splits, except where the land division is brought about in connection with the purchase of such land by a public agency for public recreational use; change in the intensity of use of water; or access thereto; construction, reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the size of any structure, including any facility of any private or public or municipal utility; and the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than for agricultural purposes; kelp harvesting, and timber operations which are in accordance with a timber harvesting plan submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Z’berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (commencing with Section 4511). As used in this section structure includes, but is not limited to, any building, road, pipe, flume, conduit, siphon, aqueduct, telephone line, and electrical power transmission and distribution line.

        2.     New Development. For purposes of implementing the public access requirements of Public Resources Code Section 30212 and of this Section, “new development” includes “development” as defined above except for the following:

        a.     Structures destroyed by natural disaster: The replacement of any structure, other than a public works facility, destroyed by a disaster; provided that the replacement structure conforms to applicable existing zoning requirements, is for the same use as the destroyed structure, does not exceed either the floor area, height, or bulk of the destroyed structure by more than ten percent, is sited in the same location on the affected property as the destroyed structure and does not extend the replacement structure seaward on a sandy beach or beach fronting bluff lot. As used in this section, “disaster” means any situation in which the force or forces which destroyed the structure be replaced were beyond the control of the owners

        b.     Demolition and reconstruction: The demolition and reconstruction of a single-family residence; provided that the reconstructed residence shall not exceed either the floor area, height or bulk of the former structure by more than ten percent, that the reconstructed residence shall be sited in the same location on the affected property as the former structure, that the reconstructed residence does not block or impede public access, that the reconstructed residence does not extend seaward of the demolished residence on a sandy beach or beach fronting bluff lot and that the reconstructed residence does not include or necessitate a shoreline protective device.

        c.     Improvements: Improvements to any structure which do not change the intensity of its use, which do not increase either the floor area, height or bulk of the structure by more than ten percent, which do not block or impede access, which do not result in a seaward encroachment by the structure and which do not include or necessitate a new or enlarged shoreline protective device.

        d.     Repair and maintenance: Repair or maintenance activity which, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 30610(d) and California Code of Regulations Section 13252, requires no permit unless the activity will have an adverse impact on lateral public access along the beach.

        e.     Reconstruction and/or repair of a seawall, revetment, retaining wall or other shoreline protective device: The reconstruction or repair of any shoreline protective device; provided that the reconstructed or repaired shoreline protective device does not substantially alter the foundation of the protective device, does not result in the replacement of twenty percent or more of the materials of the existing structure with materials of a different kind, does not extend the protective device seaward of the location of the former structure. As used in this section, “reconstruction or repair” of a seawall shall not include replacement by a different type of structure or other modification in design or construction which results in different or greater impacts to public access or other shoreline resources than those of the existing structure.

        3.     Sea. “Sea” means the Pacific Ocean and all harbors, bays, channels, estuaries, salt marshes, sloughs, and other areas subject to tidal action through any connection with the Pacific Ocean, excluding non estuarine rivers, streams, tributaries, creeks and flood control and drainage channels.

        B.     Types of public access.

        1.     Vertical access: Provides public access from the first public road, trail, or public use area nearest the sea to the publicly owned shoreline, tidelands, or established lateral access perpendicular to the shore.

        2.     Lateral access: Provides for public access and use along or parallel to the shoreline.

        3.     Blufftop access: Provides access and coastal viewing along blufftops that run parallel to the shoreline, and in some cases provide the only opportunity for public access along the shoreline above a rocky intertidal zone with no sandy beach.

        4.     Trail access: Provides public access (i.e. hiking, biking, and equestrian) along a coastal or mountain recreational path, including to and along canyons, rivers, streams, wetlands, lagoons, freshwater marshes, significant habitat and open space areas or similar resource areas, and which also may link inland trails or recreational facilities to the shoreline.

        5.     Recreational access: Provides public access to coastal recreational resources through means other than those listed above, including but not limited to, parking facilities, viewing platforms, and blufftop parks.

        C.     Character of accessway use.

        1.     “Pass and repass” refers to the right of the public to walk and run along an accessway. Because this use limitation can substantially restrict the public’s ability to enjoy adjacent publicly owned tidelands by restricting the potential use of lateral accessways, it will be applied only in connection with vertical access or other types of access where the findings required by Section 17.84A.090 of this chapter establish that the limitation is necessary to protect natural habitat values, topographic features (such as eroding bluffs), or privacy of the landowner.

        2.     Passive recreational use refers to those recreational activities typically associated with coastal open space that generally are non-structured and require minimal or no developed facilities or improvements to land. Such activities include, but are not limited to, walking, biking, jogging, hiking, dog walking, bird watching, tide-pooling, beach combing, informal sports activities such as Frisbee or ball throwing and kite-flying, nature viewing, and picnicking. Passive recreation includes ancillary facilities necessary to support visitor access to the coastal open space, including but not limited to parking lots, interpretive signage, visitor kiosks, restrooms, etc. Passive recreation activities do not include activities such as: playgrounds, community gardens, ball-fields, skate parks, etc.

        3.     Active recreational use refers to the right of the public to conduct the full range of beach-oriented activities, not including horseback riding and use of motorized vehicles unless specifically authorized. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.040 General provisions.
        A.    Protection of existing coastal access. Development shall not interfere with public rights of access to the sea where the rights were acquired through use or legislative authorization. Public access rights may include but are not limited to the use of dry sand and rocky beaches to the first line of terrestrial vegetation.

        B.     Access requirements. Proposed development and new land uses located between the ocean the first public road may be required to provide vertical (perpendicular) access from the public road to bluff and beach areas, and lateral access along the beach, shoreline and blufftops, where the review authority first makes specific findings documenting the need for additional public access on and/or through the site, and the relationship of the required dedication to the impacts on existing access, or needs for additional access created by the project.

        C.     Exceptions to access requirements. Coastal access requirements may be waived by the review authority based upon specific findings that the provision of public access would be inappropriate because:

        1.     It would be inconsistent with public safety, or the protection of fragile coastal resources;

        2.     Adequate access exists within one-fourth-mile of the site;

        3.     Access at the site would be inconsistent with the policies of the coastal land use plan other than those requiring access; or

        4.     Requiring or providing the access would be inconsistent with federal or state law.

        D.    Timing of access implementation. The type and extent of access to be dedicated, and/or constructed and maintained, as well as the method by which its continuing availability for public use is to be guaranteed, shall be established at the time of land use permit approval, as provided by this section.

        1.     Dedication. Shall occur before issuance of construction permits and before the start of any construction activity not requiring a permit.

        2.     Construction of improvements: Shall occur at the same time as construction of the approved development, unless another time is established through conditions of land use permit approval.

        3.     Interference with public use prohibited. Following an offer to dedicate public access in compliance with to this section; the property owner shall not interfere with use by the public of the areas subject to the offer before and after acceptance by the responsible entity. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.050 Access location—Requirements.
        Vertical, lateral, and/or blufftop access shall be required by the review authority in compliance with this chapter, in the locations specified by the Open Space, Conservation, and Parks Element of the Coastal General Plan.

        A.    Access required. As a condition of approval and prior to issuance of a permit or other authorization for any new development identified in 1.—4. of this section, except as provided in Section 17.84A.030 of this chapter, a twenty-five-foot-wide vertical easement and/or a lateral easement extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation, for one or more of the types of access identified in Section 17.84A.030(B) of this chapter shall be required and shall be supported by findings required by Section 17.84A.090 of this chapter; provided that no such condition of approval shall be imposed if the analysis required by Section 17.84A.090 of this chapter establishes that the development will not adversely affect, either individually or cumulatively, the ability of the public to reach and use public tidelands and coastal resources or that the access dedication requirement will not alleviate the access burdens identified. For any project where such mitigation is required, the preferred implementation shall be through a recorded grant of easement to the city, other government agency, or to a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the city and the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission, who is willing to accept the easement and willing to open, operate, and maintain the public accessway or trail. Where grants of easement are not feasible because neither the city, other government agency, nor private nonprofit association is willing to accept, maintain and operate the accessway, implementation of required access mitigation shall be implemented through a recorded Offer to Dedicate (OTD) an easement to a public agency or a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission.

        1.     New development on any parcel or location specifically identified in the Land Use Plan or in the LCP zoning districts as appropriate for or containing a historically used or suitable public access trail or pathway.

        2.     New development between the nearest public roadway and the sea.

        3.     New development on any site where there is substantial evidence of a public right of access to or along the sea or public tidelands, a blufftop trail or an inland trail acquired through use or a public right of access through legislative authorization.

        4.     New development on any site where a trail, bluff top access or other recreational access is necessary to mitigate impacts of the development on public access where there is no feasible, less environmentally damaging, project alternative that would avoid impacts to public access.

        B.     Protection of existing coastal access. Development shall not interfere with public rights of access to the sea where the rights were acquired through use or legislative authorization. Public access rights may include but are not limited to the use of dry sand and rocky beaches to the first line of terrestrial vegetation.

        C.     Exceptions to access requirements. Coastal access requirements may be waived by the review authority based upon specific findings that the provision of public access would be inappropriate because:

        1.     It would be inconsistent with public safety, military security needs, or the protection of fragile coastal resources;

        2.     Adequate access exists within one-fourth-mile of the site;

        3.     Access at the site would be inconsistent with policies of the Coastal Land Use Plan other than those requiring access;

        4.     Requiring or providing the access would be inconsistent with Federal or State law. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.060 Access design standards.
        The standards of this section are intended to provide guidance to the review authority in determining the appropriate design of accessways to be required by coastal development permit conditions of approval, in compliance with this chapter.

        A.    Design objectives. The following are general guidelines as to the size and nature of all public access facilities in the city.

        1.     Design and siting. Accessways and trails should be sited and designed:

        a.     To minimize alteration of natural landforms, conform to the existing contours of the land, and to subordinate to the character of their setting;

        b.     To prevent unwarranted hazards to the land and public safety;

        c.     To provide for the privacy of adjoining residences and to minimize conflicts with adjacent or nearby established uses; and

        d.     To prevent damage to sensitive coastal resource areas.

        2.     Correction of existing damage/alternative routes. Where appropriate, coastal accessways should be designed to correct damage resulting from past and existing use. Shoreline and blufftop trail segments that may not be passable at all times shall provide inland alternative routes.

        3.     Accessway specifications.

        a.     Width. Each public access easement offered for dedication for public use shall be a minimum of twenty-five feet wide for vertical easements and extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation, for lateral easements. The area where public access is allowed within an easement may be reduced to the minimum necessary for pedestrian traffic to avoid:

        i.      Adverse impacts on sensitive environmental areas;

        ii.     Encroachment closer than twenty feet to an existing residence; and/or

        iii.    Hazardous topographic conditions.

        b.     Slope. The preferred slope gradient for the walking surface of an accessway is zero to twenty percent, and in no case should exceed seventy percent.

        c.     Overhead clearance. The minimum overheard clearance for an accessway shall be seven feet.

        4.     Access for disabled persons. Wherever possible, wheelchair access to the ocean shall be provided. Ramps should have dimensions and gradients consistent with current ADA requirements.

        5.     Residential privacy. The design and placement of access trails should provide for the privacy of adjacent residences. Accessways may be wide enough to allow the placement of a trail, fencing and a landscape buffer.

        6.     Parking. Where access sites are required, parking should be provided where feasible. Where handicapped beach access is provided, one out of five parking spaces should be provided for disabled persons. These spaces should be marked clearly for handicapped use only.

        7.     Signs. Directional signing advising the public of vertical, lateral, and blufftop accessways and parking should be placed in prominent locations along access routes, at appropriate places in the downtown and at major visitor destinations. Signs designating handicapped access points and parking should be conspicuous. Potential hazards along accessways such as steep cliffs, steps or slopes should be signed, and fenced when necessary.

        B.     Standards for application of access conditions. The public access required pursuant to Section 17.84A.050(A) of this chapter shall conform to the following standards and requirements, as applicable to the type of access facility.

        1.     Vertical access. A vertical accessway shall comply with the following standards, in addition to the other applicable requirements of this section.

        a.     Minimum requirements. A condition to require vertical public access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to Section 17.84A.050(A) of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of access, (1) located in specific locations identified in the certified local coastal program for future vertical access, or (2) located in a site for which the city has reviewed an application for a development permit and has determined a vertical accessway is required pursuant to the access and recreation policies of the Coastal Act or the applicable provisions of the City of Crescent City Local Coastal Program.

        b.     A condition to require vertical access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to Section 17.84A.050(A) of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of vertical access and be limited to the public right of passive recreational use unless another character of use is specified as a condition of the development. In determining whether another character of use is appropriate, findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in Section 17.84A.090(B) of this chapter.

        c.     Each vertical accessway shall extend from the public road to the shoreline (or bluff edge) and shall be legally described as required in Section 17.84A.080(D) of this chapter. The vertical access easement shall be a minimum of twenty-five-feet-wide, and extending along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation for the lateral easement, wherever feasible. If a residential structure is proposed, the accessway should be sited along the border or side property line of the project site or away from existing or proposed development and should not be sited closer than ten feet to the structure wherever feasible. Exceptions to siting a vertical accessway along a border or side property line or not closer than ten feet to a structure may be required where topographical, physical or other constraints exist on the site.

        2.     Lateral access. A lateral accessway shall comply with the following standards, in addition to the other applicable requirements of this section.

        a.     Minimum requirements. A condition to require lateral access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to Section 17.84A.050(A) of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of lateral public access and passive recreational use along the shoreline (or public recreational area, bikeway, or blufftop area, as applicable). Active recreational use may be appropriate in many cases where the development is determined to be especially burdensome on public access. Examples include cases where the burdens of the proposed project would severely impact public recreational use of the shoreline, where the proposed development is not one of the priority uses specified in Public Resources Code Section 30222, where active recreational uses reflect the historic public use of the site, where active recreational uses would be consistent with the use of the proposed project, and where such uses would not significantly interfere with the privacy of the landowner. In determining the appropriate character of public use, findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in Section 17.84A.090.B of this chapter. Lateral access shall be legally described as required in Section 17.84A.080.D. The requirements of this section shall apply for blufftop access or trail access, as applicable.

        3.     Blufftop access.

        a.     Minimum requirements. A condition to require public access to or along a blufftop as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to Section 17.84A.050.A of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of scenic and visual access from the bluff top to the public tidelands.

        b.     The blufftop access shall be limited to passive recreational use and coastal viewing purposes unless another character of use is specified as a condition of development. In determining the appropriate character of use findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in Section 17.84A.090(B) of this chapter.

        c.     Each blufftop accessway shall be described in the conditions of approval of the coastal development permit as an area beginning at the current bluff edge extending twenty-five feet inland or (greater or lesser) as determined to be necessary for public safety or geologic stability. However, wherever feasible, the accessway should not extend any closer than ten feet from an occupied residential structure. Due to the potential for erosion of the bluff edge, the condition shall include a mechanism that will cause the accessway to be adjusted inland as the edge recedes. Any permanent improvements should be set back from the accessway by a distance derived by multiplying the annual rate of blufftop retreat by the one-hundred-year life expectancy of the improvements plus an added geologic stability factor of one and one-half.

        d.     The accessway shall be legally described as required in Section 17.84A.080.D of this chapter, the following manner: “Such easement shall be a minimum of twenty-five feet wide located along the blufftop as measured inland from the daily bluff edge. As the daily bluff top edge may vary and move inland, the location of this right of way will change over time with the then current bluff edge.”

        4.     Trail access.

        a.     Minimum requirements. A condition to require public access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) required pursuant to Section 17.84A.050.A. of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of access and active recreational use, (1) along a designated alignment of a coastal recreational path or trail in specific locations identified in the LCP for implementation of trail access, or (2) in locations where it has been determined that a trail access is required to link recreational areas to the shoreline or provide alternative recreation and access opportunities pursuant to the access and recreation policies of the LCP and Coastal Act, consistent with other provisions of this chapter. In determining if another character of use is appropriate, findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in Section 17.84A.090.B of this chapter.

        The trail access shall be legally described as required by Section 17.84A.080.D of this chapter.

        5.     Recreational access

        a.     Minimum requirements. A condition to require public recreational access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or some other authorization to proceed with development) required pursuant to Section 17.84A.050.A of this chapter shall provide the public with the permanent right of access and use within a designated recreational access area. Conditions required pursuant to this section shall specify the location and extent of the public access area. The form and content should take the form of requirements in Section 17.84A.060.B.1-.5 of this chapter as applicable. The accessway shall be legally described as required in Section 17.84A.080.D of this chapter. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.070 Protection of historic public use.
        A.    Substantial evidence determination. Substantial evidence that the area used by the public has been impliedly dedicated shall be determined based on evidence of all of the following:

        1.     The public must have used the land for a period of five years or more as if it were public land.

        2.     Without asking for or receiving permission from the owner.

        3.     With the actual or presumed knowledge of the owner.

        4.     Without significant objection or bona fide attempts by the owner to prevent or halt the use.

        5.     The use must be substantial, rather than minimal.

        B.     Findings. Where an issue as to the existence of public prescriptive rights has been raised during the course of reviewing a coastal development permit application, one of the following findings shall be made:

        1.     Substantial evidence does not warrant the conclusion that public prescriptive rights exist.

        2.     There is substantial evidence of the existence of public prescriptive rights, but development will not interfere with those rights.

        3.     There is substantial evidence of the existence of public prescriptive rights which requires denial of a coastal development permit because of interference with those rights.

        4.     There is substantial evidence of the existence of public prescriptive rights, but a condition requiring dedication of public access protects the rights of the public and is equivalent in time, place and manner to any prescriptive rights which may exist.

        5.     There is substantial evidence of the existence of public prescriptive rights, but a condition requiring siting development away from the area used by the public protects the rights of the public.

        C.     Siting and design requirements.

        1.     Development shall be sited and designed in a manner that does not interfere with or diminish any public right of access which may exist based on the potential public rights based on substantial evidence of historic public use. Only when site constraints are so severe that siting of the accessway or recreational use area in its historic location would significantly impair the proposed development and alternative development siting is not feasible, development may be sited in the area of public right of access based on historic use provided that the applicant provides an equivalent area of public access or recreation to and along the same destination and including the same type and intensity of public use as previously existed on the site. Mechanisms for guaranteeing the continued public use of the area or equivalent area shall be required in accordance with Section 17.84A.080 of this chapter. Gates, guardhouses, barriers or other structures designed to regulate, restrict, or inhibit public access shall not be permitted within private street easements where they have the potential to limit, deter, or prevent public access to the shoreline, inland trails, or parklands where there is substantial evidence that prescriptive rights exist.

        2.     An access condition shall not serve to extinguish, adjudicate or waive potential prescriptive rights. The following language shall be added to the access condition in a permit with possible prescriptive rights: “Nothing in this condition shall be construed to constitute a waiver of any sort or a determination on any issue of prescriptive rights which may exist on the parcel itself or on the designated easement.” (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84A.080 Access title and guarantee.
        Where public coastal accessways are required by this chapter, approval of a coastal development permit for new development shall require guarantee of the access through deed restriction, or dedication of right-of-way or easement. Before the approval of a coastal development permit, the method and form of the access guarantee shall be approved by City Attorney, and shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, identifying the precise location and area to be set aside for public access. The method of access guarantee shall be chosen according to the following criteria:

        A.    Deed restriction. Shall be used only where an owner, association or corporation agrees to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of, and liability for, the public access area, subject to approval by the director.

        B.     Grant of fee interest or easement. Shall be used when a public agency or private organization approved by the Director is willing to assume ownership, operation, maintenance, and liability for the access.

        C.     Offer of dedication. Shall be used when no public agency or private organization is willing to accept fee interest or easement for accessway operation, maintenance, and liability. These offers shall not be accepted until maintenance responsibility and liability is established.

        D.    Legal description of an accessway—Recordation.

        1.     An access dedication (offer to dedicate or grant of easement) required pursuant to Section 17.84A.050.A of this chapter shall be described, in the condition of approval of the permit or other authorization for development in a manner that provides the public, the property owner, and the accepting agency with the maximum amount of certainty as to the location of the accessway. As part of the condition of approval, easements shall be described as follows:

        a.     For lateral access: along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to a point fixed at the most seaward extent of development (as applicable): the toe of the bluff, the intersection of sand with toe of revetment, the vertical face of seawall, or other appropriate boundary such as stringline or dripline. On beachfront property containing dune ESHA the required easement for lateral public access shall be located along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line landward to the ambulatory seawardmost limit of dune vegetation;

        b.     For blufftop access or trail access: extending inland from the daily bluff edge or along the alignment of a recreational trail;

        c.     For vertical access: extending from the public road to the mean high tide line (or daily bluff edge). A privacy buffer provided pursuant to Section 17.84A.080(E) shall be described as applicable.

        2.     Prior to the issuance of the coastal development permit or other authorization for development, the landowner shall execute and record a document in a form and content acceptable to the Coastal Commission (or the city authorized pursuant to Title 14 Cal. Code of Regulations Section 13574(b)), consistent with provisions of Section 17.84A.050.A of this chapter, irrevocably offering to dedicate (or grant an easement) to a public agency or private nonprofit association approved by the Coastal Commission, an easement for a specific type of access as described in Section 17.84A.050.B and a specific character of use as described in Section 17.84A.030.C of this chapter, as applicable to the particular condition.

        3.     The recorded document shall provide that: (1) the terms and conditions of the permit do not authorize any interference with prescriptive rights in the area subject to the easement prior to acceptance of the offer and, (2) development or obstruction in the accessway prior to acceptance of the offer is prohibited.

        4.     The recorded document shall include legal descriptions and a map drawn to scale of both the applicant’s entire parcel and the easement area. The offer or grant shall be recorded free of prior liens and any other encumbrances which the Coastal Commission (or the City authorized by the Commission pursuant to Title 14 California Code of Regulations Section 13574(b)) determines may affect the interest being conveyed. The grant of easement or offer to dedicate shall run with the land in favor of the People of the State of California, binding all successors and assignees, and the offer shall be irrevocable for a period of twenty-one years, such period running from the date of recording.

        E.     Privacy buffers.

        1.     Minimum requirements. Separation between a public accessway and adjacent residential use may be provided when necessary to protect the landowner’s privacy or security as well as the public’s right to use of the accessway. Any such buffer shall be provided within the development area and not with the accessway easement. Access should not be sited closer to any residential structure than the distance specified in the certified LUP, or where there is no distance specified, no closer than ten feet. The buffer can be reduced where separation is achieved through landscaping, fences or grade separation.

        F.     Implementation.

        1.     For any project where a public access easement is required, the preferred implementation should be through a recorded grant of easement to the city or to a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission who is willing to accept the easement and willing to operate and maintain the public accessway or trail. Where grants of easement are not feasible because neither the city nor private nonprofit association is willing to accept, maintain and operate the accessway, implementation of required access mitigation shall be implemented through a recorded Offer to Dedicate (OTD) an easement to a public agency or a designated private nonprofit association acceptable to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission.

        2.     For all grants of easement to the city, required as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit, the city shall open the easement to the public as soon as is feasible, and shall be responsible for operating and maintaining the accessway. If the city is unable to open, operate, and maintain the accessway, the city shall transfer the easement to another public agency or qualified nonprofit association acceptable to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission that is willing to accept, and has the demonstrated capabilities to maintain and operate the accessway.

        3.     In the case of an offer to dedicate or where the city transfers the easement to a private nonprofit association, an accessway shall not be required to be opened to public use until a public agency or private nonprofit association approved in accordance with Section 17.84A.080.D of this chapter agrees to accept responsibility for maintenance and liability of the access, except in cases where immediate public access is implemented through a deed restriction. New offers to dedicate public beach or trail access easements shall include an interim deed restriction that (1) states that the terms and conditions of the permit do not authorize any interference with prescriptive rights, in the area subject to the easement prior to acceptance of the offer and, (2) prohibits any development or obstruction in the easement area prior to acceptance of the offer.

        4.     Access facilities constructed on access easements (e.g., walkways, paved paths, boardwalks, etc.) shall be as wide as necessary to accommodate the numbers and types of users that can reasonably be expected. Width of facilities can vary for ramps or paved walkways, depending on site factors.

        5.     Any government agency may accept an offer to dedicate or grant of an easement if the agency is willing to operate and maintain the easement. For all grants of an easement or offers to dedicate that are required as conditions of coastal development permits approved by the city, the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission has the authority to approve a private non-profit association that seeks to accept the offer or the grant of easement. In order for the Executive Director to approve any private non-profit association, the non-profit association must submit a plan that indicates that the association will open, operate, and maintain the easement in accordance with terms of the recorded offer to dedicate or grant the easement.

        6.     The appropriate agency or organization to accept and develop trail dedication offers or grants of easement resulting from city issued CDPs shall be determined through coordination, where applicable, with the National Park Service, State Department of Parks and Recreation, State Coastal Conservancy, Del Norte County, and nonprofit land trusts or associations. Public agencies and private nonprofit associations which may be appropriate to accept offers to dedicate include, but shall not be limited to, the State Coastal Conservancy, State Department of Parks and Recreation, State Lands Commission, the City of Crescent City, County of Del Norte, special districts empowered with recreational facilities management authority, private land trusts and conservancies chartered to accept easements or fee interest dedications in the County of Del Norte, and other nongovernmental organizations.

        7.     Grants of public access easements or offers to dedicate shall be accepted for the express purpose of opening, operating, and maintaining the accessway for public use. Unless there are unusual circumstances, the accessway shall be opened within five years of acceptance. If the accessway is not opened within this period, and if another public agency or qualified private nonprofit association expressly requests ownership of the easement in order to open it to the public, the easement holder shall transfer the easement to that entity within six months of the written request. A coastal development permit that includes a grant of easement or offer to dedicate for public access as a term or condition shall require the recorded offer to dedicate to include the requirement that the easement holder shall transfer the easement to another public agency or private nonprofit association that requests such transfer, if the easement holder has not opened the accessway to the public within five years of accepting the offer.

        8.     Facilities to complement public access to and along the shoreline and trails shall be permitted where feasible and appropriate. This may include parking areas, restrooms, picnic tables, or other improvements. No facilities or amenities, including, but not limited to, those referenced above, shall be required as a prerequisite to the approval of any lateral or vertical accessway or trail OTD or grant of easement or as a precondition to the opening or construction of the accessway or trail. Where there is an existing, but unaccepted and/or unopened public access OTD, easement, or deed restriction for lateral, vertical, bluff or trail access or related support facilities, necessary access improvements shall be permitted to be constructed, opened and operated for the intended public use.

        9.     Any accessway which the managing agency or organization determines cannot be maintained or operated in a condition suitable for public use shall be offered to another public agency or qualified private nonprofit association that agrees to open and maintain the accessway in a condition suitable for public use.

        10.   All public access mitigation conditions or terms required by a CDP shall include, as a compliance component, a requirement that the permittee submit a detailed and surveyed map, drawn to scale, locating any proposed or required easements or deed restricted areas.

        G.    Timing of access implementation. The type and extent of access to be dedicated, and/or opened, constructed and maintained, as well as the method by which its continuing availability for public use is to be guaranteed, shall be established at the time of land use permit approval, as provided by this section.

        1.     Dedication. Dedication shall occur before issuance of construction permits or the start of any construction activity not requiring a permit.

        2.     Construction of improvements. Construction of improvements shall occur at the same time as construction of the approved development, unless another time is established through conditions of land use permit approval.

        3.     Interference with public use prohibited. Following an offer to dedicate public access in compliance with this section; the property owner shall not interfere with use by the public of the areas subject to the offer before and after acceptance by the responsible entity.

        H.    Title information. As a requirement for any public access condition, prior to the issuance of the permit or other authorization for development and prior to the recording of the document providing the accessway, the applicant shall be required to furnish a title report and all necessary subordination agreements. All offers or grants shall be made free of all encumbrances which the approving authority pursuant to Section 17.84A.080.D of this chapter determines may affect the interest being conveyed. If any such interest exists which could extinguish the access easement, it must be subordinated through a written and recorded agreement. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

Chapter 17.84B CALIFORNIA COASTAL ZONE RESOURCE PROTECTION PROCEDURES WATER QUALITY
17.84B.010 Purpose.
        This chapter implements applicable provisions of the local coastal program for ensuring the protection of the quality of coastal waters by providing standards for the review, authorization, and conditioning of new development and land uses consistent with the requirements of the California Coastal Act. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84B.020 Applicability.
        The provisions of this chapter apply to the review of coastal development permit applications for all development or uses proposed on sites that entails construction, grading, or other activities that involve ground disturbance, increases in impervious surface areas, or alterations in the direction, volume, or flow rate of surface or groundwater hydrology. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84B.030 Coastal development permit application contents.
        In addition to the information required by Section 17.84.020 for coastal development permit applications, the applicant shall provide the following supplemental information:

        A.    Construction pollution control plan. A construction-phase erosion, sedimentation, and polluted runoff control plan (“construction pollution control plan”) shall specify interim best management practices (BMPs) that will be implemented to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction, and prevent contamination of runoff by construction chemicals and materials, to the maximum extent practicable. The construction pollution control plan shall demonstrate that:

        1.     During construction, development shall minimize site runoff and erosion through the use of temporary BMPs (including, but not limited to, soil stabilization measures), and shall eliminate the discharge of sediment and other stormwater pollution resulting from construction activities (e.g., chemicals, vehicle fluids, asphalt and cement compounds, and debris), to the extent feasible.

        2.     Land disturbance activities during construction (e.g., clearing, grading, and cut-and-fill) shall be minimized, to the extent feasible, to avoid increased erosion and sedimentation. Soil compaction due to construction activities shall be minimized, to the extent feasible, to retain the natural stormwater infiltration capacity of the soil.

        3.     Construction shall minimize the disturbance of natural vegetation (including significant trees, native vegetation, and root structures), which is important for preventing erosion and sedimentation.

        4.     Development shall implement soil stabilization BMPs, including but not limited to re-vegetation, on graded or disturbed areas as soon as feasible.

        5.     Grading operations shall not be conducted during the rainy season (from October 1 to April 15), except in response to emergencies, unless the County determines that soil conditions at the project site are suitable, the likelihood of significant precipitation is low during the period of extension, (not to exceed one week at a time), and adequate erosion and sedimentation control measures will be in place during all grading operations.

        6.     The construction pollution control plan shall be submitted with the final construction drawings. The plan shall include, at a minimum, a narrative report describing all temporary polluted runoff, sedimentation, and erosion control measures to be implemented during construction, including:

        a.     Controls to be implemented on the amount and timing of grading.

        b.     BMPs to be implemented for staging, storage, and disposal of excavated materials.

        c.     Design specifications for structural treatment control BMPs, such as sedimentation basins.

        d.     Re-vegetation or landscaping plans for graded or disturbed areas.

        e.     Other soil stabilization BMPs to be implemented.

        f.      Methods to infiltrate or treat stormwater prior to conveyance off-site during construction.

        g.     Methods to eliminate or reduce the discharge of other stormwater pollutants resulting from construction activities (including but not limited to paints, solvents, vehicle fluids, asphalt and cement compounds, and debris) into stormwater runoff.

        h.     BMPs to be implemented for staging, storage, and disposal of construction chemicals and materials.

        i.      Proposed methods for minimizing land disturbance activities, soil compaction, and disturbance of natural vegetation.

        j.      A site plan showing the location of all temporary erosion control measures.

        k.     A schedule for installation and removal of the temporary erosion control measures.

        7.     A list of “good housekeeping” provisions including but not limited to inventory of products and chemicals used on site, plans for the cleanup of spill and leaks, and on site inspections by a qualified sediment and water quality control specialist.

        B.     Post-Construction Stormwater Plan. A plan to control post-construction stormwater runoff flows, and maintain or improve water quality (“post-construction stormwater plan”) shall specify site design, source control, and if necessary, treatment control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize stormwater pollution and minimize or eliminate increases in stormwater runoff volume and rate from the development after construction. Water quality treatment BMPs shall prioritize the integration of site design BMPs over source control BMPs over treatment control BMPs. The post-construction stormwater plan shall demonstrate that:

        1.     Following construction, erosion on the site shall be controlled to avoid adverse impacts on adjacent properties and resources.

        2.     Permanent erosion control measures shall be installed, as may be needed, depending upon the intensity of development proposed and the sensitivity of receiving waters.

        3.     Runoff from the project shall not increase sedimentation in receiving waters.

        4.     On-site filtering, grease, and/or sediment trapping systems shall be installed, as needed, to capture any pollutants contained in the runoff.

        5.     Permanent runoff/drainage control improvements, such as subsurface drainage interception, energy dissipaters, recovery/reuse cisterns, detention/retention impoundments, etc. shall be installed, as needed, at the point of discharge.

        6.     In the application and initial planning process, the applicant shall submit a preliminary post-construction stormwater plan, and prior to issuance of a building permit the applicant shall submit a final post-construction stormwater plan for approval by the County. The plan shall include, at a minimum, the following components:

        a.     Proposed site design and source control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction polluted runoff.

        b.     Proposed drainage improvements (including locations of infiltration basins, and diversions/ conveyances for upstream runoff).

        c.     Measures to maximize on-site retention and infiltration (including directing rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than to driveways).

        d.     Measures to maximize, to the extent practicable, the percentage of permeable surfaces, and to limit the percentage of directly connected impervious areas, to increase infiltration of runoff.

        e.     Methods to convey runoff from impervious surfaces into permeable areas of the property in a non-erosive manner.

        f.      A site plan showing the location of all permanent erosion control measures.

        g.     A schedule for installation and maintenance of the permanent erosion control measures.

        h.     A schedule for installation and maintenance of the sediment and debris filtration, grease and/or sediment trap, etc., as warranted for the type of development and site.

        i.      A site plan showing finished grades in one-foot contour intervals and associated drainage improvements.

        C.     Site design using low impact development techniques. The post-construction stormwater plan shall demonstrate the preferential consideration of low impact development (LID) techniques in order to minimize stormwater quality and quantity impacts from development. LID is a development site design strategy with a goal of maintaining or reproducing the site’s pre-development hydrologic functions of storage, infiltration, and groundwater recharge, as well as the volume and rate of stormwater discharges. LID strategies use small-scale integrated and distributed management practices, including minimizing impervious surfaces, infiltrating stormwater close to its source, and preservation of permeable soils and native vegetation. LID techniques to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:

        1.     Development shall be sited and designed to preserve the infiltration, purification, detention, and retention functions of natural drainage systems that exist on the site, to the maximum extent practicable. Drainage shall be conveyed from the developed area of the site in a non-erosive manner.

        2.     Development shall minimize the creation of impervious surfaces (including pavement, sidewalks, driveways, patios, parking areas, streets, and roof-tops), especially directly connected impervious areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Directly connected impervious areas include areas covered by a building, impermeable pavement, and/or other impervious surfaces, which drain directly into the storm drain system without first flowing across permeable land areas (e.g., lawns)

        3.     Development shall maintain or enhance, where appropriate and feasible, on-site infiltration of stormwater runoff, in order to preserve natural hydrologic conditions, recharge groundwater, attenuate runoff flow, and minimize transport of pollutants.

        Alternative management practices shall be substituted where the Public Works Director has determined that infiltration BMPs may result in adverse impacts, including but not limited to where saturated soils may lead to geologic instability, where infiltration may contribute to flooding, or where regulations to protect groundwater may be violated.

        4.     Development that creates new impervious surfaces shall divert stormwater runoff flowing from these surfaces into permeable areas in order to maintain, or enhance where appropriate and feasible, on-site stormwater infiltration capacity.

        5.     To enhance stormwater infiltration capacity, development applicants shall use permeable pavement materials and techniques (e.g., paving blocks, porous asphalt, permeable concrete, and reinforced grass or gravel), where necessary to retain water or reduce the rate of runoff. Permeable pavements shall be designed so that stormwater infiltrates into the underlying soil, to enhance groundwater recharge and provide filtration of pollutants.

        D.    Water quality and hydrology plan for developments of water quality concern. In addition to the information to be provided in the post-construction stormwater plan, applicants for “developments of water quality concern,” shall submit a water quality and hydrology plan and be subject to the additional requirements listed below.

        1.     “Developments of water quality concern” include the following:

        a.     Housing developments of ten or more dwelling units, including but not limited to residential subdivisions.

        b.     Developments that result in the creation, addition, or replacement of ten thousand square-feet or more of impervious surface area.

        c.     Parking lots with five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area, potentially exposed to stormwater runoff.

        d.     Vehicle service facilities, including retail gasoline outlets, commercial car washes, and vehicle repair facilities.

        e.     Industrial parks, commercial strip malls, or restaurants with five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area.

        f.      Commercial or industrial outdoor storage areas of five thousand square feet or more, or as determined by the County based on the use of the storage area, where used for storage of materials that may contribute pollutants to the storm drain system or coastal waters.

        g.     Heavy industrial developments.

        h.     Streets, roads, highways, and freeway construction of five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area, but not including stand-alone pedestrian pathways, trails, and off-street bicycle lanes.

        i.      All developments entailing the creation, addition, or replacement of two thousand five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area, located within one hundred twenty-five feet of the ocean or a coastal waterbody (including estuaries, wetlands, rivers, streams, and lakes), or that discharge directly to the ocean or a waterbody (i.e., outflow from the drainage conveyance system is composed entirely of flows from the subject development or redevelopment site, and not commingled with flows from adjacent lands.)

        2.     Additional Requirements for developments of water quality concern:

        a.     Water quality and hydrology plan. The applicant for a development of water quality concern shall be required to submit a water quality and hydrology plan (WQHP), prepared by a California Professional Engineer, Professional Geologist or Engineering Geologist, or California Landscape Architect, which supplements the post-construction stormwater plan. The WQHP shall include calculations, per County standards, that estimate increases in pollutant loads and changes in stormwater runoff hydrology (i.e., volume and flow rate) resulting from the proposed development, and shall specify the BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction water quality and hydrologic impacts. The WQHP shall also include operation and maintenance plans for post-construction treatment control BMPs. In the application and initial planning process, the applicant shall be required to submit for approval a preliminary WQHP, and prior to issuance of a building permit the applicant shall submit a final WQHP for approval by the County Engineer.

        b.     Selection of structural treatment control BMPs. If the County determines that the combination of site design and source control BMPs is not sufficient to protect water quality and coastal waters, a structural treatment control BMP (or suite of BMPs) shall also be required. Developments of water quality concern are presumed to require treatment control BMPs to meet the requirements of the coastal land use plan and state and federal water quality laws, unless the water quality and hydrology plan demonstrates otherwise.

        The water quality and hydrology plan for a development of water quality concern shall describe the selection of treatment controls BMPs. Applicants shall first consider the treatment control BMP, or combination of BMPs, that is most effective at removing the pollutant(s) of concern, or provide a justification if that BMP is determined to be infeasible.

        c.     Eighty-fifth percentile design standard for treatment control BMPs. For post-construction treatment of stormwater runoff in developments of water quality concern, treatment control BMPs (or suites of BMPs) shall be sized and designed to treat, infiltrate, or filter the amount of stormwater runoff produced by all storms up to and including the eighty-fifth percentile, twenty-four-hour storm event for volume-based BMPs, and/or the eighty-fifth percentile, one-hour storm event (with an appropriate safety factor of two or greater) for flow-based BMPs.

        d.     Maintain pre-development hydrograph. In developments of water quality concern where changes in stormwater runoff hydrology (i.e., volume and flow rate) may result in increased potential for streambank erosion, downstream flooding, or other adverse habitat impacts, hydrologic control measures (e.g., stormwater infiltration, detention, harvest and re-use, and landscape evapotranspiration) shall be implemented in order to ensure that the pre- and post-project runoff hydrographs match within ten percent for a two-year return frequency storm.

        5.     Content. The water quality and hydrology plan shall contain the following:

        a.     Site design, source control, and treatment control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction water quality and hydrologic impacts.

        b.     All of the information required in sub-section A for the post-construction stormwater plan.

        c.     Pre-development stormwater runoff hydrology (i.e., volume and flow rate) from the site.

        d.     Expected post-development stormwater runoff hydrology (i.e., volume and flow rate) from the site, with all proposed non-structural and structural BMPs in place.

        e.     Measures to infiltrate or treat runoff from impervious surfaces (including roads, driveways, parking structures, building pads, roofs, and patios) on the site, and to discharge the runoff in a manner that avoids potential adverse impacts. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, structural treatment control BMPs including biofilters, grassy swales, on-site de-silting basins, detention ponds, or dry wells.

        f.      A description of how the BMPs (or suites of BMPs) have been designed to infiltrate and/or treat the amount of storm water runoff produced by all storms up to and including the eighty-fifth percentile, twenty-four-hour storm event for volume-based BMPs, and/or the eighty-fifth percentile, one-hour storm event (with an appropriate safety factor of two or greater) for flow-based BMPs.

        g.     Appropriate structural post-construction Treatment Control BMPs selected to remove the specific runoff pollutants generated by the development, using processes such as gravity settling, filtration, biological uptake, media adsorption, or any other physical, chemical, or biological process.

        h.     A long-term plan and schedule for the monitoring and maintenance of all structural Treatment Control BMPs. All structural BMPs shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired as necessary to ensure their effective operation for the life of the development. Owners of these devices shall be responsible for ensuring that they continue to function properly, and additional inspections should occur after storms as needed throughout the rainy season. Repairs, modifications, or installation of additional BMPs, as needed, shall be carried out prior to the next rainy season.

        E.     Best management practices (BMPs); selection and incorporation.

        1.     All development shall incorporate effective site design and long-term post-construction source control BMPs, as necessary to minimize adverse impacts to water quality and coastal waters resulting from the development, to the maximum extent practicable. BMPs that protect post-construction water quality and minimize increases in runoff volume and rate shall be incorporated as necessary in the project design of developments in the following order of priority:

        a.     Site design BMPs: Project design features that reduce the creation or severity of potential pollutant sources, or reduce the alteration of the project site’s natural stormwater flow regime. Examples are minimizing impervious surfaces, preserving native vegetation, and minimizing grading.

        b.     Source control BMPs: Methods that reduce potential pollutants at their sources and/or avoid entrainment of pollutants in runoff, including schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, managerial practices, or operational practices. Examples are covering outdoor storage areas, use of efficient irrigation, and minimizing the use of landscaping chemicals.

        c.     Treatment control BMPs: Systems designed to remove pollutants from stormwater, by simple gravity settling of particulate pollutants, filtration, biological uptake, media adsorption, or any other physical, biological, or chemical process. Examples are vegetated swales, detention basins, and storm drain inlet filters.

        2.     The selection of BMPs shall be guided by the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Stormwater BMP Handbooks dated January 2003 (or the current edition), or an equivalent BMP manual that describes the type, location, size, implementation, and maintenance of BMPs suitable to address the pollutants generated by the development and specific to a climate similar to Del Norte County’s. Caltrans’ 2007 “Storm Water Quality Handbook: Project Planning and Design Guide” (or the current edition) may also be used to guide design of construction-phase BMPs. Additional guidance on BMPs is available from the state water resources and water quality boards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, regional entities such as the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association’s (BASMAA) “Start at the Source: Design Guidance Manual for Stormwater Quality Protection,” and/or as may be developed from time to time with technological advances in water quality treatment.

        3.     Where BMPs, are required, BMPs shall be selected that have been shown to be effective in reducing the pollutants typically generated by the proposed land use. The strategy for selection of appropriate BMPs to protect water quality and coastal waters shall be guided by Tables 17.84B-1 through 3, below, or equivalent tables which list pollutants of concern and appropriate BMPs for each type of development or land use. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84B.040 Supplementary findings.
        In addition to the findings for approval or conditional approval of a coastal development permit, development authorization, or other entitlement as required by Section 17.84.033, the following supplementary findings, based on factual evidence, shall be made for new development or uses having potential impacts to the quality of coastal waters:

        A.    Generally. All approved development will be, or has been conditioned to be, consistent with the development standards of Section 17.84B.050, as applicable. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84B.050 Development standards.
        A.    Development shall be undertaken in accordance with the approved erosion and stormwater control final plans and/or water quality management plan. Any proposed changes to the approved final plans shall be reported to the director. No changes to the approved final plans shall occur without an amendment to the coastal development permit, or equivalent, unless the director determines that no amendment is legally required.

        f.      An analysis of the potential impacts of the proposed development on the identified habitat or species;

        g.     An analysis of any unauthorized development, including grading or vegetation removal that may have contributed to the degradation or elimination of habitat area or species that would otherwise be present on the site in a healthy condition. The analysis shall identify all regulatory and restorative actions necessary to return the degraded and/or eliminated ESHA to the pre-disturbance state, in both form and function;

        h.     Project alternatives, including project modifications and off-site options designed to avoid and minimize impacts to identified habitat or species;

        i.      A buffer adequacy analysis consistent with the requirements of Section 17.84C.060.B, sub-Section 1 through 7, where an ESHA buffer of less than one hundred feet is proposed;

        j.      An evaluation of the impact the development may have on the habitat, and whether the development will be consistent with the biological continuance of the habitat. The report shall identify the maximum feasible mitigation measures to protect the resource and a program for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. Proposed mitigation measures shall meet the following standards:

        i.      They are specific, implementable, and, wherever feasible, quantifiable;

        ii.     They result in the maximum feasible protection, habitat restoration and enhancement of sensitive environmental resources. Habitat restoration and enhancement shall be required wherever feasible, in addition to the applicable baseline standard of either avoiding or minimizing significant habitat disruption;

        iii.    They are incorporated into a mitigation monitoring program; and

All development within or adjacent to rivers and streams coastal wetlands and/or riparian vegetation ESHA, shall comply with Section 17.84C.030.C.

        B.     Wetland delineation report for wetland ESHA. Where the biological study required by Section 17.84C.030.A above indicates the presence or potential for wetland species or indicators, the applicant shall additionally submit a delineation of all wetland areas on the project site.

        Wetland delineations shall be conducted according to the definitions of wetland boundaries contained in Section 13577(b) of the California Code of Regulations. A preponderance of hydric soils, a preponderance of wetland indicator species, or the persistent presence of surface or near-surface (rooting zone) hydrology, shall be considered presumptive evidence of wetland conditions. The delineation report shall include at a minimum: (1) a map at a scale of 1:2,400 or larger with polygons delineating all wetland areas, polygons delineating all areas of vegetation with a preponderance of wetland indicator species, and the location of sampling points; and (2) a description of the surface indicators used for delineating the wetland polygons. Paired sample points will be placed inside and outside of vegetation polygons and wetland polygons identified by the biologist doing the delineation.

        C.     Stream channel analysis. In addition to the biological report required by Section 17.84C.060.A, each permit application for a project that is situated in or within one hundred feet of rivers and streams coastal wetlands and/or riparian vegetation ESHAs shall include a site-specific stream channel analysis prepared by a hydrologist, civil engineer, or other qualified professional approved by the city to identify the precise boundary/top of bank of the subject watercourse. The director may waive this requirement if it is determined that the project, because of its size, location, or design will have no impact on the watercourse, or that sufficient information already exists and further analysis is not necessary. A required stream channel analysis shall include all hydro-geomorphic information and materials required by the department. The “top of bank” shall mean the upper elevation of land, having a slope not exceeding ten percent, which confines the channel waters flowing in the watercourse in their normal winter flow.

        6.     A textural grain size analysis of the spoils; and

        7.     A chemical assay of the dredge spoils for the presence of contaminants.

        E.     Filling and/or diking projects. For projects involving the placement of fill or the construction of diking, each permit applications shall provide the following information:

        1.     The type of fill or diking material to be used, including pilings or other structures;

        2.     The proposed location for the placement of the fill or diking;

        3.     The quantity or volume of materials to be placed and the surface area to be covered;

        4.     A description of any proposed use of the fill or diked areas; and

        5.     If the project is adjacent to a wetland or wetland buffer and may cause mud waves, a report shall be prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer which explains ways to prevent or mitigate the problem.

        F.     Wetland management plan. Proposed wetland restoration and/or enhancement projects, either as mitigation for an accompanying development project or to be undertaken independently of a development project, shall include a wetlands management plan prepared by a qualified wetlands expert. The wetlands management plan shall include all of the following, and any additional information deemed necessary by the review authority:

        1.     Goals and objectives. These shall include a description of the functional relationship of the existing and proposed wetland areas, such as habitat area, type, topography and soil characteristics, water flow patterns and water levels, and upland buffers. The stated goals and objectives should also be consistent with established regional habitat goals where possible. These regional goals must identify functions and/or habitats most in need of replacement or restoration and must be as specific as possible. A schedule to complete the restoration program shall be included.

        2.     Site plans. Site plans of the restoration or mitigation area shall identify the location and size of wetland areas to be preserved, restored, or created, and shall include the following:

        c.     Planting plan. The location of flora and fauna habitat areas and types, and any planting plans.

        3.     Proposed techniques and standards. The application shall include, as applicable, the following wetland preservation, restoration, and creation techniques and standards, indicating processes, practices and criteria used in identifying the wetlands and the adjoining upland buffers:

        a.     Watershed area and hydrology, water sources, water depths, water-control structures, water-quality watershed area and hydrology parameters, including treatment of urban runoff and water-level maintenance practices needed to achieve the necessary ambient water conditions and characteristics along with a stormwater management plan which identifies potential pollutants and ensures that runoff is substantially free of debris, pollutants and silt. Stormwater runoff management systems may include treatment swales, retention ponds, and other natural treatment systems. Treatment wetlands shall not be considered as habitat mitigation, but may address water quality functions of the impacted wetlands;

        b.     Planting plans which identify target wildlife species and specify native plant species obtained from local source genetic stocks whenever available, quantities, locations, size, space, or density; source of plant materials or seeds; timing, season, water, and nutrient requirements for planting; and, plant protection measures;

        f.      Identification of disposal area for any excavated or dredged material.

        4.     Implementation and monitoring plan. The wetland management plan shall include an implementation and monitoring plan, which shall provide:

        a.     Specific criteria and identification of process and responsibility for evaluating whether or not the goals of the Wetland Management Plan are being achieved at various stages in the development. Specifications for irrigation as needed, removal of exotic and nuisance vegetation, and maintenance;

        b.     Responsibility schedule and reporting requirements for monitoring the hydrology, vegetation, and wildlife of the wetland with a specified monitoring time frame (five years minimum for brackish or tidal marshes, and ten years for freshwater and seasonal wetlands);

        c.     Procedures for the correction of deficiencies or problems in the plan discovered after implementation, such as any needed plant substitutions, or modifications to site hydrology;

        d.     Identification of methods to ensure that the wetland will be protected in perpetuity; and

        e.     A schedule for grading, planting, and long-term maintenance.

        5.     Cost estimate. A cost estimate for implementing, monitoring, and maintaining the wetland. Performance security may be required to ensure proper installation, monitoring, and maintenance of the wetland.

        6.     Management plan. A management plan that addresses the long term fiscal, administrative, and technical requirements to successfully execute and maintain the wetland restoration and enhancement project. The plan shall identify the project funding source and assign responsibilities for the long-term maintenance of the wetland, and the management of the necessary ongoing activities.

        F.     Mitigation monitoring program. When filling, dredging, and/or diking wetlands for a permissible use cannot be avoided and there is a potential loss of existing wetland habitat or value, or the development project entails restoration and enhancement activities, a mitigation monitoring program must be submitted with the coastal development permit application that, when implemented, will result in the replacement of all lost wetland functions and habitat, where feasible. A mitigation monitoring plan can take several forms, although restoration is the most common form submitted to the city. The city shall administer the mitigation monitoring program; preparation and administration of the plan shall be paid for by the project applicant. A bond or other method acceptable to the city shall be established to guarantee successful completion of the mitigation project. The mitigation monitoring program shall, at a minimum:

        1.     Establish clearly stated goals and objectives that provide for the establishment of functions and values at least equal to those occurring at the impact site. The stated goals and objectives should also be consistent with established regional habitat goals where possible. These regional goals must identify functions and/or habitats most in need of replacement or restoration and must be as specific as possible. A schedule to complete the restoration program shall be included.

        2.     Provide adequate baseline data regarding the biological, physical, and chemical criteria for the restoration area. For a restoration plan to be deemed acceptable, it must include evidence or other conclusive information that:

        a.     The site can be purchased prior to commencement of the development project and dedicated to a public agency or otherwise permanently restricted in use to “open space;”

        b.     The site is located in an area no longer functioning in a manner beneficial to wetland species, such as a formerly productive wetland or estuary that is now biologically unproductive dry land;

        c.     The site can be restored to “equal or greater biological productivity” (Coastal Act Section 30607.1) than the area lost, with the same type and variety of plant and animal species. That is, the mitigation wetland would replace the functions and values existing at the impacted wetland; and

        d.     The site is located in the same region e.g., preferably within the same water body or watershed as the wetland impacted through development.

        3.     Provide documentation that the project will continue to function as a viable restored wetland site over the long-term.

        4.     Provide sufficient technical detail on the restoration design. This should include, at a minimum, an engineered grading plan and water control structures, methods for conserving or stockpiling topsoil, a planting program including removal of exotic species, a list of all species to be planted, sources of seeds and/or plants, timing of planting, plant locations and elevations on the restoration base map, and maintenance techniques.

        5.     Require independent monitoring of the site at least five years after completion of the mitigation project. The intent is to continue monitoring until the project has successfully met the stated goals and objectives, therefore the monitoring plan should specifically monitor the measurable success features of the project and adaptive management, approved by the city, should be employed in the event that success features are not achieved. A brief report with photographic evidence of the site should be submitted to the department on an annual basis. For larger projects where new wetlands are created, extended monitoring will be required.

        6.     Require annual survey for plants and animals of special concern throughout the various habitats of the mitigation area. The surveys should permit a determination of species composition and abundance for species of special concern and indicator species for each major ecological stratum. The presence/absence of terrestrial and aquatic organisms (especially aquatic insects) that are not species of special concern should be identified, as appropriate. Timing of the surveys should be considered, since the abundance of many plant and animal species often varies with season. Surveys sufficient to characterize the mitigation site should also be completed prior to any enhancement or restoration activities.

        7.     Monitor hydrology. For tidal wetlands include mapping, photographing, and/or measuring areas and associated depths of the areas inundated at high and low tide, tidal prism, and water velocity. For non-tidal wetlands, include mapping, photographing, and/or measuring areas and associated depths of the areas of permanent and seasonal saturation, inundation, and flowing waters.

        8.     Provide timely analysis and production of annual reports. These reports will be distributed to the city, the California Coastal.

        9.     Monitor water quality. Carry out repetitive sampling, as appropriate, of various chemical and physical constituents such as salinity, pH, nutrient concentration, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity throughout the year. The sampling pattern may vary throughout the year and may include more intensive sampling over several tidal cycles to determine short-term salinity patterns.

        10.   Monitor for evidence of tidal wetland inundation to determine if the depth or area of the tideland area changes in response to tidal influx/retreat.

        11.   Utilize adaptive management for the ongoing identification and correction of problems as they arise. With city approval, the project proponent, qualified biologist or other monitor should adopt an adaptive management corrective approach to problems that arise as conditions warrant.

        12.   Commission and other interested parties. The final monitoring report, submitted upon completion of the monitoring program, should analyze all monitoring data and present different management options. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84C.050 Supplementary findings.
        In addition to the findings for approval or conditional approval of a coastal development permit, development authorization, or other entitlement as required by these coastal zone zoning regulations, the following supplementary findings, based on factual evidence, shall be made for new development or uses occurring in or adjacent to ESHA:

        A.    Generally. All approved development will be, or has been conditioned to be, consistent with the development standards of Section 17.84C.060, as applicable.

        B.     Development within non-wetland ESHA. The development or use is:

        1.     Dependent on the resources within and/or supported by the ESHA; and

        2.     The environmentally sensitive habitat shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values.

        C.     Development within coastal wetland ESHA other than rivers and streams.

        1.     The development or use is:

        a.     For one or more of the following permissible uses:

        i.      New or expanded port, energy, and coastal-dependent industrial facilities, including commercial fishing facilities.

        ii.     Maintaining existing, or restoring previously dredged, depths in existing navigational channels, turning basins, vessel berthing and mooring areas, and boat launching ramps.

        iii.    In open coastal waters, other than wetlands, including streams, estuaries, and lakes, new or expanded boating facilities and the placement of structural pilings for public recreational piers that provide public access and recreational opportunities.

        iv.    Incidental public service purposes, including but not limited to, burying cables and pipes or inspection of piers and maintenance of existing intake and outfall lines.

        v.     Mineral extraction, including sand for restoring beaches, except in environmentally sensitive areas.

        vi.    Restoration purposes.

        vii.   Nature study, aquaculture, or similar resource dependent activities.

        b.     No feasible less environmentally damaging alternative exists;

        c.     Feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental effects; and

        d.     The functional capacity of the wetland is maintained or enhanced.

        D.    Development within rivers and streams coastal wetland ESHA.

        1.     The development or use:

        a.     Is for one or more of the following permissible uses:

        i.      Necessary water supply projects.

        ii.     Flood control projects where no other method for protecting existing structures in the floodplain is feasible and where such protection is necessary for public safety or to protect existing development.

        iii.    Developments where the primary function is the improvement of fish and wildlife habitat.

        b.     Incorporates the best mitigation measures feasible.

        E.     Development adjacent to ESHA. The development or use is:

        1.     Sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade those adjacent environmentally sensitive areas and buffers; and

        2.     Shall be compatible with the continuance of those habitat areas and buffers. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84C.060 Development standards.
        A.    Siting and design. The development or use shall be sited and designed consistent with the mitigation measures and recommendations of the approved biological resources report.

        B.     Buffer areas. New development adjacent to ESHA shall provide buffer areas to serve as transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human intrusion. The purpose of this buffer area is to provide for a sufficient area to protect environmentally sensitive habitats from significant degradation resulting from future development. Buffers shall be of a sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation of the ESHA they are designed to protect. The width of the buffer area shall be a minimum of one-hundred feet, unless an applicant can demonstrate, after consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game, and the city, that one-hundred feet is not necessary to protect the resources of that particular habitat area and the adjacent upland transitional habitat function of the buffer from possible significant disruption caused by the proposed development. The following criteria shall be utilized to review the adequacy of reduced-width buffer areas:

        1.     Biological significance of adjacent lands. Lands adjacent to a wetland, stream, or riparian habitat area vary in the degree to which they are functionally related to these habitat areas. Functional relationships may exist if species associated with such areas spend a significant portion of their life cycle on adjacent lands. The degree of significance depends upon the habitat requirements of the species in the habitat area (e.g., nesting, feeding, breeding, or resting). Where a significant functional relationship exists, the land supporting this relationship shall also be considered to be part of the ESHA, and the buffer zone shall be measured from the edge of these lands and be sufficiently wide to protect these functional relationships. Where no significant functional relationships exist, the buffer shall be measured from the edge of the ESHA that is adjacent to the proposed development.

        2.     Sensitivity of species to disturbance. The width of the buffer zone shall be based, in part, on the distance necessary to ensure that the most sensitive species of plants and animals will not be disturbed significantly by the permitted development. Such a determination shall be based on the following after consultation with the Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, or others with similar expertise:

        a.     Nesting, feeding, breeding, resting, or other habitat requirements of both resident and migratory fish and wildlife species;

        b.     An assessment of the short-term and long-term adaptability of various species to human disturbance; and

        c.     An assessment of the impact and activity levels of the proposed development on the resource.

        3.     Erosion susceptibility. The width of the buffer shall be based, in part, on an assessment of the slope, soils, impervious surface coverage, runoff characteristics, erosion potential, and vegetative cover of the parcel proposed for development and adjacent lands. A sufficient buffer to allow for the interception of any additional material eroded as a result of the proposed development shall be provided.

        4.     Use natural topography. Where feasible, use hills and bluffs adjacent to Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas, to buffer these habitat areas. Where otherwise permitted, locate development on the sides of hills away from Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas. Include bluff faces in the buffer area.

        5.     Use existing man-made features. Where feasible, use man-made features such as roads and dikes to buffer environmentally sensitive habitat areas.

        6.     Lot configuration and location of existing development. Where an existing subdivision or other development is largely built-out and the buildings are a uniform distance from a habitat area, at least that same distance shall be required as a buffer zone for any new development permitted. However, if that distance is less than one hundred feet, additional mitigation measures (e.g., planting of native vegetation) shall be provided to ensure additional protection.

        7.     Type and scale of development proposed. The type and scale of the proposed development will, to a large degree, determine the size of the buffer zone necessary to protect the ESHA. Such evaluations shall be made on a case-by-case basis depending upon the resources involved, the degree to which adjacent lands are already developed, and the type of development already existing in the area.

        Required buffer areas as determined by an approved biological report prepared pursuant to Section 17.84C.030A, or as authorized to be reduced to less than one hundred feet in width, shall be measured from the following points as applicable:

        •  The low-tide extent periphery of off-shore rocks and intertidal ESHA.

        •  The mean high tide line for intertidal zone ESHA.

        •  The perimeter of the sand dune/permanently established terrestrial vegetation interface for sand dune ESHA.

        •  The upland edge of a wetland for a wetland ESHA.

        •  The outer edge of the canopy of streamside vegetation for riparian vegetation ESHA, or from the top of stream bank where no riparian vegetation exists.

        •  The outer edge of the plants that comprise the rare plant community for rare plant community ESHA.

        C.     Compensatory mitigation. Where any dike and/or fill development is permitted in conformity with these coastal zone zoning regulations, mitigation measures shall include, at a minimum, either acquisition of equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity; provided however, that if no appropriate restoration site is available, an in-lieu fee sufficient to provide an area of equivalent productive value or surface area (including any litigation and/or restoration costs) shall be dedicated to an appropriate public agency, or such replacement site shall be purchased before the dike or fill development may proceed. Such mitigation measures shall not be required for temporary or short-term fill or diking; provided, that a bond or other evidence of financial responsibility is provided to assure that restoration of the project site will be accomplished in the shortest feasible time.

        D.    Where dredging is permitted in conformity with these coastal zone zoning regulations, mitigation measures must at least include the planning and implementation of dredging and spoils disposal which avoids significant disruption of wetlands habitat and/or water circulation, consideration of limitations upon timing of the operation, type of operation, quality of dredge material removed and location of the spoil site, and, where feasible, the transportation of dredge spoils suitable of beach replenishment to appropriate beaches or into suitable longshore current systems.

        E.     Where diking, filling, or dredging are permitted in conformity with these coastal zone zoning regulations, the development must maintain or enhance the functional capacity of the existing sensitive habitat area. Functional capacity means the ability of the wetland or estuary to be self-sustaining and to maintain natural species diversity. In order to establish that the functional capacity is being maintained, the applicant must demonstrate all of the following:

        1.     That the project does not alter presently occurring plant and animal populations in the ecosystem in a manner that would impair the long-term stability of the ecosystem; i.e., natural species diversity, abundance and composition are essentially unchanged as a result of the project;

        2.     That the project does not harm or destroy a species or habitat that is rare or endangered;

        3.     That the project does not eliminate a species or habitat that is essential to the natural biological functioning of the wetland or estuary;

        4.     That the project does not significantly reduce consumptive (e.g., fishing, aquaculture and hunting) or nonconsumptive (e.g., water quality and research opportunity) values of the wetland or estuarine ecosystem.

        F.     Where development is permitted within a stream or river the following requirements must be met:

        1.     All channelizations, dams, or other substantial alterations of rivers and streams shall incorporate the best mitigation measures feasible to minimize adverse environmental effects. Substantial alterations shall include channelizations, dams, or comparable projects which significantly disrupt the habitat value of a particular river or stream. A development which does not significantly disrupt the habitat value of a particular river or stream is one which maintains or enhances the functional capacity of that river or stream. Roads and bridges necessary to cross streams and rivers may be permitted if there is no feasible less environmentally damaging alternative and if feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental effects.

        2.     Flood-control projects shall be subject to both of the following conditions:

        a.     The project must be necessary for public safety or to protect existing development;

        b.     There must be no other feasible method for protecting existing development in the floodplain.

        3.     Boating facilities constructed in streams are subject to the same requirements as boating facilities constructed elsewhere.

        G.    ESHA restoration and enhancement. All ESHA restoration and enhancement work, whether required as mitigation to offset impacts of development or proposed independent of a development project, shall be conducted in conformance with the approved mitigation management plan and monitoring program.

        H.    Vegetation removal. Existing native vegetation shall not be removed within an ESHA unless authorized through coastal permit approval to accommodate approved construction. Vegetation removal limited to tree branch lopping, shrub pruning, and the mowing of grasses and forbs within thirty feet to reduce fire and other hazards may be approved by the director without a coastal development permit. After construction, unpaved areas shall be replanted to provide for the reestablishment of a one-hundred percent vegetation cover within two years. At five years, the site should support the same habitat as that removed. Plant species that would provide bank stability and habitat enhancement should be used where applicable. Remedial actions (e.g., planting of native species and removal of invasive horticultural species) should be implemented as necessary to ensure that the site will consist of at least seventy-five percent native species at the end of five years.

        I.      Landscaping. A landscaping plan shall be submitted to the City for approval prior to construction for any site where development will disturb existing or potential native plant habitat. The plan shall provide for vegetation restoration in compliance with subsection A above. Landscaping with exotic plants shall be limited to outdoor living space immediately adjacent to the proposed development. Invasive non-native plants including but not limited to pampas grass (Cortaderia sp.), acacia (Acacia sp.), broom (Genista sp.), English ivy (Hedera helix), and iceplant (Carpobrotus sp., Mesembryanthemum sp.) pose a threat to indigenous plant communities. No plant species listed as problematic and/or invasive by the California Native Plant Society, the California Invasive Plant Council, or listed as a “noxious weed” by the governments of the State of California or the United States shall be approved as part of any proposed landscaping.

        J.      Fencing. Fencing within or adjacent to ESHAs shall be restricted to that which will not impact public views or the free passage of native wildlife, and shall employ design and materials determined by the review authority to be compatible with the visual and biological character of the habitat.

        K.    Resource protection during construction. Habitat areas containing vegetation that is essential to the maintenance of the habitat and/or rare or endangered plant or animal species shall be protected from disturbance by construction activities. Temporary wire mesh fencing shall be placed around habitat prior to construction, and protected areas shall not be used by workers or for the storage of machinery or materials. Inspections for compliance shall occur during construction.

        L.     Herbicide use. The use and disposal of any herbicides for invasive species removal shall follow the written directions of the manufacturer, shall comply with all conditions imposed by the city, and shall be accomplished in a manner that will fully protect adjacent native vegetation and coastal water quality.

        M.    Rodenticide use. Rodenticides containing any anticoagulant compounds, including, but not limited to, bromadiolone or diphacinone shall not be used. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

17.84G.030 Coastal development permit application contents.
        A.    1.     Geologic Hazards. All proposed new development located in or near an area subject to geologic hazards shall be required to submit a geologic/soils/geotechnical study report prepared by a Certified Engineering Geologist, Geotechnical Engineer, or registered engineer qualified in hydrology and soil mechanics, as appropriate for the intended structural improvements, that identifies any geologic hazards affecting the proposed development site and any necessary mitigation measures. The geologic/soils/geotechnical report shall include a statement by the consulting professionals that the project site is suitable for the proposed development, that the development will be safe from geologic hazard, and that the development will in no way contribute to instability on or off the subject site. Such reports shall be subject to the review and approval of the department staff, and may include peer-review by a similarly-licensed professional.

        2.     Geology report.

        f.      Ground and surface water conditions and variations, including hydrologic changes caused by the development (e.g., introduction of sewage, effluent, and irrigation water to the groundwater system, alterations to surface drainage, and the like);

        g.     Potential erodibility of the site and mitigation measures to be used to ensure minimized erosion problems before and after construction (i.e., landscape and drainage design);

        h.     Effects of marine erosion on the coastal bluffs;

        i.      Potential effects of seismic forces resulting from a maximum credible earthquake;

        j.      Any other factors that might affect slope or bluff stability;

        k.     Whether the proposed project will be subject to or contribute to significant geologic instability throughout the one-hundred-year life span of the project;

        l.      Effects of future sea level rise on the development;

        m.    Slope stability and bluff erosion rate determination performed as outlined in Sections B.2 and B.3 below; and

        In addition to all applicable information required by sub-Section 3a-3n above, all applications for new shoreline structures shall include an analysis of beach erosion, wave run-up, and tsunami and flood hazards prepared by a licensed civil engineer with expertise in coastal engineering. These reports shall address and analyze the effects of said development in relation to the following:

        p.     Surveyed locations of mean high tide lines acceptable to the State Lands Commission;

        q.     The availability of public access to the beach;

        r.      The area of the project site subject to design wave run-up, based on design conditions;

        v.     Future projections in sea level rise; and

        w.    Project alternatives designed to avoid or minimize impacts to public access.

        B.     Blufftop and shoreline development hazards. A coastal development permit application for development with three hundred feet of a bluff line or edge as defined shall include the following supplemental information and analyses:

        1.     Public access information. Applications for blufftop or shoreline development, including but not limited to shoreline protective structures, shall include a site map that shows all existing easements, deed restrictions, or offers of dedication and/or other dedications for public access or open space and provides documentation that the development shall be located outside of and consistent with the provisions of such easement or offers.

        2.     Slope stability analysis. For the purpose of this section, quantitative slope stability analyses shall be undertaken as follows:

        a.     The analyses shall demonstrate a factor of safety greater than or equal to 1.5 for the static condition and greater than or equal to 1.1 for the seismic condition. Seismic analyses may be performed by the pseudostatic method, but in any case shall demonstrate a permanent displacement of less than fifty mm.

        b.     Slope stability analyses shall be undertaken through cross-sections modeling worst case geologic and slope gradient conditions. Analyses shall include postulated failure surfaces such that both the overall stability of the slope and the stability of the surficial units are examined.

        c.     The effects of earthquakes on slope stability (seismic stability) shall be addressed through pseudostatic slope analyses assuming a horizontal seismic coefficient of at least 0.15 grams, and shall be evaluated in conformance with the guidelines published by the American Society of Civil Engineers, Los Angeles Section (ASCE/SCEC), “Recommended Practices for Implementation of DMG Special Publication 117, Guidelines for Analyzing and Mitigating Landslide Hazards in California.”

        d.     All slope analyses shall be performed using shear strength parameters (friction angle and cohesion), and unit weights determined from relatively undisturbed samples collected at the site. The choice of shear strength parameters shall be supported by direct shear tests, triaxial shear test, or literature references.

        e.     All slope stability analyses shall be undertaken with water table or potentiometric surfaces for the highest potential ground water conditions.

        f.      If anisotropic conditions are assumed for any geologic unit, strike and dip of weakness planes shall be provided, and shear strength parameters for each orientation shall be supported by reference to pertinent direct sheer tests, triaxial shear test, or literature.

        g.     When planes of weakness are oriented normal to the slope or dip into the slope, or when the strength of materials is considered homogenous, circular failure surfaces shall be sought through a search routine to analyze the factor of safety along postulated critical failure surfaces. In general, methods that satisfy both force and moment equilibrium (e.g., Spencer, Morgenstern-Price, and General Limit Equilibrium) are preferred. Methods based on moment equilibrium alone (e.g., Bishop’s Method) also are acceptable. In general, methods that solve only for force equilibrium (e.g., Janbu’s method) are discouraged due to their sensitivity to the ratio of normal to shear forces between slices.

        h.     If anisotropic conditions are assumed for units containing critical failure surfaces determined above, and when planes of weakness are inclined at angles ranging from nearly parallel to the slope to dipping out of slope, factors of safety for translational failure surfaces shall also be calculated. The use of a block failure model shall be supported by geologic evidence for anisotropy in rock or soil strength. Shear strength parameters for such weak surfaces shall be supported through direct shear tests, triaxial shear test, or literature references.

        i.      The selection of shear strength values is a critical component to the evaluation of slope stability. Reference should be made to American Society of Civil Engineers, Los Angeles Section (ASCE/SCEC), “Recommended Practices for Implementation of DMS Special Publication 117, Guidelines for Analyzing and Mitigating Landslide Hazards in California” when selecting shear strength parameters.

        3.     Bluff retreat rate. For the purpose of this chapter, the long-term average bluff retreat rate shall be determined by the examination of historic records, surveys, aerial photographs, published or unpublished studies, or other evidence that unequivocally show the location of the bluff edge through time. The long-term bluff retreat rate is an historic average that accounts both for periods of exceptionally high bluff retreat, such as during extreme storm events, and for long periods of relatively little or no bluff retreat. Accordingly, the time span used to calculate a site-specific long-term bluff retreat rate shall be as long as possible, but in no case less than fifty years. Further, the time interval examined shall include the strong El Niño winters of 1982-1983, and 1997-1998. The expected bluff retreat rate over the expected life of the development shall be based in part on the historic bluff retreat rate, but shall also include consideration of the effects of continued historic rates of sea level rise, potential accelerated sea level rise, increase in significant wave heights, and increase in storm intensity and frequency, as is expected under most scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or as anticipated in studies prepared for California coastal areas pursuant to Executive Order S-13-08.

        4.     Erosion control plan. All coastal development permit applications for development on blufftop and shoreline parcels shall include a site specific erosion control plan. The plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer qualified in hydrology and soil mechanics, and shall ensure that the development will not create nor contribute to the erosion or failure of any bluff face, and will eliminate or mitigate any adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply to the maximum extent feasible. The plan shall identify drainage and erosion control features to ensure that surficial erosion or ground saturation will not that incorporate structural and non-structural stormwater runoff and water quality best management practices (BMPs) to control the volume, velocity, flow direction, and pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development, including construction, grading, and landscaping, and bioswale treatment and/or other facilities designed to accommodate the eighty-fifth percentile one-hour rainfall event for volumetric-based systems and the eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour precipitation event for flow-based facilities.

        C.     New Beachfront Development and Shoreline Structures. In addition to all applicable information required by sub-sections A and B above, all applications for new beachfront development or shoreline structures shall include an analysis of beach erosion, wave run-up, and tsunami and flood hazards prepared by a registered civil engineer with expertise in coastal processes. These reports shall address and analyze the effects of said development in relation to the following:

        1.     The profile of the beach;

        2.     Surveyed locations of mean high tide lines acceptable to the State Lands Commission;

        3.     The FEMA Base Flood Elevation and other mapped areas (A,B, or V zones);

        4.     Future projections in sea level rise;

        5.     The area of the project site subject to design wave run-up (normally the one-hundred-year wave event), based on design beach and water level conditions (normally taken to be an eroded, winter profile beach, high tide and the future erosion and sea level rise conditions appropriate for the project life);

        6.     Foundation design requirements;

        7.     The long-term effects of proposed development on sand supply; and

        8.     Project alternatives designed to avoid or minimize impacts to beach and public access.

        D.    Sea Level Rise Analysis. Applications for development adjacent to the shore or that may be subject to the influence of sea level over the life of the project shall include an analysis of possible impacts from sea level rise. The analysis shall take into account the best available scientific information with respect to the effects of long-range sea level rise for all requisite geologic, geotechnical, hydrologic, and engineering investigations. Residential and commercial development at nearshore sites shall analyze potential coastal hazard sensitivities for a range of potential global sea level rise scenarios, from three to six feet per century. The analysis shall also take into consideration regional sea level variability, localized uplift or subsidence, local topography, bathymetry and geologic conditions. A similar sensitivity analysis shall be performed for critical facilities, energy production and distribution infrastructure, and other development projects of major community significance using a minimum rise rate of four and one-half feet per century. These hazard analyses shall be used to identify current and future site hazards, to help guide site design and hazard mitigation and to identify sea level thresholds after which limitations to the development’s design and siting would cause the improvements to become significantly less stable.

        E.     Public access information. Applications for blufftop or shoreline development, including but not limited to shoreline protective structures, shall include a site map that shows all existing easements, deed restrictions, or offers-of-dedication and/or other dedications for public access or open space and provides documentation that the development shall be located outside of and consistent with the provisions of such easement or offers. The application shall also identify all available beach access within one-half miles upcoast or downcoast of the proposed development site.

        F.     Floodplain development. A coastal development permit application for development within an identified floodplain in the coastal zone, including but not limited to those areas shown on FEMA-FIRM community panel series 0615C 0214E, 0615C 0218E, 06015C 0327E, and 0615C 0331E, shall include the following supplemental information and analyses:

        1.     Site plans and elevations depicting the height of the base flood elevation relative to the floor height of the structures; and

        2.     Copies of any flood elevation certificates, flood-proofing certificates, or other as-built verifications of floodplain management conformance prepared for the structures.

        G.    Tsunami runup and inundation. A coastal development permit application for development within an identified tsunami runup and/or inundation area, including but not limited to those areas depicted on the latest government-prepared tsunami hazard maps, shall include the following supplemental information and analyses:

        1.     An analysis of the vulnerability of any proposed structural improvements to instability or damage associated with tsunami inundation up to and including wave heights resulting from a near-source maximum credible Cascadia subduction zone seismic event. The analysis shall take into consideration local uplift or subsidence, and a three- to six-foot rise in sea level over one hundred years, a minimum of four and one-half feet of sea level rise over one hundred years for critical facilities, and greater sea level rise rates if development is expected to have a long economic life, the proposed development has few options for adaptation to sea level higher than the design minimum, or if the best available scientific information at the time of review supports a higher design level. The analysis shall address potential damage and instability from in-coming and out-flow waters, including wave strike and foundation scour. The analysis shall identify design and siting mitigation measures to feasibly reduce potential exposure of persons and property to flooding and instability risks;

        2.     A tsunami safety plan containing information as to the existence of the threat of tsunamis from both distant- and local-source seismic events, the need for prompt evacuation upon the receipt of a tsunami warning or upon experiencing seismic shaking for a local earthquake, and the evacuation route to take from the development site to areas beyond potential inundation.

        H.    Wildfire hazards. A coastal development permit application for development within an identified wildfire hazard areas, including but not limited to those areas depicted on the latest adopted fire hazard severity maps, shall include the following supplemental information and analyses:

        1.     A fire safe compliance plan, illustrating how the development would conform to the state and local agency emergency vehicle access, street signage, fuel modification, defensible space, fire-fighting water supply, and building code standards applicable to the class of development.

        I.      Hazardous materials. A coastal development permit application for commercial and/or industrial development proposing the use, storage, or transportation of hazardous materials subject to state and federal regulation, shall include the following supplemental information and analyses:

        1.     An accidental spill/release response and cleanup plan, detailing training and logistics for prompt response to, containment of, and clean up of, any accidentally released or spilled hazardous materials. The plan will include an inventory of spill/release containment and clean-up materials and equipment to be stockpiled at the project site, responsible parties for initiating a response activity and provisions for notification of responsible agencies, as appropriate, including but not limited to the county department of public health, county sheriff’s office, police and fire departments, and state and federal oil spill responders. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        B.     Development or uses in to geologic, flooding, and wildfire hazard areas. The development or use has been designed and sited to:

        1.     Minimize risks to life and property;

        2.     Assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs.

        C.     Commercial or industrial development involving the use, storage, or transport of hazardous materials. The development or use has been designed and sited such that protection against the spillage of crude oil, gas, petroleum products, or hazardous substances shall be provided and that effective containment and cleanup facilities and procedures shall be provided for accidental spills that do occur. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.84G.050 Development standards.
        Development in areas subject to natural or man-made hazards shall only be authorized subject to the following conditions:

        3.     Provisions are included in the authorization should slope instability and/or bluff retreat occur at locations or rates other than anticipated, the permittee is required to seek a permit amendment for relocation of the structure or to authorize other stabilizing actions once the blufftop edge or area of instability encroach within ten feet of the structure; and

        4.     Rights to future construction of a sea wall, cliff retaining wall, or other protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs are waived by recorded deed restriction.

        C.     Floodplains and other flood-prone sites.

        1.     The development has been conditioned to meet all requirements of the flood damage prevention Chapter 21.45; and

        2.

        The sole purpose of any variance shall be to prevent discrimination or undue hardship when special circumstances exist which deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the same zoning classification and vicinity because of literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this title. The planning commission shall have the authority, as an administrative act, subject to the provision of this section to grant a variance with respect to fences, walls, hedges, screening, landscaping, side yards, front or rear yards, site area, floor area, height of structures or distance between structures. Such variances from the provisions of this code shall be in harmony with its general purpose and intent so that the spirit of this code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. No variance shall be granted which would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by any other property in the same vicinity and zoning classification. No variance may be granted by the planning commission or the city council on appeal, all of the following shall be found:

        A.    That there are exceptional and extraordinary circumstances applicable to the property involved. The variance shall be limited to that necessary to correct the discrimination or undue hardship;

        B.     That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone and denied to the property in question;

        C.     That the granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such vicinity and zone in which property is located;

        D.    The granting of such variances in the coastal zone is consistent with and implements the certified LCP, and that the granting of such variances does not reduce or in any way adversely affect the requirements to protect coastal resources, and the variance implements the purposes of the zone adopted in implementing the LCP;

        E.     That a public hearing wherein the applicant is heard and in which he substantiates all of the conditions cited above;

        F.     That the planning commission in reviewing such requests and hearing the evidence finds that conditions of subsections A. through F. of this section have been met.

        Variances shall be granted solely for deviations from the physical development standards of the development site’s zoning district (i.e., building height, minimum lot area except for land divisions and lot line adjustments, front, side and rear yard areas, special yards and distances between buildings). Variances shall not be granted for deviation from the requirements for buffer around environmentally sensitive habitat area or for development setbacks from geologically unstable areas, or from any other provisions relating to the protection of coastal resources. Nothing in this chapter substitutes for or obviates the need to secure a coastal development permit pursuant to Chapter 17.84. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.85.020 Application—Notice and hearing.
        Upon filing of a written application for a variance by a property owner or by a lessee with the consent of the owner, the planning commission shall give seven days notice to the residents and owners of all properties which are immediately adjacent and opposite from the property in question. Such notice shall give intent to consider at a public hearing the granting of the variance. Upon filing of an application for variance the planning director shall give notice by mail of the time, place and purpose thereof to the applicant as well as to the public in general. Within twenty days following the termination of the public hearing on a variance the planning commission shall announce its findings by formal report, and such report shall recite among other things the facts and reasons which, in its opinion, made the granting or denial of the variance necessary to carry out the provisions and general purpose of these regulations, and shall order that the variance be granted or denied, and if such report orders that the variance be granted it shall also recite such conditions and limitations as it may impose. The formal report of the planning commission announcing its findings and orders after a hearing on and application for variance shall become a permanent record in the files of the planning commission. No later than ten days following the rendering of a decision ordering that a variance be granted or denied a copy of the report shall be mailed to the applicant, any other person requesting such report, and to the California Coastal Commission. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.85.030 Appeal.
        The order of the planning commission in granting or denying a variance shall become final and effective ten days after the rendering of its report granting or denying the variance unless within such ten-day period an appeal in writing is filed with the city by any person dissatisfied with the decision of the planning commission. The filing of such appeal within such limit shall stay the effective date of the order of the planning commission until such time as the council has acted on the appeal. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.85.040 Council action—Granting or denial.
        A.    Upon request of a written appeal filed with the council as provided in this chapter, the planning commission shall transmit to the council the planning commission’s complete record of the case. The city council shall, within a period not to exceed forty days following receipt of the written appeal, conduct a duly advertised public hearing, public notice of which shall be given as provided in Section 17.81.040 of this title, and in addition provide written notice to individuals requesting such notices as well as to the California Coastal Commission.

        B.     The council shall announce its findings and decision by formal resolution not more than forty days following the termination of proceedings of the hearing. Such resolution shall recite among other things the facts and reasons which, in the opinion of the council, make the granting or denial of the variance necessary to carry out the general purpose of this chapter and shall order that the variance be granted or denied or modified subject to such conditions or limitations that it may impose. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.85.050 Copies of resolution for applicant and commission.
        Not later than ten days following the adoption of a resolution ordering that a variance be granted or denied, a copy of such resolution shall be mailed to the applicant, any other parties requesting notice of the action, and to the California Coastal Commission, and one copy shall be attached to the Planning Commission’s file on the case and such file returned to the planning commission for permanent filing.

17.86.010 Purpose of regulations.
        The regulations set forth in this chapter are enacted to limit the development of the beachfront or waterfront area of city owned lands to recreational and public purposes and to provide for public access to local beaches on adjacent lands. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.86.020 Building on city owned beachfront lands.
        Proposals for building on city owned beachfront lands shall be subject to the following review and standards:

        A.    Detailed site plan. All applicants or prospective lessees or developers shall provide a detailed site plan acceptable to the city planning commission prior to City Council review of the proposal.

        B.     Preliminary plans—Objectives, standards and conditions generally. Prior to application for a coastal development, conditional use, or building permit in connection with beachfront development, prospective developers shall submit preliminary plans and proposed building elevations to the city planning commission, and shall be guided by the following objectives, standards and conditions:

        1.     Development along and upon the city’s waterfront area shall be designed and used for tourists, recreational and harbor-related purposes.

        2.     The city shall reserve such rights-of-way for street and utility purposes as deemed necessary or appropriate.

        3.     The general character of development shall be in keeping with that of the visual resources of surrounding area and reflect the highest standards of architectural design represented in the city area. Natural materials such as wood, timber or rock materials should be used wherever practical. A festive atmosphere is encouraged, but all elements and aspects of the development shall be carefully designed and in good taste.

        4.     The city planning commission shall examine the size, location, color, proportions, textures, orientation, accessibility, landscaping and other features of each proposed development, and impose design and siting restrictions as necessary to ensure that all developments of the city beachfront:

        a.     protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas;

        b.     minimize the alteration of natural land forms;

        c.     are visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas;

        d.     restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas, where feasible; and

        e.     in areas determined to be highly scenic, are subordinate to the character of its setting.

        5.     Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the standards relating to zoning as provided in this code, and all additional areas up to fifty percent shall be reserved for off-street parking. All off-street parking areas should be suitably paved, lighted and screened by landscaping or other appropriate materials.

        C.     Leases generally. The particular area of the city’s waterfront property available for leasing to and development by applicants shall be subject to the approval of the City Council. When an application is made for leasing and developing a portion of the waterfront area, the City Council shall review the application and approve or disapprove the development site.

        D.    Lease approval. All lease agreements entered into between the city and developers or lessees, public or private, shall be subject to the approval as to form by the city attorney. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

 

17.86.030 Public access.
        As set forth by the California Coastal Act new development along the immediate shoreline shall provide public access to and along the shoreline as outlined in Chapter 17.84A and in the following provisions.

        A.    For the purposes of this section “new development” does not include:

        1.     Replacement of any structure destroyed by natural disaster. Such replacement structure shall conform to applicable existing zoning requirements, shall be for the same use as the destroyed structure, shall not exceed either the floor area, height, or bulk of the destroyed structure by more than ten percent, and shall be sited in the same location of the affected property as the destroyed structure. (As used in this subdivision, “natural disaster” means any situation in which the force or forces which destroyed the structure to be replaced were beyond the control of the owner.)

        2.     The demolition and reconstruction of a single-family residence, provided that the reconstructed residence shall not exceed either the floor area, height or bulk of the former structure by more than ten percent, and that the reconstructed residence shall be sited in the same location on the affected property as the former structure.

        3.     Improvements to any structure which do not change the intensity of its use, which do not increase either the height, or bulk of the structure by more than ten percent, which do not block or impede public access, and which do not result in a seaward encroachment by the structure. (As used in this subdivision, “bulk” means total interior cubic volume as measured from the exterior surface of the structure.)

        4.     Any repair or maintenance activity which does not result in an addition to, or enlargement of maintenance activities; unless such activity will have an adverse impact on internal public access to the beach.

        B.     Lateral Access. New development along the immediate shoreline shall provide lateral access by access easements along the shoreline, inland of the mean high tide to the first line of vegetation or to the crest of the paralleling bluff in areas of coastal bluffs. No permit shall be issued for a project which obstructs lateral access on the immediate shoreline, inland of the mean high tide to the first line of vegetation, or the crest of the paralleling bluff. Exceptions to this requirement would be:

        1.     For the placement of navigational aids or shoreline protective devices to protect existing public structures;

        2.     Where access is inconsistent with public safety, military security needs, or the protection of fragile coastal resources; or

        3.     Where adequate access already exists.

        C.     Vertical Access. Development along the immediate shoreline shall provide public access by access easements from the nearest public roadway to the shoreline. Priority for vertical access shall be restricted to that for sandy beach areas. Accessways to rock beaches will not be required for areas where public safety is of concern or where increased visitor pressure on biological areas or areas of unique character, sensitive to visitor pressure, will be degraded. Other exceptions to this requirement would be:

        1.     Where access would have unavoidable adverse impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas;

        2.     An existing vertical accessway, adequate to meet anticipated access needs, is located one-quarter mile or less from the development;

        3.     Where the parcel is too small to allow for an adequate vertical access corridor without passing within twenty-five feet of a proposed dwelling; or

        4.     Where the project site is too small for the proposed development and the access with improvements related to its use (i.e., parking).

        D.    Design and Use.

        1.     Access proposals which provide access for the general public over a wide range of income levels, ages, and social groups shall have priority over other private development accessways.

        2.     The lateral access required shall be limited to passive recreational uses unless another type of use is specified as a condition of the development permit.

        3.     The vertical access required shall be limited to the right of pass and repass unless additional uses are specified as a condition of development. If possible, the accessway should be sited along the border of the development and shall extend from the road (or boundary line closest to the road) to the shoreline. Adequate provision for maintenance and safety access shall also be made.

        E.     Dedication of Public Access

        1.     Prior to the issuance of a permit for development which requires coastal public access the applicant shall be required to record legal documents for the provision of access to the city, on behalf of the public, by easement.

        2.     As a condition to the issuance of the permit, the applicant shall be required to furnish a CLTA title report and all necessary subordination agreements. Title insurance may also be required where extensive easements are being granted. The amount of insurance shall be estimated on the basis of what it would cost to acquire an equivalent access or recreational use easement elsewhere in the vicinity.

        3.     Copies of the document to be recorded, title report, current deed and permit shall be forwarded to the Coastal Commission within ten days after submission of all of the documents to the city. The city may make minor revisions to the documents to assure that the public right of access to and/or along the shoreline are protected and capable of being implemented. The Coastal Commission shall review the documents and notify the city and the applicant of any recommended revisions. If notification of inadequacy has not been received within forty-two days, the city may record the documents and issue the permit. If revisions are recommended by the Commission, the permit shall not be issued until the discrepancies have been resolved.

        F.     Improvements

        1.     Any commercial, industrial, recreational, or residential project of more than four units which is subject to the provision of access shall be required to provide access improvements commensurate with the project size and access demand. Such improvements shall be outlined in the conditions of the project permit.

        2.     Design and construction of access improvements shall consider maintenance, safety, potential vandalism and protection of fragile coastal resources.

        3.     Upon completion and acceptance of access improvement construction such improvements shall be dedicated to the city for public use. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

        E.     Stormwater quality. All applicable projects shall treat storm water runoff to reduce suspended solids. The treatment shall be equal to that obtainable by the detention of the twenty-four-hour design storm runoff. In addition to the requisite analyses, site design, and treatment methods to be incorporated into specific development project types identified in Chapter 17.84B, the design storm for treatment facilities shall be the “eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour storm” for volume based designs and the “eighty-fifth percentile one-hour storm” for flow based designs. Surface water runoff shall be determined using the “Rational Method” with runoff coefficients and rainfall intensities as set forth below.

        1.     The runoff formula shall be:

Q = CiA

where Q = flow (cubic feet/second)

C = runoff coefficient (dimensionless)

I = rainfall intensity (inches/hour)

A = contributing area

        2.     The following shall be used as the runoff coefficient (C) in the design of drainage facilities and structures:

        a.     For impervious areas (roofs, pavement, etc): 1.00

        b.     For pervious areas: 0.40

        c.     The rainfall intensity for a “ten-year storm” shall be determined from the following formula: log I = 0.83 - 0.46(log t), where t = the time of concentration

        d.     The “twenty-five-year storm” is twenty-nine percent larger than the “ten-year storm” and the “one-hundred-year storm” is sixty-one percent larger than the “ten-year storm.”

        e.     The time of concentration shall be determined by assuming that overland runoff travels at one foot/second on pervious surfaces and two feet/second on impervious surfaces. The runoff travel rate for flow in streets, storm drains, and other drainage structures shall be as determined by calculation.

        f.      For design of water quality related structures the “eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour storm” shall be 0.130 inches and the “eighty-fifth percentile one-hour storm” shall be 0.2 inches with a factor of safety of two x, for a total of 0.259 inches. (Ord. of 2-22-2011(1))

17.90.010 Purpose and intent.
        The purpose of regulating the sale of alcohol is to ensure the compatibility of such uses with surrounding uses and properties and to avoid any negative impacts associated with such uses. Therefore, in order to protect and preserve the public health, safety and welfare, the city council has determined that special regulations, review of proposed business operations, and approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission is necessary. (Ord. No. 784, § 8, 4-20-2015)

 

17.90.020 Definitions.
        As used in this chapter, the following words and phrases are defined as follows:

        A.    “Alcohol” means any bottled or prepared beverage with more than one-half of one percent alcohol content per volume. This includes any beer, wine, wine cooler, frozen mixed drink, hard alcohol or spirits, liqueur or any other variation of a drink with alcoholic content.

        B.     “Convenience Stores” means a retail store of three thousand five hundred square feet or less in gross floor area that carries a range of merchandise oriented to daily convenience and travelers’ shopping needs. Convenience stores also include establishments that sell motor vehicle fuels.

        C.     “Liquor Store” means a retail store primarily engaged in the sale of alcohol.

        D.    “On-Sale Alcohol” means any drink served and/or prepared at the site with the intent of buying and drinking at this same site. This includes any bar or any bar affiliated with a restaurant.

        E.     “Off-Sale Alcohol” means any drink served at a site with the intention of buying the drink there and taking it somewhere private to drink.

17.90.030 Review Process.
        Before the opening of a new business, extending the hours of operation of any establishment that sells or serves any alcoholic beverage, or adding to the capacity, floor area or shelf space devoted to alcoholic beverages of any establishment that sells or serves any alcoholic beverages, the applicant must first obtain a conditional use permit from the planning commission. Conditions of approval will vary with each application including location, on-sale or off-sale business, public convenience and necessity, and any other, city, state, and federal laws that may apply. The criteria that will be followed to approve the conditional use permit are as follows:

        A.    Conditional Use Permit. The planning commission must review all conditional use permit requests for proposed alcohol sales. The following information must be provided to the planning commission to approve conditional use permit requests:

        1.     A list of all establishments within a one thousand-foot radius with similar size and array of products, if there is any other establishment, other than a food service establishment with incidental service of beer and/or wine within a one thousand-foot radius of the site of the proposed use that is in the same category of alcoholic beverage sales or service and the State Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control finds that the request will result in an overconcentration of alcohol sales within the applicable census tract, then the planning commission may not approve the application unless it makes all of the findings of “public convenience or necessity”;

        2.     The number of businesses having authority to sell alcoholic beverages in the census tract of the subject site;

        3.     The extent to which the crime reporting district in which subject site is located exceeds the average for crime reporting districts subject to the jurisdiction of the police department;

        4.     The proximity of the subject site to school, park, playground, recreational center, day care, or similar use.

        B.     Public Convenience or Necessity. A determination of public convenience or necessity (PCN) is required by the department of alcoholic beverage control (ABC) when there is an overconcentration of alcohol sales licenses within a defined census tract. ABC determines if there is an overconcentration of licenses in a census tract and will require a determination of public convenience or necessity from the city. The planning commission must make a PCN determination prior to consideration of a conditional use permit to allow alcohol sales.

        C.     PCN Findings. To approve a PCN determination, the following findings must be made:

        1.     The proposed establishment will promote the city’s economic health, consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan policies to further district purposes;

        2.     The applicant has not operated a licensed establishment, which has been the subject of verified complaints, or violations regarding alcohol, public safety or nuisance statutes or regulations;

        3.     The police department has reported that the proposed establishment would not be expected to add to crime in the area;

        4.     Alcoholic beverages sold by the applicant are incidental to the other products available for sale at the establishment.

        D.    Commercial Zones. The sale of alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption may only be allowed by conditional use permit in the following zones: C-l, C-2 and CW.

        E.     Distance consideration. The planning commission may take into consideration the proximity of the proposed alcohol retailer with parcels occupied by the following uses:

        5.     Residential uses.

        F.     Revocation of Use Permit. If any of conditions are found to be disregarded, the use permit for alcohol sales will be subject to revocation. If necessary, the planning commission may modify the use permit after holding a noticed public hearing and making applicable findings.

        G.    Optional Conditions. Further conditions may be imposed upon the issuance of a use permit for on-sale or off-sale liquor establishments. (Ord. No. 784, § 8, 4-20-2015)

Chapter 17.92 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
17.92.010 Purpose.
        The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures, and to establish relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests. (Ord. No. 790, § 3, 12-7-2015)

        In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, any person may request a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of his or her choice. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This Chapter applies only to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. (Ord. No. 790, § 3, 12-7-2015)

 

17.92.030 Application requirements.

        1.     Applicant’s name and contact information;

        2.     Property address;

        3.     Current use of the property;

        4.     Basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under Fair Housing Laws;

        5.     The zoning code provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested;

        6.     Explanation why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual; and 7. Plans showing the details of the proposal.

        B.     If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval under this Title (including but not limited to a conditional use permit, architectural control, variance, or zoning amendment), the application for reasonable accommodation must be submitted and reviewed at the same time as the related applications. (Ord. No. 790, § 3, 12-7-2015)

 

17.92.040 Review authority.
        A.    If an application under this Chapter is filed without any accompanying application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this Title, the Community Development Director will make a written determination within forty-five days of submission of the application and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation.

        B.     If an application under this Chapter is filed with an application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this Title, it will be heard and acted upon at the same time and in the same manner as such other application, and will be subject to all of the same procedures. (Ord. No. 790, § 3, 12-7-2015)

 

17.92.050 Findings and decision.
        A.    Any decision on an application under this Chapter must be supported by written findings addressing the criteria set forth in this subsection. An application under this Chapter for a reasonable accommodation will be granted if all of the following findings are made:

        1.     The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual who is deemed disabled under either the Federal Fair Housing Act or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

        2.     The requested reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual who is deemed to have a disability under either the Federal Fair Housing Act or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

        3.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city.

        4.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning.

        5.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not adversely impact surrounding properties or uses.

Chapter 17.93 STANDARDS FOR MARIJUANA
17.93.010 Legislative findings and statement of purpose.
        A.    The City Council finds that the prohibitions on marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, and marijuana dispensaries are necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare for the City and its community. The cultivation, dispensing, delivery, manufacture and other use of marijuana negatively impacts, or has the potential to negatively impact, the health, safety and welfare of the community and public within the City. These negative impacts include, but are not limited to, damage to buildings in which cultivation, manufacturing and dispensing occurs, including improper and dangerous electrical alterations and use, inadequate ventilation, increased occurrences of robberies and similar crimes, and nuisance impacts to neighboring properties from the strong and potentially noxious odors from the plants and increased crime. The City Council’s prohibition of such activities is within the authority conferred upon the City Council by State law.

        B.     The City Council finds that the public health, safety and general welfare of the City and its residents necessitates and requires the adoption of this zoning ordinance, prohibiting the establishment, maintenance and operation of marijuana cultivation, marijuana deliveries, marijuana dispensaries, cooperatives, and collectives, and other uses involving distribution of marijuana and marijuana related products, in order to: (a) protect and safeguard against the detrimental secondary negative effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing marijuana; (b) preserve and safeguard the minors, children and students in the community from the deleterious impacts of marijuana related facilities; and (c) preserve the City’s law enforcement services, in that monitoring and addressing the negative secondary effects and adverse impacts will likely burden the City’s law enforcement resources. The City Council further finds that due to negative secondary effects and adverse impacts of facilities and other locations cultivating, delivering and/or dispensing marijuana, the establishment and operation of these facilities and land uses will negatively impact the City.

        C.     On October 9, 2015, the Governor signed the “Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act” (“Act”) into law. The Act becomes effective January 1, 2016 and contains new statutory provisions that:

        1.     Allow local governments to enact ordinances expressing their intent to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana and their intent not to administer a conditional permit program pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana (Health & Safety Code § 11362.777(c)(4));

        2.     Expressly provide that the Act does not supersede or limit local authority for local law enforcement activity, enforcement of local ordinances, or enforcement of local permit or licensing requirements regarding marijuana (Business & Professions Code § 19315(a));

        3.     Expressly provide that the Act does not limit the authority or remedies of a local government under any provision of law regarding marijuana, including but not limited to a local government’s right to make and enforce within its limits all police regulations not in conflict with general laws (Business & Professions Code § 19316(c)); and

        4.     Require a local government that wishes to prevent marijuana delivery activity, as defined in Business & Professions Code section 19300.5(m) of the Act, from operating within the local government’s boundaries to enact an ordinance affirmatively banning such delivery activity (Business & Professions Code § 19340(a)).

        D.    The City Council finds that this chapter: (1) expresses its intent to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana in the City and to not administer a conditional permit program or any other permitting program pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana in the city; (2) exercises its local authority to enact and enforce local regulations and ordinances, including those regarding the permitting, licensing, or other entitlement of the activities prohibited by this chapter; (3) exercises its police power to enact and enforce regulations for the public benefit, safety, and welfare of the city and its community; and (4) expressly prohibits the delivery of marijuana in the city.

Chapter 17.94 CANNABIS CULTIVATION FOR PERSONAL OR MEDICAL USE
17.94.010 Findings.
        A.    The city of Crescent City and other public agencies have reported adverse impacts from cultivation, including, but not limited to: disagreeable odors negative effects on physical, mental, and community health; violation of building codes and other land development codes; increased risk of burglary and other property crimes; and acts of violence in connection with the commission of such crimes or the occupants’ attempts to prevent such crimes.

        B.     The creation of persistent strong odors as cannabis plants mature and flower is offensive to many people, results in complaints of respiratory problems, and generally creates an attractive nuisance by alerting persons, including children, to the location of valuable cannabis plants and creating an increased risk of crime.

        C.     Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use, and the presence of cannabis plants is an attractive nuisance for children, creating an unreasonable hazard in areas frequented by children including schools, parks, and other similar locations. Further, the potential for criminal activities associated with cannabis cultivation in such locations poses heightened risks that children will be involved or endangered.

        D.    The indoor cultivation of substantial amounts of cannabis within a residence presents potential health and safety risks to those living in the residence, especially children, including, but not limited to, increased risk of fire from grow light systems; potential adverse effects on the structural integrity of a building; exposure to fertilizers, pesticides, and anti-fungus/mold agents; and exposure to potential property crimes targeting the residence.

        E.     The production of concentrated cannabis and extraction of compounds from cannabis using alcohol or flammable liquids or gases has caused numerous fires and explosions throughout California causing injury to both people and property.

        F.     The right of qualified patients and their primary caregivers under state law to cultivate cannabis plants for medical purposes does not confer upon them the right to create or maintain a public nuisance. By limiting the cultivation area for indoor medical cannabis cultivation to a single space no larger than fifty square feet in a single room and limiting cannabis plants to a single layer, the city anticipates a reduction in the negative secondary effects of unfettered growing such as odor, fire, crime, and pollution.

        G.    Limiting the area of indoor cultivation to fifty square feet is necessary because the lights and electricity required by cultivation areas larger than fifty square feet are likely to exceed the wattage supported by a typical household light and receptacle circuit, thereby creating an unreasonable risk to public health, safety, and welfare and a public nuisance through the hazard of fire and overloading of circuits.

        H.    Prohibiting the outdoor cultivation of cannabis is necessary because outdoor cannabis cultivation would create an unreasonable risk of causing a public nuisance.

        I.      Limiting the number of medicinal cannabis plants or medicinal cannabis cultivation space available to a qualified patient or primary caregiver is not intended to preclude a qualified patient or primary caregiver from obtaining through dispensaries, collectives, or other legal means additional medicinal cannabis that the qualified patient needs for his or her reasonable medical use.

        J.      Limiting the number of personal cannabis plants cultivated indoors for personal use and the total wattage of lights used for cultivation is necessary because cultivating cannabis plants in excess of six plants and with unlimited total wattage would create an unreasonable risk of fire danger caused by high-wattage grow lights and excessive use of electricity.

        K.    Requiring indoor cultivation to be secured in a locked space increases the possibility that cannabis grown for purposes that are legal under state law remains secure and will not be distributed to minors or in illicit markets.

        L.     By limiting the amount of medicinal cannabis that a qualified patient or primary caregiver may possess to up to eight ounces, or the amount that is reasonably related to the qualified patient’s current medical needs, the city seeks to reduce the harms that come with possession of larger amounts, including illegal sales, accompanying crimes, and illegal cultivation practices.

        M.    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to implement state law by providing a means for regulating the cultivation of medicinal and personal use cannabis in a manner that is consistent with state law and which balances the needs of medical patients and their caregivers and the interests of personal use cultivators, while promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the residents and businesses within the incorporated city of Crescent City. This chapter is intended to prohibit the cultivation of cannabis by anyone for any purpose other than by a qualified patient, primary caregiver, or personal use cultivator cultivating in strict compliance with this chapter, and applicable state law. This chapter is not intended to prohibit persons from exercising any right otherwise granted by state law, including, but not limited to, Proposition 215, Senate Bill 420, Proposition 64, and Senate Bill 94. Rather, the intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable regulations upon the manner in which cannabis for medicinal or personal purposes may be cultivated, including restrictions on the amount of cannabis that may be cultivated in any location or premises, in order to protect the public health and safety.

        N.    The limited right of qualified patients and their primary caregivers and personal use cultivators under state law to cultivate cannabis plants for medicinal purposes or personal use does not confer the right to create or maintain a public nuisance. By adopting the regulations in this ordinance, the city will achieve a significant reduction in the aforementioned harms caused or threatened by unregulated cultivation of cannabis in the city of Crescent City.

        O.    Nothing in this chapter may be construed to allow the cultivation of cannabis for purposes other than medicinal and personal use, or allow any activity relating to the cultivation, distribution, or consumption of cannabis that is illegal under state law. (Ord. 803 § 3, 2018)

Chapter 17.95 COMMERCIAL CANNABIS REGULATIONS
17.95.010 Purpose and findings.
        A.    Purpose. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare through strong and effective regulatory and enforcement controls, to protect neighborhood character, and to minimize the potential negative impacts of commercial cannabis activity on people, communities, and the environment by establishing minimum land use controls. Within the Downtown Business (C-1) District, General Commercial (C-2) District, Waterfront Commercial (CW) District, and Highway Services (HS) District, commercial cannabis activity, as defined under Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code, may be permitted with a use permit, subject to the regulations governing the underlying zoning district, and the requirements set forth in this chapter.

        B.     Findings. The city council makes the following findings:

        1.     While cannabis is now legal in California for adult use (age twenty-one and older), it is still illegal for minors (under age twenty-one) to use and possess non-medicinal cannabis. The potential negative impacts on the health of minors and the intoxicating effects of cannabis justify regulations that help to: (a) keep cannabis out of the hands of minors; and (b) minimize the promotion of cannabis use in a manner that is directed or appealing to minors.

        2.     Commercial cannabis businesses are attractive targets for burglaries and robberies. Therefore, it is prudent to impose security requirements and other regulations on businesses that are aimed to provide a base level of protection against such thefts. Burglaries and robberies not only impact the business owner but also employees, patrons, the public, and law enforcement.. (Ord. 819 § 7, 2020)

 

17.95.020 Interpretation and applicability.
        A.    No part of this chapter is to be deemed to conflict with federal law as contained in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 800 et seq., nor to otherwise permit any activity that is prohibited under that Act or any other local, state, or federal law, statute, rule or regulation.

To achieve this, the area where cannabis activities capable of generating odors are conducted (e.g., cultivation, processing, manufacturing, testing, etc.), must be, at a minimum, mechanically ventilated with a carbon filter or other method to prevent the odor of cannabis from escaping the building and negatively impacting neighbors and the surrounding community. The ventilation and filtration system must be approved by the building official and installed prior to commencing cannabis activities within the structure. Failure to adequately control odors constitutes a public nuisance and subject to nuisance abatement procedures found in Title 8 of the Crescent City Municipal Code. Odor control issues may also be grounds for revocation of the use permit allowing commercial cannabis activity.

Security measures must include, but are not limited to, the following:

        a.     Prevent individuals from loitering on the premises of the retailer if they are not engaging in activity expressly related to the operations of the retailer;

        b.     Establish limited access areas accessible only to authorized dispensary personnel;

        c.     All cannabis facilities containing cultivation, processing, non-volatile manufacturing, and distribution are required to have a mantrap at the public entrance to the building. A mantrap is a small room with an entry door on one wall and an exit door on the opposite wall. Mantraps are used to separate non-secure areas from secure areas to prevent unauthorized access;

        d.     Store all cannabis goods in a secured and locked safe room, safe, or vault, and in a manner as to prevent diversion, theft, and loss, except for limited amounts of cannabis goods used for display purposes, samples, or immediate sale; and

        e.     Install security cameras on site.

        17.   The permittee is required to notify the Crescent City Police Department and the licensing authority within twenty-four hours after discovering any of the following:

        19.   To ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, an onsite compliance inspection may be conducted, with at least twenty-four hours prior notice, by appropriate city officials during regular business hours (Monday – Friday, nine a.m. – five p.m.). Appropriate city officials include those officials identified in Section 17.95.150 of this chapter.

        D.    Before the planning commission approves any use permit for commercial cannabis activity, the planning commission must hold a public hearing, noticed pursuant to Government Code Section 65091, make the following findings, and set forth the facts supporting its determination in writing:

        1.     The applicant has demonstrated that it can and will comply with all requirements of the state and city to operate the proposed commercial cannabis activity.

Section 8-216 Classification plan.
        A.    Preparation or Revision. The city manager will ascertain and record the duties and responsibilities of all positions in the service of the city, and after consultation with the appointing authorities, other affected officials and affected employee organizations, will recommend a classification plan for such positions or matters relating to the classification plan. The classification plan will consist of the job titles and job descriptions for all city positions. The classification plan will be so developed and maintained that all positions substantially similar with respect to duties, responsibilities and other like characteristics of work are included within the same job title. When, in the case that the duties of a position have changed materially so as to necessitate reclassification, the position will be allocated to a more appropriate job title whether new or already created in the same manner as originally classified and allocated. The duties of the job title will also be redescribed should the duties of the position change materially. Reclassification will not be used for the purpose of avoiding restrictions regarding demotions and promotions. No person will be appointed to any position unless said position has been incorporated in the classification plan as provided by these rules.

        B.     Adoption or Amendment—Effect. Classification plan or any part thereof will be established by the city manager; provided, however, that prior to the city manager’s consideration, the classification plan or any amendment will be approved and recommended by the employee’s department head. The department head’s recommendations will contain a list of duties, authorities, responsibilities and working conditions of the positions in the classification plan to determine common job titles. Prior to the city manager’s approval of the classification plan or any amendment thereto, a copy of the proposed amendment will be distributed to the affected employee organizations and posted on the appropriate departmental bulletin board. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-217 Selection Procedures.
        A.    Application and Applicants.

        1.     Announcement. Notice of vacancies for all positions in the classified service will be given by the preparation of employment opportunities announcements. The announcements will be posted in the city hall, and may further be posted, distributed or advertised in such a manner for the city manager will to yield maximum effectiveness and benefit to the city in securing the largest number of qualified applicants. The announcement will specify the position, title and pay range of the position for which the examination is announced, the nature of the work to be performed, minimum and desirable qualifications, the date, time, place and manner of making applications, the closing date for receiving applications, the types of tests to be administered in the examination, and other pertinent information.

        2.     Application Forms. Applications will be made on forms provided by the city manager. All applications must be signed by the person applying.

        3.     Disqualification. The city manager may reject any application which indicates on its face that the applicant does not possess the minimumqualifications required for the position. Such minimum qualifications may include physical or psychological requirements if they are bona fide occupational qualifications for the position to which the applicant seeks appointment. An applicant may be rejected from an employment list if the applicant has made any false statement on the application on any material fact, or has practiced or attempted to practice any deception or fraud on his application. Whenever an application is rejected, notice of such rejection will be mailed to the applicant by the city manager.

        B.     Examinations.

        1.     Subject and Methods of Examinations. Examinations may be assembled, unassembled, written, oral, practical demonstration, or in any other combination which will evaluate fairly the qualifications of applicants. In whatever form the examination takes, it will relate to job responsibilities for the position and will be structured fairly to measure the applicant’s capability to perform in the position. Examinations may consist of one or more of the following parts:

        a.     Performance Tests. The performance test is that part which deals with the duties of a position, and is designed to test the ability of an individual to perform those duties. Example: The practical test of driving or typing.

        b.     Written Test. The written test is that part which examines the knowledge and training which forms the basis for performing the duties of the position.

        c.     Application Evaluation Test. The application evaluation test is that part which reviews the applicant’s training and experience as measured in relation to the minimum qualifications of the position and those of other applicants, through an analysis of application forms. Recommendations provided by references indicate the character of past employment, sobriety and general standing in the community as related to the requirements of the job may be included as part of this evaluation.

        d.     Physical Agility, Medical or Psychological Tests. A physical agility, medical and/or psychological examination or test may be required of any position.

        e.     Personal Interview Test. The applicant may be questioned on the duties of the position, training and experience, the nature of work previously performed, and other occupational qualification questions in order to determine the applicant’s fitness for the position.

        2.     Conduct of Tests. The city manager will administer such tests as are appropriate and will arrange for the use of public building, materials, and equipment for the conduct of tests. All tests will be held unless no qualified applicants are available for testing.

        3.     Qualifying Grade. In all tests the minimum grade or standing for which eligibility may be earned will be based upon all factors in the test, including educational requirements, experience, occupational qualifications of the position, and other test validity studies. Failure in one test of an examination may be grounds for declaring that an applicant has failed the entire examination or is disqualified for subsequent parts of an examination.

        4.     Notification of Results. Each applicant taking an examination will be given written notice of the results thereof and of the applicant’s final rating and, if successful, of the applicant’s relative position on the subsequent eligible list. An error in grading or rating, if called to the attention of the city manager within ten days after notification of the results of the examination, will be corrected and appropriate changes to any eligibility list made. Corrections will not, however, invalidate a certification or appointment previously made. In promotional examinations applicants may be provided an analysis of their test results of only written standardized tests.

        5.     Review of Examination Contents. City will receive and review any and all comments offered by applicants concerning the examinations, their validity, and any other comments the applicant desires to offer.

        C.     Eligible Lists.

        1.     Employment. As soon as possible after the conclusion of an examination the city manager will prepare and keep available a list of names of persons successful in the examination. The final rating will be determined by the total of the scores received by each applicant for each test of the examination based upon the relative value assigned to each test. Applicants achieving identical final ratings will be ranked numerically in an alphabetical order by last name.

        2.     Reemployment Lists. Employees laid off under the provisions of subsection E of Section 8-218 of these rules will be placed on a reemployment list in the order of layoff. Employees who have resigned in good standing upon their request at the time of termination of employment will be placed on reemployment list for positions for which they are qualified following the names of employees laid off. Employees who resign and so request placement on the reemployment list(s) will be placed on the list(s) in the order, most to least, of the number of years in the position covered by the list.

        3.     Duration. Employment lists will become effective upon the approval of the city manager and upon certification that the same were properly prepared and represent the relative ratings of the names appearing thereon. Employment lists will remain in effect for one year and may be extended by action of the city manager for additional six month periods, but in no event will an employment list remain in effect for more than two years. Reemployment lists will remain in effect for a period not less than one year and so long as the employment list for the same position remains active.

        4.     Removal of Names from Eligible List. Candidates will be notified during examinations that their names will be removed from an employment list by the city manager:

        a.     If the candidate requests in writing that candidate’s name be removed;

        b.     If the candidate fails to respond to a notice of certification mailed to the candidate’s last known address;

        c.     If the candidate, having been certified for appointment three times, has not been appointed;

        d.     Or, if the candidate is no longer qualified for the position. The candidate affected will be notified of the removal by notice mailed to candidate’s last known address. The names of candidates listed on a promotional basis who have either resigned or are discharged from the service of the city will automatically be removed from any such lists.

        5.     Order of Precedence. The order of precedence for employment will be as follows:

        1.     Reemployment list;

        2.     Employment list.

        D.    Method of Filling Vacancies.

        1.     Types of Appointment. All vacancies will be filled by transfer, reemployment, demotion, promotion, or by candidates certified by the city manager from an eligible list, if available. If there are no eligible persons, temporary appointment may be made in accordance with this Appendix A.

        2.     Notice to City Manager. Whenever a vacancy is to be filled, the city manager will be notified. The city manager will be advised as to the availability of employees for reemployment, request for transfer or demotion, and of candidates on employment lists for the position. The names of all candidates willing to accept appointment will be certified in the order in which they appear on the eligible list.

        3.     Appointment. After interview and investigation the appointing authority will make appointments from among the top five ranked candidates, including ties, certified in compliance with this Appendix A; provided, however, that should an eligible list be certified with less than three names on it, the appointing authority may obtain a new eligible list prior to appointment of any candidate. The city manager will notify the candidate selected. If the candidate accepts the appointment and reports for duty within such period of time as the appointing authority prescribes, and provides information and material as required by the city manager, the candidate will be deemed appointed; otherwise, the candidate will be deemed to have declined the appointment. Any candidate not appointed and who has a higher ranking than the candidate appointed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection will, upon request, be provided with a statement from the appointing authority describing the employment qualifications which the candidate should attempt to strengthen in order to make him or her a more desirable candidate for employment.

        4.     Temporary Appointments. In the absence of appropriate eligible lists, a temporary appointment may be made by the appointing authority if the person appointed meets the minimum training and experience qualifications for the position. An eligible list will be established within three months for any permanent position filled by temporary appointment. A temporary appointment may not exceed three months; provided, however, that the city manager may extend the period for any temporary appointment to a temporary position for not more than ninety additional days. No credit will be allowed in meeting any qualification or in the giving of any test or in the establishment of any eligible list for services rendered under a temporary appointment.

        5.     Civil Defense and Disaster —Emergency Appointments. City’s office of emergency services may make emergency appointments without regard to the provisions of this Appendix A. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-218 Employment status.
        A.    Probationary Period.

        1.     Objective. The probationary period will be regarded as a part of the examination process and will be utilized for closely observing the employee’s work, for securing the most efficient training in adjustment of a new employee to the position, and for rejecting any probationary employee whose performance is below average or unsatisfactory.

        2.     Regular Appointment Following Probationary Period. All appointments will be subject to a probationary period of six months; provided, however, that the city manager may extend the probationary period for any given job title not to exceed an additional twelve months upon finding that length of the initial probationary period in relation to training and other requirements of the position is insufficient to evaluate adequately a probationary employee’s fitness. Employees serving their probationary periods at the time an extension for the job title is made will not have their probationary periods extended. Nothing contained herein will prohibit a department head from requesting an individual extension of a probationary period in place of termination.

        3.     Probationary Reports. Employee performance reports for probationary employees will be prepared at three month intervals through the entire probationary period. These reports will be submitted to the city manager on a prescribed form and will be filed for permanent record. Each report will be discussed with the employee and may be signed by the employee at that time and a copy will be given to the employee. If employee refuses to sign the performance report, said report will be annotated to that effect and placed in the employee’s personnel file.

        4.     Rejection—Nonpromotional. During the probationary period an employee may be rejected at any time by the appointing authority. A probationary employee so rejected will not have the right to appeal such rejection or to file a grievance relating thereto. Notification of rejection in writing will be served upon the probationary employee seven days prior to the discharge date, except in the case of an emergency, and a copy will be filed with the city manager as soon as possible.

        5.     Rejection—Promotional. Any employee rejected during the probationary period following a promotional appointment will be reinstated to the position from which the employee was promoted.

        B.     Transfer. An employee may be transferred at either the employee’s request or at the discretion of the appointing authority at any time from one position to another position in the same comparable class. If the transfer involves a change from the jurisdiction of one department or office to another, the prior consent of the head of each department or office will be required unless the appointing authority orders the transfer for the purposes of economy or efficiency. Transfer will not be utilized to effectuate promotion, advancement, reduction, or disciplinary action. No employee will be transferred to a position for which the employee does not possess the minimum qualifications. If an employee isinvoluntarily transferred, the employee may file a grievance to appeal such transfer, in the manner as provided by this Appendix A.

        C.     Promotion. Vacancies may be filled by promotion from within the classified service or by open competitive examination. Appropriate examinations will be used to develop an eligible list for determining qualified promotional candidates. The decision as to whether a particular examination will be on a competitive or on a promotional basis will be made by the city manager, based upon the determination as to how best the position can be filled to satisfactorily meet the needs of the service.

        D.    Demotion.

        1.     Except as provided in Section 8-220, demotion is a disciplinary action available to the appointing authority.

        2.     Upon request of the employee, and with the prior consent of the prospective department or office head, demotion may be made to a vacant position.

        3.     No employee will be demoted to a position for which the employee does not possess the minimum qualifications.

        E.     Layoff. An appointing authority may lay off an employee in the classified services as dictated by the needs of the service as determined by the appointing authority. Employees within a classified service job title affected by a layoff will be laid off in an inverse order based upon a rating derived as follows: An employee will be rated based upon the employee’s length of service (one point for each year) plus skills (one point for each six months of outstanding employment). On or before the pay period next preceding the effective date of the layoff, the appointing authority will notify the affected employee(s). If service has been satisfactory, the name of the employee(s) laid off will be placed on the appropriate reemployment list as provided by these rules.

        F.     Resignation. An employee wishing to resign in good standing will file with the employee’s supervisor at least two weeks before leaving the service a written resignation stating the effective date and reasons for leaving. Failure to comply with this rule will be entered on the service record of the employee and may be cause for denying future employment by the city. The resignation will be forwarded by the supervisor, through the department head, to the city manager with a statement by the appointing authority or department head as to the resigned employee’s service performance and other pertinent information concerning the cause for resignation. An employee who fails to give notice of resignation will be reported to the city manager by the department or office head immediately, and is not eligible for reemployment. An employee who leaves the service in good standing may request reemployment rights through the city manager as described by this Appendix A. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-219 Pay.
        The manner and method of pay for employees is prescribed in the annual budget of the city and/or duly adopted memoranda of understanding, If, in the case the employee’s probationary period is extended as provided by this Appendix A, an employee will nonetheless be eligible for pay advancement at the expiration of the initial probationary period, if such pay changes are provided by the annual budget of the city and/or memoranda of understanding affecting the employee’s job title. Such pay change will be effective only after the department head has certified that the employee has performed satisfactorily during the initial probationary period. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

        A.    Applicability.

        1.     Notice of the proposed action and of the grounds for such action;

        2.     A written copy of the charges and grounds for such charges;

        3.     A reasonable time to answer the charges, not to exceed fifteen days;

        4.     A written decision on such answer at the earliest practicable date, not to exceed fifteen days following the answer.

        H.    Status of Employee During Notice Period. Except as otherwise provided, an employee against whom disciplinary action is proposed is entitled to be retained in an active status during the notice period. When circumstances are such that the retention of the employee in an active status in the employee’s position may result in damage to city property or may be detrimental to the interests of the city or injurious to the employee, fellow workers or the public, the appointing authority may temporarily assign the employee to duties in which these conditions do not exist or place the employee on paid suspension.

        I.      Notice of Decision. Any employee against whom disciplinary action is pending is entitled to notice of the appointing authority decision at the earliest practicable date, not to exceed fifteen days following the answer. The appointing authority will deliver the notice of decision to the employee at or before the time when the action will be effective. If discipline is to be imposed, the notice will be in writing, be dated and inform the employee of the following:

        1.     Which of the reasons in the notice of proposed disciplinary action have been sustained and not sustained;

        2.     Of the right to appeal the notice of decision, as provided in this section, if and only if such disciplinary action results in discharge, demotion or suspension. The employee will have no such right to appeal if the disciplinary action is with a written reprimand or a verbal reprimand. However, the employee may provide a written response to the reprimand and the response will be placed in employee’s personnel file;

        3.     Of the time limit for such appeal, if after notice and answer the appointing authority decides not to discipline the employee, the employee will be notified within fifteen days following the answer. A decision not to discipline will be accompanied by a directive to the city manager to delete all reference to the pending action from the employee’s personnel file.

        J.      Appeal of Disciplinary Actions.

        1.     If, pursuant to the provisions of subsection I of this section, an employee appeals the notice of decision, a hearing officer will be named to hear the matter.

        2.     The hearing authorized herein will be held within thirty days following the request for hearing.

        3.     Whenever a hearing on any disciplinary action is to be held, the city manager will notify the person requesting the hearing and the appointing authority from whose action the appeal is being taken, of the date, time and place of the hearing and will publicly post a notice of the date, time and place of hearing on the public bulletin board in the City Hall.

        4.     The hearing may be public or closed, at the employee’s option.

        5.     a.     The employee requesting the hearing will be required to appear at the hearing.

        b.     The employee requesting the hearing may be represented by any person.

        c.     Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the employee and city’s representative, during the hearing any and all witnesses to be called by either the employee or city will be excluded from the hearing room unless actually testifying; provided, that both the employee and city may designate a person, who will not be subject to the exclusion, who has investigated the matter at issue in the hearing and whose assistance during the hearing is necessary to the efficient conduct of the hearing.

        6.     The hearings will proceed generally as follows:

        a.     The city’s representative and the affected employee may make opening statements.

        b.     The city’s representative will present oral and/or documentary evidence in support of city’s position; the affected employee may cross-examine any witness called by city.

        c.     The affected employee may present evidence in employee’s own behalf; the city’s representative may cross-examine such witnesses.

        d.     Both the city and the affected employee may subpoena witnesses and present rebuttal evidence.

        e.     The hearing officer will rule on any objections made to the admissibility of evidence or otherwise relating to the conduct of the hearing. Such rulings will be final.

        f.      The city’s representative and the affected employee may make closing statements.

        7.     Hearing Officer’s Action.

        a.     Upon the conclusion of any investigation or hearing, the hearing officer will cause findings and recommendations to be prepared in writing and will certify the same within twenty days.

        b.     The hearing officer will, at a minimum, find whether the city has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the charges in support of the disciplinary action have been substantiated. Such a finding will be made as to each charge. If the hearing officer finds that none of the charges are supported by the evidence presented, the recommendation will be that no disciplinary action be taken. If the hearing officer finds that any or all of the charges are supported, the hearing officer will either:

        i.      Recommend that the proposed disciplinary action be carried out;

        ii.     Recommend such other disciplinary action deemed appropriate under the circumstances;

        iii.    Recommend that no disciplinary action be taken.

        c.     The hearing officer’s findings and recommendations will be filed as a permanent record with the city manager and will be signed by the city manager. The city manager will deliver a certified copy of such findings and recommendations to the appointing authority and to the employee affected by such findings and recommendations, or from whose action the appeal was taken.

        8.     If, due to any cause, a hearing cannot be held and an employee is subsequently denied such hearing within the time stated herein, action will be deferred until a hearing can be scheduled, provided, that the provisions of subsection H of this section will apply.

        9.     The appointing authority will review the findings and recommendations, the record of the hearing and any other information submitted in writing by the employee, and will then determine in light of such record and other information supplied by the employee whether the disciplinary action in the notice of decision (subsection I of this section) is proper. If it is determined that the action is proper, the employee will be notified in writing and no further action will be necessary. If it is determined that the action is not proper, the actions will be rescinded and steps necessary to adjust the employee’s records and pay to reflect such rescission will be taken. Nothing herein will be construed to preclude the appointing authority from imposing a less severe disciplinary action than that imposed under subsection B of this section, following review of the records. For this purpose, the order of severity, from most severe to least, will be as listed in subdivisions 1 through 5 of subsection B of this section. (Ord. 811 § 2, 2019; Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-230 Incompatible outside employment.
        A.    General Prohibition. No officer or employee of the city will engage in any employment, activity, or enterprise for compensation of any kind or character which is inconsistent, incompatible, or in conflict with his or her duties as an officer or employee of the city or the duties, functions or responsibilities of his or her appointing power of the city itself.

        B.     Definition of Employment Activities. For the purpose of this section, an employment activity or enterprise is inconsistent, incompatible, or in conflict with those various duties, functions or responsibilities set forth above if it:

        1.     Involves the use for private gain or advantage of the city’s time, facilities, equipment or supplies; the badge, uniform, prestige or influence of the city (except in special programs authorized and approved by the city); or

        2.     Involves receipt or acceptance by an officer or employee of the city of any money or other consideration from anyone other than the city for the performance of an act which the officer or employee, if not performing such act, would be required or expected to render in the regular course of his or her duties as a city officer or employee; or

        3.     Involves the performance of an act in other than his or her capacity as an officer or employee of the city which act may later be subject directly or indirectly to the control, inspection, review, audit or enforcement of any other officer, employee or elected official of the city; or

        4.     Involves such time demands as would render performance of duties as a city officer or employee less efficient.

        C.     City Manager’s Approval. No permanent officer or employee of the city will be gainfully employed at any employment activity or enterprise outside of city service without prior approval from the city manager. If the city manager seeks such approval for him or herself, it will be reviewed by the city council.

        D.    Administrative Procedure. Procedures and guidelines for application for approval as well as a listing of those occupations, activities and enterprises prohibited pursuant to subsection B of this section will be set out in administrative procedures available to any and all officers and employees.

        E.     Grandfather Protection.

        F.     Grievance Authority. Any person dissatisfied with a decision of the city manager under this section may request a hearing regarding the decision before a hearing officer selected in a manner provided in subsection J of Section 8-220. The following will apply to said hearings:

        2.     The employee may be represented by any person;

        3.     The employee and the city manager may present testimony and documentary evidence in support of their respective positions;

        4.     At the close of the hearing, and in no event more than ten days following the conclusion, the hearing officer will prepare findings, conclusions and recommendations regarding the propriety of the city manager’s decision; and

 

        5.     The findings, conclusions and recommendations will be forwarded to the city manager who, within ten days of receipt of same, will either confirm or reverse the decision of the hearing officer. The city manager’s action will be final. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

Section 8-250 EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION RULES.
Section 8-251 General provisions.
        A.    Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Section 8-250 is to implement Chapter 10, Division 4, Title 1 of the Government Code of the state (Section 3500 et seq.), captioned “Public Employee Organizations,” and known as the Meyers-Milias-Brown (MMB) Act, by providing orderly procedures for the administration of employer-employee relations and for the resolutions of disputes regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment within the scope of representation.

        B.     Employee Rights. Employees of the city will have the right to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their choice for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations within the definition of the scope of representation. Employees of the city also have the right to refuse to join or participate in the activities of employee organizations, and have the right to represent themselves individually in their employment relations with the city. No employee will be interfered with, intimidated, restrained, coerced or discriminated against by the city or by any employee organization because of an employee’s exercise of these rights.

        C.     City Rights. The rights of the city include, but are not limited to:

        1.     The exclusive right to determine the mission and organization of its constituent departments, offices, commissions, and boards;

        2.     Set goals and standards of services;

        3.     Determine the standards of selection for employment and promotion;

        4.     Direct its employees;

        5.     Take disciplinary action;

        6.     Relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work, funds, or for other legitimate reasons in accordance with applicable law and rules;

        7.     Maintain the efficiency of governmental operations;

        8.     Determine the methods, means and personnel by which government operations are to be conducted, including the contracting and/or subcontracting of work;

        9.     Determine the goals and objectives, and minimum qualifications of job positions;

        10.   Take all necessary actions to carry out its mission in emergencies;

        11.   Exercise complete control and direction over the organization and technology of performing work.

        D.    Access to Work Locations. Reasonable access to employee work locations will be granted officers of recognized employee organizations and their officially designated representatives. This access is for the purpose of processing grievances or contacting members of the organization concerning business within the scope of representation. Such officers or representatives will not enter any work location without the consent of the head of that department or office. Access will be restricted to prework time, lunch or after work hours so as not to interfere with the normal operations of the department or with established safety or security requirements. Solicitation of membership and activities concerned with the internal management of an employee organization, such as collection dues, holding membership meetings, campaigning for office, conducting elections and distributing literature, will not be conducted during working hours, nor with the use of city facilities or equipment, except as provided below.

        E.     Use of City Facilities. Employee organizations may be granted the use of city facilities during nonworking hours for meetings of city employees, provided space is available; and such meetings are not used for membership drives of city employees. All requests will be in writing and will state the purpose of the meeting. A copy of the meeting agenda will be furnished to the city manager as soon as it is available, but no less than twenty-four hours prior to such meeting. The city may assess reasonable charges for the use of such facilities in accord with any applicable administrative procedure regarding the particular facility. The use of city equipment other than items normally used in the conduct of business meetings, such as desks, chairs, ashtrays, and blackboards, is prohibited, the presence of such equipment in approved city facilities notwithstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, recognized employee organizations may use any city facility open to the public for any lawful purpose upon application to the city clerk.

        F.     Use of Bulletin Boards. Recognized employee organizations may use portions of city bulletin boards under the following conditions:

        1.     All material must be dated and identify the organization that published them.

        2.     The city reserves the right to determine what portion of the bulletin boards are to be allocated to employee organization materials.

        3.     The city manager may remove materials which are considered disruptive to the city services.

        4.     Unless otherwise agreed upon, materials posted will be removed thirty-one days after posting.

        5.     An employee organization that does not abide by these rules will forfeit its right to have materials posted on city bulletin boards.

        G.    Availability of Data. The city will make available to employee organizations such nonconfidential information pertaining to employment relations as is contained in the public records of the agency, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this rule and Government Code Sections 6250 through 6260. Such information will be made available during regular office hours in accordance with the city’s procedures for making public records available and after payment of reasonable costs for reproduction and labor. Information which will be made available to employee organizations includes regularly published data covering subjects under discussion. Data collected on a promise to keep its source confidential may be made available in statistical summaries, at the discretion of the city, but will not be made available in such form as to disclose the source.

        H.    Peaceful Performance of City Services.

        1.     If a recognized employee organization, by and through its authorized representatives, officers, or agents, causes, instigates, encourages or condones a strike or a work stoppage of any kind, in addition to any other lawful remedies or disciplinary actions, the city manager:

        a.     May revoke or suspend, subject to the right of organization to appeal the suspension or revocation to the city council at its next regular or adjourned regular meeting, the recognition granted to such employee organization;

        b.     May suspend or cancel any or all payroll deductions payable to such organizations;

        c.     May prohibit the use of city facilities;

        d.     May prohibit access to former work or duty stations by such organization. The city will not prohibit employees from entering their job sites for the purpose of performing their jobs in accordance with city rules and regulations.

        2.     As used in this section “strike or work stoppage” means the concerted failure to report for duty, the unexcused absence from one’s position, the stoppage of work, or the abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful performance of the duties of employment for the purpose of inducing, influencing, or coercing a change in the conditions of compensation, of the rights, privileges or obligations of employment.

        3.     Any decision of the city manager made under the provisions of this section may be appealed to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk. The notice will be accompanied by a complete statement setting forth all of the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Such notice of appeal must be filed within seven days after the affected employee organization first receives notice of the city manager’s decision. Failure to file within the stated period will be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal and waiver of any and all future rights with respect thereto. If an appeal is filed, the council will hear the matter and issue a decision as soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five days following the filing of the notice of appeal.

        I.      Dues Deduction.

        1.     Only a recognized employee organization may be granted permission to have the regular dues of its members deducted from their paychecks, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the city manager.

        2.     Dues deduction will be made only upon the voluntary written authorization of the employee, on a form provided by the city. Dues deduction authorization may be cancelled and the dues deduction from payroll discontinued at any time by the employee upon voluntary written notice to the finance director unless otherwise provided. Dues deduction may continue only upon voluntary written authorization of the member for a period of time not to exceed the time period as provided in a memoranda of understanding. Employee payroll deduction authorizations will be in uniform amounts to each employee for dues deductions and paid only to one employee organization for each employee.

        3.     The employee’s earnings must be sufficient to pay the dues deductions after other legal and required deductions are made. All other legal and required deductions have priority over employee organization dues. When an employee, who is a member in good standing of the formally recognized employee organization, is in a leave without pay (LWOP) status for an entire pay period, no dues withholding will be made to cover that pay period from future earnings nor will the employee deposit the amount with city which would have been withheld if the employee had been in a paid status during that period. In the case of an employee who is in a LWOP status during only part of the pay period, and the salary is not sufficient to cover the full withholding, no deduction will be made. The city will have no liability whatsoever of any kind or character regarding dues deduction relative to an employee who has insufficient net earnings remaining after all legal and other required deductions to pay the authorized dues deduction or who has no earnings by virtue of being on leave without pay status.

        4.     Dues withheld by the city will be paid monthly on or before the fifteenth day of the month next following the month in which the dues were deducted. A check will be prepared and payable to the organization by the officer designated in writing by the organization as authorized to receive such funds and at the address specified.

        5.     All employee organizations who receive dues deductions will indemnify, defend and hold the city harmless against any claims made and against any suit instituted against the city on account of deduction of employee organization dues. In addition, all such employee organizations will refund forthwith to the city any amounts paid to it in error upon presentation of supporting evidence. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-252 Recognition provisions.
        A.    Recognition Proceedings.

        1.     Request for recognition as the majority representative:

        a.     An employee organization that seeks recognition as the majority representative in an appropriate unit will file a petition for recognition with the city manager containing all of the information set forth herein, accompanied by written proof that at least fifty percent of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relation with the city. Upon receipt of the petition for recognition, the city manager will determine:

        i.      That there has been compliance with the requirements of the petition for recognition; and

        ii.     Determine the appropriateness of a unit. If an affirmative determination is made by the city manager on the foregoing two matters, the manager will give notice of such request for formal recognition to the employees in the unit and will take no action on said request for thirty days thereafter; if either of the foregoing matters are not affirmatively determined, the city manager will inform the employee organization of the reasons in writing.

        B.     Petition for Recognition Requirements. The petition for recognition to be filed with the city manager will contain the following information and documentation:

        1.     Name and address of the employee organization;

        2.     Names and titles of its officers;

        3.     Name(s) of employee organization representatives) who are authorized to speak on behalf of its members;

        4.     A statement that the employee organization has, as one of its primary purposes, the representation of employees in their employment relations with the city;

        5.     A statement as to whether or not the employee organization is a chapter or local of, or affiliated directly or indirectly in any manner with a regional, state, national or international employee organization, or union, and, if so, the name and address of each such regional, state, national or international employee organization or union;

        6.     Certified copies of the employee organization’s constitution and bylaws and articles of incorporation;

        7.     A designation of a person, and their address, to whom notice sent by regular United States mail will be deemed sufficient notice to the employee organization for any purpose;

        8.     A statement that the employee organization recognizes that the provisions of Section 923 of the Labor Code are not applicable to city employees, and a statement that the organization agrees to comply with the provisions of this Appendix A;

        9.     A statement that the employee organization does not discriminate or restrict membership or participation based on race, color, age, national origin, sex, ancestry, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation, disability, or marital status.

        10.   The job titles, names, and office or departmental affiliation of member employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate;

        11.   A statement that the employee organization has in its possession written proof; dated within two months of the date upon which the petition is filed, to establish that employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate, have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city. Such written proof will be submitted for confirmation to the city manager;

        12.   A request that the city council recognize the employee organization as the majority representative of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate for the purpose of meeting and conferring in good faith on all matters within the scope of representation;

        13.   All petitions, including accompanying documents, will be verified, under oath, by at least two officers of the organization that the statements are true and that the signatures are authorized and valid. All changes in such information will be filed, forthwith, in like manner.

        C.     Determining Appropriateness of Units.

        1.     The city manager, after reviewing the petition filed by an employee organization seeking formal recognition as majority representatives, will determine whether the proposed unit is an appropriate unit. The principle criterion in making this determination is whether there is a community of interest among such employees. The following criteria, among others, are also to be considered in making such determination:

        a.     The history of employee relations:

        i.      In the unit,

        ii.     Among other employees of the city, and

        iii.    In similar public employment;

        b.     The effect of the unit on the efficient operation of the city and sound employer-employee relations;

        c.     The extent to which employees have functional relationships, common skills, working conditions, job duties;

        d.     The effect on the existing classification plan of dividing a single class among two or more units. Preference will be given to the largest possible class consistent with criteria listed herein.

        2.     In the establishment of appropriate units, professional employees will not be denied the right to be represented separately from nonprofessional employees. Management and confidential employees will not be included in the same unit with nonmanagement or nonconfidential employees.

        3.     Police department employees who are “Peace officers,” as that term is defined in Chapter 4.5, commencing with Section 830, of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code of the state, may join or participate only in an employee organization which is composed solely of such peace officers, which concerns itself solely and exclusively with the wages, hours, working conditions, welfare programs, and advancement of the academic and vocational training in furtherance of the police profession, and which is not subordinate to any other organization.

        4.     No employee may be represented by more than one recognized employee organization for the purposes of this Appendix A.

        5.     Notwithstanding any provisions provided herein, the city retains the right to communicate with unrepresented employees or groups of employee individuals concerning wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.

        D.    Recognition Proceedings and Election.

        1.     Within thirty days of the date notice of employees is given, any other employee or organization (hereinafter referred to as the “challenging organization”) may seek formal recognition in an overlapping unit by filing a petition for recognition, provided that such challenging organization submit written proof that it represents at least fifty percent of the employees in such unit. The city manager will hold a hearing on such overlapping petitions, at which time all affected employee organizations will be heard. Thereafter, the city manager will determine the appropriate unit or units as between such proposed overlapping units in accordance with the criteria as set forth herein.

        2.     If the written proof submitted by the employee organization in the unit found to be appropriate establishes that it represents more than seventy percent of the employees in such unit, the city manager may, in his discretion, certify to the city council that formal recognition should be granted to such employee organization without a secret ballot election.

        3.     When an employee organization in the unit found to be appropriate submits written proof that it represents at least fifty percent of the employees in such unit, and it does not qualify for, or has not been granted, recognition pursuant to subdivision 2 of subsection D of this section, the city manager will arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted by the city clerk or the State Conciliation Service. All challenging organizations who have submitted written proof that they represent at least thirty percent of the employees in the unit found to be appropriate, and have submitted a petition for recognition as required by this section, will be included on the ballot. The choice of “no organization” will be included on the ballot. Employees eligible to vote in such election will be those persons regularly employed in permanent, full-time positions within the unit who were employed during the pay period immediately prior to the date which is fifteen days before the election, including those who did not work during such period because of illness, vacation, or authorized leaves of absence and who are employed by the city in the same unit on the date of the election. An employee organization will be granted recognition following an election or run-off election if the employee organization has received the vote of a numerical majority of all the employees eligible to vote in the unit in which the election is held (i.e. fifty percent plus one of the votes of all eligible employees). In an election involving three or more choices, where none of the choices receives a majority, a runoff election will be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of valid votes cast. The rules governing an initial election will also apply to a runoff election.

        E.     Impasse in Representation Proceedings. Any unresolved complaint by an affected employee organization, advanced in good faith, concerning a decision of the city manager made pursuant to Section 8-252 will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8-254 and must be filed with the city manager within seven days after the affected employee organization first receives notice of the decision upon which its complaint is based, or its complaint will be considered closed and not subject to the impasse procedures or to any other appeal.

        F.     City Council Recognition of Majority Representative.

        1.     After the city manager has determined the majority representative of city employees in an appropriate unit by arranging for a secret ballot election as prescribed herein or by any other reasonable method which is based upon written proof; and is designated to ascertain the free choice of a majority of such employees. The manager will:

        a.     Certify to the city council the choice of the majority of the employees or the name of the employee organization found to represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit;

        b.     Not preclude any recognized employee organizations, or individual employees, from consulting with management representatives on employer-employee relation matters of concern to them.

        2.     The city council will:

        a.     Grant formal recognition to the employee organization certified by the city manager as found to represent the majority of the employees in an appropriate unit and will be the only employee organization entitled to meet and confer in good faith on matters within the scope of representation for employees in such unit;

        b.     Revoke the recognition rights of a majority representative, which has been found by a secret ballot election no longer to be the majority representative.

        G.    Duration of Recognition. When an employee organization has been recognized, such recognition will remain in effect until such time the city manager determines, on the basis of a secret ballot election in accordance with the foregoing rules, the employee organization no longer represents the majority of the employees and the affected unit; provided, a memorandum of understanding, if any, negotiated by such a decertified employee organization will remain in full force and effect until the expiration date provided in the existing memorandum, the city will have no obligation to negotiate a new memorandum of understanding as to any employees within the newly certified employee organization until such expiration date.

        H.    Decertification of Recognized Organization.

        1.     A petition for decertification alleging that an employee organization granted formal recognition is no longer the majority representative of the employees in an appropriate unit may be filed with the city manager. The petition for decertification may be filed by an employee, a group of employees or their representative, or an employee organization. The petition including all accompanying documents, will be verified, under oath, by the person signing it, that its contents are true. It may be accompanied by a petition for recognition by a challenging organization. The petition for decertification will contain the following information:

        a.     The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and/or a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information;

        b.     The name of the formally recognized employee organization;

        c.     All allegations that the formally recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, and any other relevant and material facts;

        d.     Written proof that at least fifty percent of the employees in the unit do not desire to be represented by the formally recognized employee organization. Such written proof will be dated within three months of the date upon which the petition is filed and will be submitted for confirmation to the city manager.

        2.     The city manager will arrange for a secret ballot election to be administered by the city clerk or the State Conciliation Service, to determine if the recognized employee organizations will retain its recognition rights.

Section 8-253 Dispute resolution provisions.
        A.    Grievances.

        1.     Purpose of Procedures. The purposes of this section are as follows:

        a.     To promote improved employer-employee relationships by establishing a grievance procedure on matters for which appeal is not otherwise provided;

        b.     To afford individual employees a systematic means to obtain future consideration of problems after every reasonable effort has failed to resolve them through discussion. Nothing herein will preclude an employee from being represented by another individual or employee organization in the grievance procedure;

        c.     To provide that grievances will be settled as near as possible to the point of origin;

        d.     To provide that the grievance procedure will be as informal as possible.

        2.     Availability of Procedures. These grievance procedures will be available only to permanent employees and permanent classified management employees, as defined herein.

        3.     Matters Subject to Grievance Procedures. A grievance may concern a dispute regarding the interpretation or application of any ordinance, rule or regulation governing personnel practices or working conditions within the scope of representation; provided, a grievance brought hereunder may not concern a matter which an individual employee or an employee organization would be precluded from bringing under the provisions of an existing memorandum of understanding.

        4.     Grievance Procedure. Grievance will be processed in accordance with the following procedures:

        a.     Informal Procedure. Any employee having a grievance will first discuss their grievance with their immediate supervisor within five working days of the occurrence which caused the grievance. Within five working days after the discussion the supervisor will attempt to resolve the grievance.

        b.     Formal Procedure. If the supervisor’s action does not satisfactorily adjust the grievance, the employee may, within five working days of the supervisor’s response, take the following steps:

        i.      First Level of Review. A grievance may be submitted in writing to the employee’s immediate supervisor. The written grievance will be specific and include all facts deemed pertinent to its resolution. The immediate supervisor will discuss the grievance with the employee and/or the employee’s representative, if any, and reply in writing to the employee within five working days;

        ii.     Second Level of Review. If the employee does not agree with the decision of the second level supervisor, the written grievance will be submitted to the department head within five working days after receipt of the second level supervisor’s decision. After receipt of the grievance, the department head will have fifteen working days to schedule such investigation as he deems necessary and will render a written decision;

        iii.    Hearing Request. Should the employee still be aggrieved, the employee may appeal the decision within ten working days of receipt of the written decision. The hearing officer will be appointed and a hearing held both in the manner provided in subsection J of Section 8-220;

        iv.    Grievance of City Manager Action. In the case where the city manager is the first supervisor, the grievance will be submitted directly to a hearing officer for review and consideration. The grievance will follow the normal course thereafter.

        c.     General Provisions. The following provisions will apply to the grievance procedure:

        i.      Departments with only one supervisor being the department or office head, then the first level will be omitted.

        ii.     Each level of supervision has an obligation to respond to any grievance, but should a response not be rendered within the time limit, the employee filing the grievance may immediately appeal in writing to the next step.

        iii.    The grievance is considered settled if the decision of any step is not appealed within the time limit, except when an investigative process is still in progress and the employee has been notified that it is taking place and the employee agrees to extend the time period.

        iv.    Any time limit in the grievance procedure may be extended to a date mutually consented to by the employee or employees filing the grievance and the supervisor involved.

        v.     Supervisors will not take any action against employees who avail themselves of the grievance procedure.

        vi.    An employee may use vacation time or compensatory time off, if reasonably necessary, for the preparation of a grievance. If the grievance is sustained by the city manager, such time taken will be recreated to the employee.

        B.     Grievance Hearings.

        All hearings conducted under these grievance provisions by an assigned hearing officer will be private unless otherwise requested by the employee. Upon conclusion of a hearing, the hearing officer will prepare findings and recommendations which will be submitted to the city manager. The city manager will, within fifteen days, make a decision and issue an order on the matter. The city manager’s decision and order will be final. All materials relating to any grievance including, but not limited to, minutes of the hearing; findings and recommendations and the final decision and order will be available to the city council. At the request of the employee, for the purpose of information only, a copy of the final decision and order of the city manager will be furnished to the city council. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)

 

Section 8-254 Meet and confer provisions.
        A.    Meeting and Conferring in Good Faith —Memoranda of Understanding.

        1.     Pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code, Section 3500 et seq., as said sections apply to city, city, through its designated representatives, will meet and confer in good faith with representatives of recognized employee organizations regarding matters within the scope of representation.

        2.     The city will not be required to meet and confer in good faith on any matter preempted by federal or state statute; nor upon any provision of the municipal code or rules or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto which do not fall within the scope of representation. Further, the city will not be required to meet and confer in good faith regarding city rights as defined herein. City will consult in good faith as to those matters specified in California Government Code Section 3507.

        3.     When a recognized employee organization is meeting and conferring or consulting with the city’s authorized representative, all communications by the recognized employee organization representative regarding the negotiations will be with the city’s authorized representative and all city communications will likewise be sent to the organization’s designated representative. Unless otherwise agreed by city’s authorized representative and the recognized employee organization representatives, all such communications will be confidential.

        4.     When the meet and confer, or consult process is included between the city and a recognized employee organization representing a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit, all agreed upon matters will be incorporated in a written memorandum of understanding signed by the duly authorized city and majority representatives. The memorandum of understanding will be submitted to the city council for determination and implementation on matters over which the council has authority. A memorandum of understanding will not be binding on the city or the recognized employee organization until approved by the city council.

        B.     Resolution of Impasses; Impasse Procedures.

        1.     Initiation. If the possibility of settlement by direct discussion has been exhausted after a reasonable number of meetings and attempts to conclude an agreement, any party may initiate impasse procedures by filing with the other party or parties a written request for an impasse meeting, together with a statement of its position on all disputed issues. An impasse meeting will then be scheduled by the city manager forthwith after the date of filing of the written request for such meeting, with written notice to all parties affected. The purpose of such impasse meeting will be:

        a.     To permit a review of the position of all parties in a final effort to reach agreement on the disputed issues; and

        b.     If agreement is not concluded, to discuss the selection of a mediator from the State Conciliation Service.

        2.     Mediation. If the parties fail to conclude an agreement at the impasse meeting, the impasse may be submitted to mediation. The parties will provide to the mediator written statements outlining their relative positions on the remaining disputed issues. The mediator will conduct all meetings and discussions in private and will make no public statements or recommendations concerning the issues. Neither party to the mediation will make any public statement regarding any aspect of the mediation. The making of such a statement will be deemed an unfair labor practice and will constitute grounds for allowing the other party to withdraw from mediation.

        3.     Selection of Mediator and Costs. The parties will mutually agree upon a mediator available through the State Conciliation Service. If the parties fail to so mutually agree, the State Conciliation Service will assign a mediator. Should a mediator not be available from the State Conciliation Service, the parties will mutually agree upon a mediator from some other source. In no event will the city be obligated for costs of any mediation services.

        4.     Conclusion of Mediation. If, after thirty days following commencement of mediation, the city and the recognized employee organization again fail to conclude an agreement, the city may act unilaterally on any disputed issues. In the alternative, upon mutual consent of both parties the issues may be submitted to additional impasse procedures including, but not limited to, fact-finding.

        5.     Fact-finding. If the parties agree to fact-finding, a fact-finding panel of three will be appointed in the following manner: one member to be appointed by the city manager, one member to be appointed by the recognized employee organization, and those two appointed members will appoint a third, who will be chairman. If they are unable to agree upon a third, they will select by agreement the third from a list to be provided by the State Conciliation Board.

        C.     Advance Notice and Reasonable Time Off to Meet and Confer.

        1.     Reasonable written notice will be given to each recognized employee organization affected, of any ordinance, rule, resolution or regulation directly relating to matters within the scope of representation, proposed to be adopted or amended, and each will be given the opportunity to meet with the city’s representative. In cases of emergency, when an ordinance, rule, resolution or regulation must be adopted immediately without prior notice or meeting with a recognized employee organization, such notice and opportunity to meet will be provided at the earliest practicable time following the adoption of such ordinance, rule, resolution or regulation.

        2.     The recognized employee organization may select not more than three employee members of such organization to attend scheduled meetings with the city’s representatives on subjects within the scope of representation during regular work hours without loss of compensation. Where circumstances warrant, the city manager may approve the attendance at such meetings of additional employee representatives with or without loss of compensation. The employee organization will, whenever practicable, submit the names of all such employee representatives to the city manager at least two working days in advance of such meetings; provided further:

        a.     That no employee representative will leave their duty or work station or assignment without specific approval of the city manager; provided, that such approval will not be unreasonably withheld;

        b.     That any such meeting is subject to scheduling in a manner consistent with operating needs and work schedules of the city.

        Nothing herein will limit or restrict the scheduling of meetings at mutually agreeable times before or following regular duty or work hours. Employees involved in such meetings, during their regular work hours, will not be required to make up the time so spent. No overtime payments will be authorized or made for such time spent in such meetings. (Ord. 705 Appx. A, 2004)
