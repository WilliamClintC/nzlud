ordinance, that if any part of the ordinance be held unconstitutional the
remaining parts shall remain in force, unless the ordinance provides
otherwise, or unless the remaining parts are so essentially and inseparably
connected with and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is
apparent that Council would not have enacted the remaining parts without the
unconstitutional part, or unless the remaining parts, standing alone, are
incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the intent of

unchanged with respect to an amendment which is repealed at the same meeting
of Council which enacted the amendment.

any offense committed against a former ordinance, nor as to any act done, or
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, except that the proceedings thereafter had shall
conform, so far as practicable, to the laws in force at the time of such
proceedings.  If any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any
provision of the new ordinance, such provision may, by the consent of the
party affected, be applied to any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance
takes effect.

Council, or a certain city officer or employee, to make additional ordinances
or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the intent of the ordinance,

effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain

add, or repeal a chapter, section, or division:

to be consistent with the meaning or legal effect of the questions of the
subject matter taken as a whole.

meaning can be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or
words was clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be
corrected, and the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will
conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same

regarding the nature or extent of such error.

§ 30.01  DEFINITIONS.



   As used in this title, unless the context otherwise requires, the
following definitions shall apply:



   CODE OF ORDINANCES.  A re-enactment of the body of positive municipal
law, read and interpreted as a whole, with the text arranged by subject
matter and properly indexed.



   COMPOSITE INDEX.  A loose-leaf compilation of all ordinances listed by
date of passage, arranged by subject matter of the contents and indexed
alphabetically.



   MUNICIPAL ORDER.  An official act of the City Council which is binding
upon the officers and employees of the municipality and any governmental
agency over which the municipality has jurisdiction.



(KRS 83A.010(9))



   OFFICER.  Any person elected to a position by the voters or any person
appointed to a position which:



   (A)   Is created by the Constitution, the general assembly, or the
city:



   (B)   Possesses a delegation of a portion of the sovereign power of
government;



   (C)   Has powers and duties to be discharged which are conferred
directly or by implication of the city;



   (D)   Has duties performed independently and without control of a
superior power other than law;



   (E)   Has some permanency;



   (F)   Requires an official oath;

the body.

§ 34.14  REMOVAL.



   (A)   Grounds.  No member of the Police or Fire Department shall be
removed from the department or reduced in grade on any reason except
inefficiency, misconduct, insubordination, or violation of law, or violation
of the rules adopted for the departments.



   (B)   Filing of charges.  Any person may prefer charges against a
member of the Police or Fire Departments, which must be filed in the office
of the Mayor, who shall thereupon communicate the charge without delay to the
City Council.  The charges must be written, signed by the person making such
charges and must set out with clearness and distinctness each and every
charge.  It shall be the duty of the Mayor and the Council, whenever
probable cause appears, to prefer charges against any member of the Police or
Fire Departments, whom, he or she believes to have been guilty of any conduct
justifying his or her removal or punishment in the interest of public
order.  The charges thus filed shall be written and shall set out with
sufficient specificity so as to fully inform the officer of the nature and
circumstances of the alleged violation in order that he or she may be able to
properly defend himself or herself. All investigations of any complaint
against a member of the Police Department and any charge of disciplinary
proceeding relating thereto shall be in accordance with KRS 15.520 as same

Department shall be held in accordance with KRS 15.520 as same may be
amended. Unless waived in writing by the charged officer, any accused officer
of the Police or Fire Department shall be given at least twelve days’
written notice of any hearing. The notice shall be served on the officer by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery. The notice
shall state the date, time and place at which and when the hearing of the
charges shall begin. The person accused may, however, in writing, waive the
service of the charges. Upon the filing of the charges, the City Council
shall proceed to hear and examine the charges. The Council will have the
power to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses at all hearings or
sittings, by the body, on subpoena issued by the Madisonville City Clerk, and
served on the witnesses by any officer authorized to serve subpoenas from any
court of justice in the county.  If any witness fails to appear in response
to a subpoena or refuses to testify concerning any matter on which he may
lawfully be interrogated, any district court judge, on application of the
Council may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of
disobedience of a subpoena issued from the district court.



   (D)   Rights of accused.  The member of the Police or Fire
Department, the accused, shall have the right to have subpoenaed, in his or
her behalf, any witness he or she may desire, on furnishing their names to
the Madisonville City Clerk, and the action and decision of the Council on
the charges shall be reduced in writing and shall be entered in a book to be
kept for that purpose by the Council, and the written charges filed in this
matter shall be preserved and securely attached to the book containing the
Council’s decisions.



   (E)   Suspension pending hearing.  In cases where the Mayor or
Chief has a probably cause to believe that a member of the Police or Fire
Department has been guilty of any conduct justifying removal or punishment,
he or she may suspend the member from duty, or from both pay and duty,
pending the trial, and the member shall not be placed on duty or allowed pay
thereafter until the charges are heard by the Council.



   (F)   Penalties.  The Council shall fix punishment against a member
of the Police or Fire Departments found guilty of any charge under this
subchapter, by reprimand or suspension for any length of time in their
judgment, not to exceed six months or by reducing the grade, if the accused
by Chief or other officer, or by combining any two or more of the
punishments, or by removal or dismissal from the service of any such member
of the Police or Fire Department, except as provided in this subchapter, no
member shall be reprimanded, removed, suspended, or dismissed from the
Department until written charges have been made, or preferred against him or
her, and a trial had as herein provided.

§ 34.15  APPEAL PROCEDURES.



   (A)   As provided by law, any member of the Police or Fire
Departments who shall be found guilty by the City Council of any charge as
hereinbefore provided, may bring action in Hopkins Circuit Court.



   (B)   On the request of the part accused, the Madisonville City
Clerk shall file a certified copy of the charges made and the judgment or the
findings of the body in the circuit court; which transcript, having been
filed, the cause shall be docketed in the circuit court and tried de novo by
the judge of the court.



   (C)   Should the Madisonville City Clerk fail to certify and
transmit the transcript aforesaid to the circuit court within five days after
the request is made for same, then the party aggrieved may file an affidavit
in the circuit court, setting out as fully as possible the charges made, the
time of trial by the court and the judgment of the body, together with the
statements of facts that the demand for transcript has been made on the
Madisonville City Clerk more than five days before the filing of the
affidavit.



   (D)   As provided by law, on the filing of the affidavit in the
Hopkins Circuit Court, said cause shall be docketed in the court and the
circuit court is authorized to compel the filing of the transcript by the
Treasurer by entering the proper mandatory orders, and by fine and
imprisonment, as in cases of contempt.  Such appeal shall have precedence
over other business and be taken up and determined speedily.

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS



§ 40.05  INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.



   (A)   As defined in § 40.01, and subject to the limitations set
forth in § 40.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records
of the city shall make a request or complete a written application for such
records at the office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except
during legal holidays.  The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or
sent via facsimile to the City Clerk office.



(KRS 61.872 (2))



   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in
compliance with the open records law and the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection.  Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of
the City Clerk for the inspection.  No person shall remove original copies
of public records from the offices of any public agency without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record.



(KRS 61.872(1))



   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular
business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from
the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or principle place of
business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has
precisely described public records which are available within the city.  If
the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.



(KRS 61.872(3)).



   (D)   The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the
public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by
this chapter.  When copies are requested, the custodian may require a
written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
40.01.



   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public
records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy
format where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. 
Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records to electronic
formats.



   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as
not less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white
paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.  If the public agency
maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this
format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be
provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified
by the public agency.  Any request for a public record in a form other than
the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.



(KRS 61.874(1))



   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency
from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial
purpose may require a certified statement from the requestor stating the
commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may require the
requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract shall permit
use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a specified
fee.  The fee may be based on the cost to the public agency of media,
mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy of the public
record or records or the cost to the public agency of the creation purchase,
or the acquisition of the public records.



(KRS 61.874 (4))



   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part
of a public record for a:



      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial
purpose, if a certified statement from the requestor was required by the
public agency pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or



      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or



      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.  A newspaper,
periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have used or
knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose
merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its
express permission for that commercial use.



(KRS 61.874 (5))



   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as
provided under this section, may be provided and made available at the
discretion of the public agency.  If a party wishes to access public records
by electronic means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a
public agency may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or
other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. 
Fees shall not exceed:



      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and
reasonable cost of computer time access charges;



      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a
reasonable fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).



(KRS 61.874(6)) (Am. Ord. 2013-13, passed 7-15-13)



§ 40.06  REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.



   If the City Clerk does not have custody or control of the public record
or records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.



(KRS 61.872(4)) (Am. Ord. 2013-13, passed 7-15-13)



§ 40.07  PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.



   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant
and shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public
records, not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of
the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date
on which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.



(KRS 61.872(5))



§ 40.08  REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.



   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records.  However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.



(KRS 61.872(6))



§ 40.09  TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.



   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made
under this chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request
whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the person
making the request within the three-day period of its decision.  Any agency
response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall include
a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of the
record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld.  The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under
the official custodian's authority and shall constitute final agency action.



(KRS 61.880)



   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review
the denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed
under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's
request, the agency will provide additional documentation.



   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute
appeal proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory
relief in the circuit court.  In addition, if the Attorney General disallows
the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding
the Attorney General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes
proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of
such action.



(KRS 61.880, 61.882)



§ 40.10  CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.



   No official or employee of the city shall willfully conceal or destroy
any record with the intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or these
rules and regulations.



§ 40.11  ACCESS TO RECORDS RELATING TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

which he is mentioned by name, upon presentation of appropriate
identification, subject to the provisions of this chapter.

§ 40.12  PUBLIC RECORDS PROTECTED FROM DISCLOSURE.



   (A)   The following public records are excluded from the application
of this chapter and these rules and regulations, and shall be subject to
inspection only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction, except that
no court shall authorize the inspection by any party of any materials
pertaining to civil litigation beyond that which is provided by the Rules of
Civil Procedure governing pretrial discovery:



      (1)   Public records containing information of a personal
nature where the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.



      (2)   Records confidentially disclosed to an agency and
compiled and maintained for scientific research.  This exemption shall not,
however, apply to records the disclosure or publication of which is directed
by other statute.



      (3)   (a)   Upon and after July 15, 1992, records
confidentially disclosed to an agency or required by an agency to be
disclosed to it, generally recognized as confidential or proprietary, which
if opened would permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors of the
entity that disclosed the records.



         (b)   Upon and after July 15, 1992, records
confidentially disclosed to an agency or required by an agency to be
disclosed to it, generally recognized as confidential or proprietary, which

administration of a loan or grant; (ii) in conjunction with an application
for or the administration of assessments, incentives, inducements, and tax
credits as described in KRS Chapter 154; (iii) in conjunction with the

These exemptions shall not, however, apply to records the disclosure or
publication of which is directed by other statutes.



      (4)   Public records pertaining to a prospective location of a
business or industry where no previous public disclosure has been made of the
business' or industry's interest in locating in, relocating within, or
expanding within the Commonwealth.  This exemption shall not include those
records pertaining to applications to agencies for permits or licenses
necessary to do business or to expand business operations within the state,
except as provided in division (A) (3) above.



      (5)   Public records which are developed by an agency in

      (8)   Records of law enforcement agencies or agencies involved
in administrative adjudication that were compiled in the process of detecting
and investigating statutory or regulatory violations, if the disclosure of
the information would harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants
not otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a
prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication.  Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a
decision is made to take no action.  The exemptions provided by this
subdivision shall not be used by the custodian of the records to delay or
impede the exercise of rights granted by this chapter.



      (9)   Preliminary drafts, notes, or correspondence with
private individuals, other than correspondence which is intended to give
notice of final action of a public agency.

suppression, ventilation, water, wastewater, sewage and gas systems.



            6.   The following records when their disclosure
will expose a vulnerability referred to in this division:  detailed

that public agency shall forward a copy of the written denial of the request,
referred to in KRS 61.880(1), to the executive director of the Kentucky
Office of Homeland Security and the Attorney General;



         (d)   Nothing in this division shall affect the

§ 42.02  FINDINGS.



   The City Council of Madisonville, Kentucky finds and declares that:



   (A)   Public office and employment with the city are public trusts.



   (B)   The vitality and stability of the government of this city
depends upon the public's confidence in the integrity of its elected and

between the private interests and public duties of a city officer or
employee, that confidence is imperiled.



   (C)   The government of this city has a duty to provide its citizens
with standards by which they may determine whether public duties are being
faithfully performed, and to make its officers and employees aware of the
standards which the citizenry rightfully expects them to comply with while
conducting their public duties.

   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method of
assuring that standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure
requirements for officers and employees of the city shall be clearly
established, uniform in their application and enforceable, and to provide the
officers and employees of the city with advice and information concerning
potential conflicts of interest which might arise in the conduct of their
public duties.



   (B)   It is the further purpose of this chapter to meet the
requirements of KRS 65.003 as enacted by the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly.



   (C)   This chapter is intended as a minimum standard of conduct. 
It does not abrogate any stricter or higher standard established by state,
federal or local law.

minute interval of maximum use during the monthly billing period as recorded
by a demand meter and adjusted for power factor as provided below.



   (F)   Fuel Adjustment Charge.  In the event the rate under which
MMU purchases power at wholesale from its supplier is adjusted in accordance
with a fuel cost adjustment provision contained in its wholesale power
contract, an amount, sufficient to recover or account for said charge, shall
be applied per kWh of sales to MMU customers. Such amount shall be stated
separately on each bill and shall be designated Fuel Adjustment Charge.



   (G)   Customer Power Factor Billing Measurement.



      (1)   MMU installs facilities to supply power to the customer
at or near unity power factor.

result in a power factor near unity.  However, MMU will permit the use of
apparatus which shall result, during normal operation, in a power factor not
lower than ninety percent (90%) either lagging or leading.



      (3)   Where the customer's power factor is less than ninety
percent (90%), MMU reserves the right to require that customer to furnish at
his or her expense, suitable corrective equipment to maintain a power factor
of ninety percent (90%) or higher.  MMU also reserves the right to adjust
the maximum measured load for billing purposes when the power factor is less
than ninety percent (90%).



      (4)   The formula to be used for the adjustment of the maximum
kW load when the power factor is below ninety percent (90%) is based on the
power factor measured at the time of the maximum load and is as follows:



               Maximum Measured kW Load x 90%



      Adjusted kW Load   =   Power Factor (In Percent)



   (H)   Customer Dedicated Facility Charge.  Charges under this rate
schedule shall include a facility charge equal to one-and-one-half percent
(1.5%) of the total installed cost of dedicated electric distribution
facilities required to provide service to the Customer.  MMU will prepare
specific cost estimates on a case-by-case basis to determine the Facilities
Charge.



   (I)   Customer Minimum Charge.  The minimum monthly charge under
this schedule shall be Customer Charge plus a Customer Dedicated Facility
Charge as described above.

§ 51.15  POWER COST ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE CHARGES (PCA).



   The rate schedules in this chapter shall be subject to the power cost
adjustment clause charges in addition to the aforesaid rates.  The Power
Cost Adjustment (PCA) is expressed as dollars per kWh and is multiplied by
the energy (kWh) sold during each billing period to each customer. The PCA is
designed to be calculated monthly based on actual power costs and energy
sales for the applicable month.  The following formula shall be utilized to
calculate the PCA:



   (A)   PCA = A/B - Base Rate where.



   (B)   PCA = The cost adjustment expressed as dollars per kWh to be
multiplied by the energy (kWh) sold during each billing period to customers
on rates subject to the PCA.



   (C)   A = Actual wholesale power cost for the applicable month
(includes all wholesale power costs as billed by Kentucky Utilities).



   (D)   B = Actual energy sales from rates subject to the PCA for the
applicable month.



   (E)   Base Rate = The Base Rate is the base wholesale power cost
expressed as dollars per kWh, included in the base rates for all retail
customers.  The Base Rate for retail rates effective July 1, 2012 is forty
six and ten hundreds cents ($0.04610).

accordance with MMED's terms and conditions for providing electric service.
NEM is available only by request, and on a first-come, first-served basis up
to a cumulative capacity of one percent (1%) of the MMED's single hour peak
load during the previous year. An eligible NEM customer shall mean a retail
electric NEM customer of the MIMED with a generating facility that:



         (a)   Generates electricity using solar energy or wind
energy only;



         (b)   Has a rated capacity of not greater than thirty
(30) kilowatts;

of the NEM customer's own electricity requirements.



      (2)   The term "NEM customer" hereinafter shall refer to any
NEM customer requesting or receiving NEM services in accordance with MMED's
terms and condition for providing electric service. At its sole discretion
MMED may discontinue this NEM schedule and application with ninety (90) days
written notification. MMED shall not be liable for any expense inured as a
result of the determination to discontinue this schedule.



   (C)   Metering.  MMED requires any NEM customer, who wishes to
install a generator that meets the criteria above or has been approved by
MMED for the NEM ordinance, to allow the installation of meter(s) for the
sole purpose of separately monitoring (i) the flow of power and energy, as
applicable, from MMED to the NEM customer and (ii) the flow of power and
energy, as applicable, from the NEM customer to MMED. The meter(s) will be
owned and installed by MMED in accordance with MMED's Policies and Procedures
for Electric MMED Service.



   (D)   Measurement of energy.  Energy supplied by MMED to the NEM
customer shall be determined by appropriate meter(s) located at one delivery
point. Such meter(s) shall be capable of determining energy associated with
MMED providing energy to the NEM customer under the rate schedule appropriate
for such deliveries. The energy delivered by the NEM customer to MMED shall
be metered separately for billing purposes.



   (E)   Monthly charges for delivery from MMED to the NEM customer. 
Charges for energy delivered by MMED to the NEM customer shall be determined
according to the rate schedule appropriate or applicable for the NEM customer
per MMED's standard rate classifications.  In addition to MMED's standard
rates, a second meter charge will be assessed in the amount stated below.
This meter charge will be associated with the meter measuring NEM customer
deliveries to MMED.



      Customer Meter Charge:   $50.00 per month



   (F)   Monthly credits for electrical energy delivered by NEM
customer to MMED.  An energy credit rate from MMED to the NEM customer shall
be applied to any electrical energy delivered by the NEM customer to MMED.
The NEM customer credit rate shall be equal to MMED's average per kWh
wholesale power costs as determined by summing (i) MMED's per kWh Power Cost
Adjustment (PCA) shown in MMED's Policies and Procedures plus (ii) the
wholesale power cost in MMED's base rates of $ 0.04610 per kWh, as updated
from time to time and. The monthly credit will be determined by multiplying
the per kWh energy credit rate by the monthly energy in kWhs (adjusted for
losses) delivered by the NEM customer to MMED.



   (G)   Monthly bills and credits.  For purposes of determining
monthly bills for NEM customers, the monthly credit for energy delivered by
the NEM customer to MMED will be subtracted from charges for energy delivered
by MMED to the NEM customer, if the net amount is greater than zero, then the
NEM customer will be billed for the net amount. If the net amount is less
than zero, then MMED will credit the charges to the NEM customer's bill on a
monthly basis in the amount of the total credit. MMED will read both NEM
customer meters and calculate the appropriate billing for each meter on a
monthly basis. Any credits will be carried forward to future billing cycles,
for the life of account. Under net metering MMED will not return money to the
customer for such generation.



   (H)   Application and approval process.

the following terms and conditions:



      (1)   The MMED shall provide the NEM customer metering
services through a standard kilowatt-hour metering system capable of
separately measuring (a) the power and energy, as applicable for billing
purposes, from MMED to the NEM customer the (b) the energy delivered by the
NEM customer to MMED. If the NEM customer requests any additional meter or
meters or distribution upgrades, such installations shall be at the NEM
customer's expense.



      (2)   The NEM customer shall install, operate, and maintain,
at NEM customer's sole cost and expense, any control, protective, or other
equipment on the NEM customer's system required by the MMED’s technical
interconnection requirements based on IEEE 1547, the NEC, accredited testing
laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories, and the manufacturer's
suggested practices for safe, efficient and reliable operation of the
generating facility in parallel with MMED's electric system. NEM customer
shall bear full responsibility for the installation, maintenance and safe
operation of the generating facility. Upon reasonable request from the MMED,
the NEM customer shall fully demonstrate generating facility compliance.
Should NEM customer request assistance related to the generation system
performance or safety those cost will be at the customer's expense at the
current MMED hourly rate as stated in MMED's rate ordinance.



      (3)   The generating facility shall comply with, and the NEM
customer shall represent and warrant its compliance with: (a) any applicable
safety and power quality standards established by |EEE and accredited testing
laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories; (b) the NEC as may be revised
from time to time; (c) MMED's rules, regulations, and MMED's Service
Regulations as contained in MMED's Retail Electric Ordinance as may be
revised from time to time (d) all other applicable local, state, and federal
codes and laws, as the same may be in effect from time to time. Where
required by law or regulation, NEM customer shall pass an electrical
inspection of the generating facility by a local authority having
jurisdiction over the installation.



      (4)   Any changes or additions to the MMED's system required
to accommodate the generating facility shall be considered excess facilities.
NEM customer shall agree to pay MMED for actual costs incurred for all such
excess facilities prior to construction.



      (5)   NEM customer shall operate the generating facility in
such a manner as not to cause undue fluctuations in voltage, intermittent
load characteristics or otherwise interfere with the operation of MMED's
electric system. At all times when the generating facility is. being operated
in parallel with MMED's electric system, NEM customer shall so operate the
generating facility in such a manner that no adverse impacts will be produced
thereby to the service quality rendered by MMED to any of its other NEM
customers or to any electric system interconnected with MMED's electric
system. NEM customer shall agree that the interconnection and operation of
the generating facility is secondary to, and shall not interfere with, MMED's
ability to meet its primary responsibility of furnishing reasonably adequate
service to its NEM customers.



      (6)   NEM customer shall be responsible for protecting, at NEM
customer's sole cost and expense, the generating facility from any condition
or disturbance on MMED's electric system, including, but not limited to,
voltage sags or swells, system faults, outages, loss of a single phase of
supply, equipment failures, and lightning or switching surges. Should such
condition or disturbance be determined to be NEM equipment, NEM customer
shall reimburse MMED for any and all expenses incurred to determine such
disturbance.



      (7)   After initial installation, MMED shall have the right to
inspect and/or witness commissioning tests, as specified in the Level 1 or
Level 2 Application and approval process. Following the initial testing and
inspection of the generating facility and upon reasonable advance notice to
NEM customer, MMED shall have access at reasonable times to the generating
facility to perform reasonable on-site inspections to verify that the
installation, maintenance, and operation of the generating facility comply
with the requirements of this section.



      (8)   For Level 1 and 2 generating facilities, where required
by the MMED, an eligible NEM customer shall furnish and install on the NEM
customer's side of the point of common coupling a safety disconnect switch
which shall be capable of fully disconnecting the NEM customer's energy
generating equipment from MMED's electric service under the full rated
conditions of the NEM customer's generating facility. The external disconnect
switch (EDS) location will be determined by MMED and shall be located
adjacent to MMED's meters. If the location of the EDS is not at the
customer's master meter, it shall be noted by placing a permanent sticker on
the master meter indicating the EDS location. The EDS shall be of the visible
break type in a metal enclosure which can be secured by a padlock. If the EDS
is not located directly adjacent to the master meter but at the NEM generator
meter, the NEM customer shall be responsible for ensuring that the location
of the EDS is properly and legibly identified for so long as the generating
facility is operational. The disconnect switch shall be promptly accessible
to MMED personnel at all times. In the event MMED disconnects customer
generation MMED will not be held liable for any damages or revenue loss as a
result from such disconnect.



      (9)   MMED shall have the right and authority at MMED's sole
discretion to isolate the generating facility or require the NEM customer to
discontinue operation of the generating facility if MMED believes that: (a)
continued interconnection and parallel operation of the generating facility
with MMED's electric system creates or contributes (or may create or
contribute) to a system emergency on either MMED's or NEM customer's electric
system; (b) the generating facility is not in compliance with the
requirements of this ordinance, and the noncompliance adversely affects the
safety, reliability, or power quality of MMED's electric system; or (c) the
generating facility interferes with the operation of MMED's electric system.
In non-emergency situations, MMED shall give NEM customer notice of
noncompliance including a description of the specific noncompliance condition
and allow NEM customer a reasonable time to cure the noncompliance prior to
isolating the generating facilities. In emergency situations, when the MMED
is unable to immediately isolate or cause the NEM customer to isolate only
the generating facility, the MMED may isolate the NEM customer's entire
facility. Any cost incurred by MMED as a result of the improper performance
of NEM equipment or operation shall be promptly reimbursed by NEM customer.
Any such unpaid expense shall be grounds for service termination at any of
NEM customer's facilities.



      (10)   NEM customer shall agree that, without the prior
written permission from MMED, no changes shall be made to the generating
facility as initially approved. Increases in generating facility capacity
will require a new "Application for Interconnection and Net Metering" which
will be evaluated on the same basis as any other new application. Repair and
replacement of existing generating facility components with like components
that meet UL 1741 certification requirements for Level 1 or 2 facilities and
not resulting in increases in generating facility capacity is allowed without
written approval. However, MMED must be notified to inspect the repaired
component/operation prior to continued operation. Failure to do so will
result in termination of service.



      (11)   To the extent permitted by law, the NEM customer shall
protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the MMED and its directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and contractors against and from all loss,
claims, actions or suits, including costs and attorneys fees, for or on
account of any injury or death of persons or damage to property caused by the
NEM customer or the NEM customer's employees, agents, representatives and
contractors in tampering with, repairing, maintaining, or operating the NEM
customer's generating facility or any related equipment or any facilities
owned by the MMED.



      (12)   The NEM customer shall maintain general liability
insurance coverage at all times through a standard homeowner's, commercial,
or other policy} for both Level 1 and Level 2 generating facilities. NEM
customer shall, upon request, provide MMED with proof of such insurance at
the time that application is made for net metering and provide a certificate
of liability insurance on an annual basis in accordance with City
requirements. Such certificate shall name the City of Madisonville as
"Certificate Holder". All of the policies of insurance so required to be
purchased and maintained for the certificates or other evidence thereof shall
contain a provision or endorsement that the coverage afforded will not be
cancelled, materially changed or renewal refused until at least thirty (30)
days' prior written notice has been given to the MMED by certified mail. All
such insurance shall remain in effect until written notice and verification
that NEM facilities are rendered inoperative and completely disconnected from
MMED's utility system. The limits of liability for the insurance required
above shall provide coverage for not less than the following amounts or
greater amounts where required by laws and/or regulations:



      General Liability



      Commercial General Liability (each occurrence)   $1,000,000.00

      If at any time it is determined that such insurance is invalid,
MMED shall immediately disconnect NEM from the electric distribution system.



      (13)   By entering into an Interconnection Agreement, or by
inspection, if any, or by non- rejection, or by approval, or in any other
way, MMED does not give any warranty, express or implied, as to the adequacy,
safety, compliance with applicable codes or requirements, or as to any other
characteristics, of the generating facility equipment, controls, and
protective relays and equipment.



      (14)   A NEM customer's generating facility is transferable to
other persons or service locations only after written notification to the
MMED has been made and verification that the installation is in strict
compliance with this section. Upon written notification that an approved
generating facility is being transferred to another person, NEM customer, or
location, the MMED will verify that the installation is in compliance with
this ordinance and provide written notification to the NEM customers) within
20 business days. If the installation is no longer in compliance with this
ordinance, the MMED will render it inoperative and notify the NEM customer in
writing and identify what must be done to place the facility in compliance.



   (K)   Payment.  Bills are due and payable when rendered and become
delinquent on the 15th day after the date of issue. A penalty of ten (10%)
percent may be added to all such bills. Applicable credit payments by MMED to
the NEM customer will be included in each cycle billing. Under net metering
MMED will not return money to the customer for such generation.

§ 52.16  FINDING OF FACT; BASIS OF SEWER CHARGE.



   It is determined that the most equitable, accurate and feasible method
of ascertaining and measuring use of the facility and service of the city
sewers and of designation of a charge of such use is by basing sanitary sewer
service rates and charges on the quantity of water supplied to the premises
of the respective sewer user may be achieved by establishing a minimum
monthly sewer service charge and fixing the amount of the monthly sewer
service charge at a stated percentage of the monthly water bill rendered to
the same premises and that adoption of such method will effect substantial
economic savings in preparing those bills.  Rates and charges for such use
and service are herein established based on these finding of fact subject to
exception hereinafter provided.



('74 Code, § 27-63)  (Ord. passed 3-4-74; Am. Ord. passed 9-2-86)



§ 52.17  SEWER RATES.



   Except as specifically noted herein, residential, commercial, and those
industrial customers not participating in the industrial cost recovery
program, shall pay sewage service rates based on water purchased from the
City.  Industries participating in industrial cost recovery shall be charged
on metered waste flows.  The rates and charges for sewer service furnished
by the City shall be based insofar as possible on the number of gallons of
water used in each month and are hereby fixed and established on a monthly
basis, as follows:



   (A)   (1)   All customers other than wholesale customers beyond
the City limits shall be billed seven and 75/100 dollars ($7.75) per month,
based on water usage, for each one thousand (1,000) gallons of water
consumption.  This rate consists of five and 09/100 dollars ($5.09) for
operation, maintenance and replacement (O, M & R) and two and 66/100 dollars
($2.66) for debt service.  The minimum sewer bill for all customers shall be
fifteen and 50/100 dollars ($15.50) per month, based on water usage of two
thousand (2,000) gallons (or less) in each month.



      (2)   Wholesale customers beyond the city limits shall, as a
minimum, be billed for operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the
sewer system.  The bill for wholesale customers beyond the city limits shall
be one and 95/100 dollars ($1.95) per one thousand (1,000) gallons based on
readings of a wastewater meter.  Should the existing wastewater treatment
plant located at 1000 McCoy Avenue, remain in service after said date, on
June 1, 1996, the sewer rate for wholesale customers beyond the city limits
shall be two and 50/100 dollars ($2.50) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
based on readings of a wastewater meter.



   (B)   (1)   Surcharge.  A surcharge will be levied on any
customer discharging above twenty five (25) milligrams per liter ammonia
nitrogen, two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter BOD and three hundred
(300) milligrams per liter suspended solids.  The charge will be eighty nine
cents ($0.89) per pound of ammonia nitrogen, twenty nine cents ($0.29) per
pound of BOD and eighteen center ($0.18) per pound of suspended solids.



      (2)   Method of Billing Surcharges.  The excessive strength
surcharge shall be based on the following formula, with the total applied to
the monthly bill of affected users:



      Payment ($/month)



      (A(D-250) + B(E-300) + C(F-25)) x .00834 x G = Surcharge



      Where formula components are as follows:



         (A)   Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound.



         (B)   Surcharge rate of SS, in $/pound.



         (C)   Surcharge rate for ammonia nitrogen in $/pound.



         (D)   User's average BOD concentration, in mg/l.



         (E)   User's average SS concentration, in mg/l.



         (F)   User's average ammonia nitrogen concentration, in
mg/l.



         (G)   User's monthly flow to sewage works, per 1,000
gallons.



      (3)   No reduction in sewage service charges, fees, or taxes
shall be permitted because of the fact that certain wastes discharged to the
sewage works contain less than mg/l of BOD, mg/l of SS or mg/l of ammonia
nitrogen.



   (C)   For residential, industrial, institutional and commercial
users, monthly user charges will be based on actual water usage.  If a
residential, industrial, institutional or commercial user has a consumptive
use of water, or, in some other manner, uses water which is not discharged
into the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor
may be based on readings of a wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s)
installed and maintained at the user's expense.



   (D)   Sewer rates for large consumers:



      (1)   For consumers who purchase between $4,500,000 and
7,000,000 gallons of water per month, the sewer rate for that month shall be
$6 per 1,000 gallons (one unit);



      (2)   For consumers who purchase more than 7,000,000 gallons
of water per month, the sewer rate for that month shall be $4.50 per 1,000
gallons (one unit); and



      (3)   The sewer rates set forth in this section shall not be
available to water districts, wholesale customers or municipalities.

§ 52.18  INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.



   (A)   Industries shall remit to the city, in addition to the normal
sewage service charges, the industries' share based on strength and volume of
its wastes, of the federal grant funds applied to the construction of the
sewage treatment facility and other grant applicable projects.



   (B)   Industries which are required to contribute cost recovery of
applicable costs are categorized as those industries which discharge any
waste other than normal domestic waste to the sewage system.



   (C)   Industries shall submit cost recovery payments annually for a
period not to exceed 30 years.



   (D)   Industrial cost recovery payments are based on the amount of
federal grant funds allocable to the design flow, B.O.D., and suspended
solids of the sewage treatment facility.  The design costs are divided by
the 30-year recovery period to give the cost per year.  These costs are
divided by the design daily flow, B.O.D., and suspended solids for the
year.  The addition of the elements of cost constitute the amount an
industry pays for cost recovery for the applicable year. Industry will be
responsible for monitoring its wastes in § 52.51 and submitting monthly
analyses to the Mayor.  Rates and industrial cost recovery will be based on
the industrial analyses.  Samples will be taken by the Mayor, his
representative, or duly authorized employees of the city, on an irregular
basis for the purpose of validating the results of industrial samples (see §
52.32).  If an industry does not wish to monitor its wastes, rates and
industrial cost recovery will be based on results obtained from samples taken
by the city plus a monitoring charge.



   (E)   Industrial cost recovery payments, payable to the city, shall
be collected semiannually.  However, an industry may fulfill its cost
recovery obligation by making a lump sum payment for its entire share of
project costs.  An industry shall be required to make an additional payment
over and above the lump sum if and whenever the flow or strength of its waste

shall be imposed a penalty on each bill not so paid, in an amount equal to
ten percent (10%) of the charges (other than sales tax) shown on the face
amount of such delinquent bill.  The city may serve a customer written
notice of his delinquency and of the fact that such customer is entitled, on
written request, to a hearing on the question of termination of service. If
such bill is not paid within ten days after the mailing of such notice and if
no hearing is requested, or if a hearing is requested and timely held, and
such customer's delinquency is thereby established, the city may disconnect
the water service of such customer without further notice.  If any deadline

the payment of a water or sewer bill elects not to have such water service
reconnected, or a customer who voluntarily requests that his water service be
disconnected, subsequently requests reconnection, such customer shall pay to
the city, before water service is restored to his premises, any delinquent
water or sewer bill owed by such customer, including the penalty on such
bill, plus the disconnection and reconnection charge prescribed in division
(A) of this section, plus an amount equal to the lesser of:



      (1)   The minimum monthly water (or water and sewer) rate for
each month during which such customer's service was disconnected;

wastewater containing substances regulated by this permit, to the sanitary
sewer from the permittee's facility.  In the event this should occur, the
permittee shall immediately notify the Mayor's representative (City
Engineer).  The Mayor shall have the authority to require significant
industrial users to develop a slug control plan.



      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not
amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed
or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment
plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.



      (11)   Materials discharged that are considered hazardous
waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) must be
immediately reported to the control authority.

this chapter including fines and imprisonment.  A suspended permittee shall
immediately cease discharging any wastes to the sanitary sewer system of the
city or to facilities that discharge directly or indirectly into its
system.  Should a suspended permittee fail to voluntarily comply with any
suspension order, the Superintendent shall take such actions as are deemed
necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize damage to the WWTP and/or to
protect the health and welfare of the general public.



      (6)   A suspended permit may be reinstated by the
Superintendent upon submission of assurances satisfactory to the
Superintendent that the suspended permittee will comply with this section and
the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant this section plus payment of
such fines or other penalties as may be levied by the WWTP. The
Superintendent shall require that within fifteen (15) days after the date of

§ 52.51  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.



   (A)   Compliance date report.  Within ninety (90) days following
the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in
the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Mayor a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements.  The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O and M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.  This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified
by a qualified professional.



   (B)   Periodic compliance reports.  Any user subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard or, in the case of new sources, after commencement of the discharge
into the POTW, shall submit to the Mayor during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the Mayor, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in
the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards.  In addition,
this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the
reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported in  §
52.50(B)(2)(e).  Significant industrial users must report all
self-monitoring conducted during the reporting period.  Categorical users
subject to production-based standards shall report annual production rates. 
At the discretion of flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the
Mayor may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be
submitted.  This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user.



      (1)   The Mayor may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or
in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate.  In
such cases, the report required above shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.  These
reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge,
including the flow, nature, and concentration, or production and mass where
requested by the Mayor, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by
the applicable pretreatment standards.  The frequency of monitoring shall be
prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standards.  All analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator
pursuant to § 304(g) of the Clean Water Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part
136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
Administrator.  Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the Administrator.



      (2)   Note:  Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a
sampling of analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the EPA publication "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of
Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants", April, 1977, and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
Administrator.



   (C)   Monitoring facilities.  The city shall require to be provided
and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems.  The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Significant industrial
users must report a change in their monitoring point prior to making the
change. 



      (1)   There will be ample room in or near such sampling
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis.  The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the
expense of the user.



      (2)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.  Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following written notification by the city.



      (3)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the city immediately.  the user shall
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results to the city within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.  Exception to this
regulation is only if the city performs sampling within the same time period
for the same pollutant in question.



   (D)   Inspection and sampling.  The city shall inspect the
facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is
being met and all requirements are being complied with.  Person or occupants
of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or
its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, or in
the performance of any of their duties.  The city shall have the right to
copy any records maintained by any user hereunder. The EPA shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering
operations.  Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the
user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that
upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
approval authority, and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities.



   (E)   Pretreatment.  Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve
compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations.  Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.  Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility.  The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
city under the provisions of this chapter.  Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
Dilution is prohibited as a means of treating wastes to meet federal and
local limits.



      (1)   The city shall annually publish in the Madisonville
Messenger a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with
any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the previous
twelve (12) months.  The notification shall also summarize any enforcement
actions taken against such users during the same twelve (12) months.



      (2)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval
authority upon request, and they shall be kept on file for a period of at
least three (3) years. This period of retention shall be extended during the
course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or POTW or
when requested by officials of EPA or approval authority.



   (F)   Confidential information.  Information and data on an
industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications,
permits, and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to
the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
of the user.



   (G)   Bypass. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which
does not cause  pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential  maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (G) (1) and (2)
of this section.



      (1)   Notice.



         (a)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need
for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if
possible for at  least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass.



         (b)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the
Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial
user becomes  aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided  within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware
of the  bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the 
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact  dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the  anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or  planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent reoccurrence of the  bypass. The Control Authority may waive the
written report on a  case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty-four (24) hours.



      (2)   Prohibition of bypass.



         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority
may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:



            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage;



            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the  use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated  wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment
should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment
to prevent a bypass which  occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or  preventable maintenance; and



            3.   The industrial user submitted notices as
required under division (G)(1) of this section.



         (b)   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated
bypass, after  considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division
(G)(2)(a) of this section.

(Ord. passed 9-2-86)



§ 52.54  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.



   (A)   Notification of violation.  Whenever the Mayor finds that any
user has violated or is violating this chapter, or a wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, the Mayor or his agent may serve upon the user
written notice of the violation.  Within ten (10) days of the receipt date
of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted to the Mayor. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation.



   (B)   Consent orders.  The Mayor is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the
noncompliance.  Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the
order.  Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders issued pursuant to division (D) below.



   (C)   Show cause hearing.  The Mayor may order any user which
causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken.  Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.  The notice may be
served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. 
Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement
action may be pursued.



   (D)   Compliance order.  When the Mayor finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued
hereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated.  Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.



   (E)   Cease and desist orders.  When the Mayor finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the Mayor may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:



      (1)   Comply forthwith.



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the discharge.



   (F)   Administrative fines.  Notwithstanding any other section of
this chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this
chapter, or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount
of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation.  Each day on
which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation.  Such assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the Mayor shall have such other collection
remedies as he has to collect other service charges.  Unpaid charges, fines,
and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's
property.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the
mayor to reconsider the fine within ten (10) days of being notified of the
fine.  When the Mayor believes a request has merit, he shall convene a
hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request from
the user.



   (G)   Termination of permit.



      (1)   Users proposing to discharge into the POTW must first
obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the control authority.  Any user
who violates the following conditions of this chapter or a wastewater
discharge permit or order, or any applicable or state and federal law, is
subject to termination of permits and/or sewer service:



         (a)   Violation of permit conditions.



         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge.



         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics.



         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's
premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.



      (2)   Noncompliant users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show
cause under division (C) above why the proposed action should not be taken.



(Ord. passed 8-19-91)



§ 52.55  JUDICIAL REMEDIES.



   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes
into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this
chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the Mayor, through the City
Attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable
relief in the Circuit Court of Hopkins County, Kentucky.



   (A)   Injunctive relief.  Whenever a user has violated or continues
to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder, the Mayor, through counsel, may petition the court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
user.  The Mayor shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to
collect other sewer service charges.



   (B)   Civil penalties.  Any user who has violated or continues to
violate this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable
to the Mayor for a civil penalty of not more than twenty five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) but at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus
actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the
violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages,
the Mayor may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses.  The Mayor shall petition the court to impose, assess,
and recover such sums.  In determining amount of liability, the court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of hard caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.

enforcement option he deems necessary as an initial response. The offender
shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all
violations.



   (D)   Any user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan
or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
chapter, or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or  knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be punished by a fine of at
least five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation or imprisonment for not
more than one year or both.  Each day shall be considered a separate
violation.

§ 53.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs). Schedules of activities, prohibitions
of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and
educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices
to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to
stormwater, receiving waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also
include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control
site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from
raw materials storage.



   BMP PLAN (STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN or SWPPP). A document
which describes the best management practices and activities to be
implemented by a person or business to identify sources of pollution or
contamination at a site and the actions to eliminate or reduce pollutant
discharges to stormwater, stormwater conveyance systems, and/or receiving
waters to the maximum extent practicable.



   CLEAN WATER ACT. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
§§ 1251 et seq.), and any subsequent amendments thereto and regulations
promulgated thereunder.



   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT.



      (1)   A construction activity is part of a larger COMMON PLAN
OF DEVELOPMENT if it is completed in one (1) or more of the following ways:
in separate stages; in separate phases; in combination with other
construction activities. It is identified by the documentation that
identifies the scope of the project including such things as the following:
plats; blueprints; marketing plans; contracts; building permits; public
notice or hearing; zoning requests. It can include one operator or many
operators.

three-fourths (3/4) of an acre, another company is clearing four (4)
different acres, and a contractor is excavating another one-half (1/2) 
acre. In this case, the total area that would be disturbed is five and
one-fourth (5-1/4) acres, so each operator would fall under the requirements
associated with disturbing one (1) or more acres.



   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. Activities subject to NPDES construction
permits. These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of
one (1) acre or more or part of a common plan of development. Such activities
include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating,
and demolition.



   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Any material, including any substance, waste, or
combination thereof, which because of its quantity, concentration, or
physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may cause, or significantly

safety, property, or the environment when improperly treated, stored,
transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed.



   ILLEGAL DISCHARGE. Any direct or indirect non-stormwater discharge to
the storm drain system, except as exempted in § 53.06.



   ILLICIT CONNECTIONS. Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or
subsurface, which allows an illegal discharge to enter the storm drain system
including but not limited to any conveyances which allow any non-stormwater
discharge including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to enter the
storm drain system and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor
drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection had been
previously allowed, permitted, or approved by the city.



   INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. Activities subject to NPDES industrial permits as
defined in 40 CFR, § 122.26 (b)(14).



   NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) STORMWATER
DISCHARGE PERMIT. A permit issued by the EPA (or by a state under authority
delegated pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b)) that authorizes the discharge of
pollutants to waters of the United States, whether the permit is applicable
on an individual, group, or general area-wide basis.



   NON-STORMWATER DISCHARGE. Any discharge to the storm drain system that
is not composed entirely of stormwater.



   POLLUTANT. Anything which causes or contributes to pollution.
POLLUTANTS may include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes, and
solvents; oil and other automotive fluids; non-hazardous liquid and solid
wastes and yard wastes; refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded
or abandoned objects, ordnances, and accumulations, so that same may cause or
contribute to pollution; pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers; hazardous
substances and wastes; sewage, fecal coil form and pathogens; dissolved and
particulate metals; animal wastes; wastes and residues that result from
constructing a building or structure; and noxious or offensive matter of any
kind.



   STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM. Publicly-owned facilities by which stormwater is
collected and/or conveyed, including but not limited to any roads with
drainage systems, municipal streets, gutters, curbs, inlets, piped storm
drains, pumping facilities, retention and detention basins, natural and
human-made or altered drainage channels, reservoirs, and other drainage
structures.



   WASTEWATER. Any water or other liquid, other than uncontaminated
stormwater, discharged from a facility.

necessary to protect public health and safety.



      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a
verbal notification to the Engineering Department prior to the time of the
test.



      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater
discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.



   (C)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue.



(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-16-07)



§ 53.07  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.



   (A)   Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations.
The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters
of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.



   (B)   Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any
person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and
hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of
the city.



(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-16-07)



§ 53.08  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.



   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with the permit is required prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.



(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-16-07)



§ 53.09  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that
have stormwater discharges associated with industrial or construction
activity.



   (B)   Access to Facilities.



      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the city.



      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.



      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.



      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written request of the city and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.



      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of
this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit
to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.



      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.



(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-16-07)



§ 53.10  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS
BY USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The city will identify best management practices for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at that person’s expense, additional structural and
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be
part of a BMP plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.



(Ord. 2007-16, passed 7-16-07)



§ 53.11  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.



   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,

from a 0.61 inch rainfall event.



   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES or BMPS. Schedules of activities,
prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management
practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.

(Ord. O-2019-20, passed 12-16-19)



§ 54.04  STORMWATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND STRUCTURES DESIGN CRITERIA.



   The following criteria shall control when designing stormwater
conveyance facilities and water quality control structures:



   (A)   Open channels and roadside ditches. The design storm for the
design of open channels and roadside ditches shall be a storm with a
recurrence frequency of ten (10) years. The time of concentration for open
channel and roadside ditches shall be calculated with a minimum of ten (10)
minutes. In all cases, the 100-year discharge elevation must be checked to
ensure that adjacent structures do not suffer flood damage.



   (B)   Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of
storm sewers and inlets shall be the 10-year storm. Storm sewers and inlets
shall be checked under 25-year storm loading conditions for ponding limits
and ensure the system does not surcharge out of any inlets creating potential
structure hazards. The ponding limit for streets with curb and gutter shall
be an 8-foot spread measured from gutter to driving lane. Spread calculations
shall be based on the design for the ten (10) year storm with a minimum
intensity of four (4) inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the
actual time of concentration. The minimum time of concentration used should
be no less than ten (10) minutes.



   (C)   Driveway entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for
the design of driveway entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 10-year
storm. The duration of the design storm shall be assumed to be equal to the
calculated time of concentration. The minimum time of concentration shall be
assumed to be ten (10) minutes. Entrance pipes and cross drains shall be
checked under 25-year storm conditions to ensure against overtopping of
roadways and flood damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes
larger than thirty-six (36) inches shall be designed using the culvert
criteria in division (D) below. Minimum pipe size shall be twelve (12) inches
except that driveway entrance pipe may be 10 inches with prior approval by
the City Engineer.



   (D)   Culverts. The design storm for the calculation of runoff for
culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The duration of the design storm
shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. The
recommended check storm is the 100-year storm. The maximum headwater under
100-year storm conditions should not be allowed to overtop roads or increase
the flooding potential in the affected areas. Headwater for the 10-year
discharge should not exceed 1.2 times the structure rise. Downstream channel
must receive appropriate protection or energy dissipation if the design
outlet discharge would cause erosive conditions. Traffic safety must be
considered in the design of culvert end treatments. This may include
extending the culvert beyond the right-of-way limits, installing catch basins
to intercept roadside swales, and installing guardrails. Designs must conform
to meet the requirements of the agency responsible for road maintenance and
safety. Follow method as described in the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet
Drainage Guidance Manual.



   (E)   Erosion control. Plans for stormwater conveyance systems shall
include the applicable provisions identified under Chapter 160, Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control.



   (F)   Design certification. Design of all stormwater conveyance,
management and quality facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed
professional engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall
be in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways' Manual of
Instructions for Drainage Design, latest edition and City of Madisonville
Standards Guidance for Development.



(Ord. O-2019-20, passed 12-16-19)



§ 54.05  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES DESIGN CRITERIA.



   As a minimum, the following criteria shall be followed when designing
stormwater management facilities and control structures:



   (A)   Design storm.



      (1)   Water quantity controls shall be implemented so that
post-development peak discharges for three (3) design storms are no more than
the pre-development peak discharge. The 1-year, 2- year, 10-year, 25-year,
and 100-year 24-hour duration storm events must be analyzed for any proposed
construction and no increase in discharge rate from the pre-developed site
must take place. Additionally, the 100-year event must be analyzed to ensure
no adverse impacts on other properties occur. In the event a development is
upstream of a structure located in a special flood hazard area as defined by
FEMA FIRM Maps adopted by the city, the post development run off rates shall
be reduced from the pre-development run off rate by 10%.



      (2)   For those areas of development and re-development that
result in a new or expanded discharge from the MS4 to high-quality waters,
the Design Engineer must perform a critical storm analysis by considering
multiple durations (1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour) for
different return intervals (1-year, 2-year, 10-year, 25-year and 100-year),
to establish the worst case scenario for the given circumstance under
consideration. Engineering judgement may be used in some cases to make
determinations and will be coordinated with the City Engineer.



   (B)   Emergency spillways. The emergency spillway shall be sized to
accommodate a flow equal to the design overflow of the 100-year storm
post-development discharge, assuming all other outlets are



completely blocked, without overtopping the dam. Discharge must be conveyed
to a public outlet of sufficient capacity. Erosion protection must be
provided for the spillway and receiving stream and energy



dissipation must be employed.



   (C)   Design calculations. Design calculations submitted must
include, but are not limited to, the



following:



      (1)   Contributing drainage area, in acres show
pre-development and post-development watershed areas and how they differ.



      (2)   A breakdown of surface type for pre-development and
post-development conditions (such as grassed, paved, roofed, and the like) as
the weighted curve numbers are calculated.



      (3)   Stage-storage curve for the proposed stormwater
management facility.



      (4)   Stage-discharge curve for the outlet structure of the
proposed stormwater management facility.



      (5)   Inflow and outflow hydrographs for pre-development and
post-development conditions.



      (6)   Emergency spillway design calculations.



      (7)   Embankment design criteria as it relates to slope
stability and compaction requirements during construction.



   (D)   Gradient. All detention basins having a vegetative cover shall
be designed, constructed, and



maintained equal to or greater than 1% throughout to the point of discharge.



   (E)   Stormwater management plan. The final stormwater management
plan for the entire development shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:



      (1)   All calculations, assumptions and criteria used in the
design of the stormwater management facilities and control structures.



      (2)   All plans and profiles of proposed storm sewers and open
channels including horizontal and vertical controls, elevations, sizes,
slopes and materials.



      (3)   Location, dimensions and design details required for the
construction of all facilities.



      (4)   A description of the operation and maintenance needs for
the stormwater management facilities.



      (5)   All information relative to the design and operation of

(Ord. O-2019-20, passed 12-16-19)



§ 54.06  STORMWATER QUALITY CONTROL STRUCTURES DESIGN CRITERIA.



   The following criteria shall control when designing stormwater quality
control structures:



   (A)   Water quality control structures. In addition to carrying
pollutants, stormwater runoff from developed areas increases the frequency
and duration of full-bank flows in the receiving streams, causing increased
erosion of the stream banks and further degradation of in-stream water
quality, on-site infiltration, designed for the increased runoff due to
development, is the preferred solution to this impact. A water quality
control facility must capture and treat the 80th percentile rainfall event
"first flush", or the runoff volume corresponding with a 0.61 - inch rainfall
event. The water quality volume for sizing green infrastructure BMPs shall be
computed as follows:



               Rv = 0.009(1) + 0.05



   Where:



      Rv =      volumentric runoff coefficient; and



      I =      the percent imperviousness of the drainage area.



 



               WQV = 3,630 x Rv x P x A



   Where:



      3,630 =   conversion factor from acre - inches to cubic feet;



      WQV =   water quality volume (ft3);



      Rv =      volumetric runoff coefficient;



      P =      rainfall depth associated with the 80th percentile
precipitation event (in.), equivalent to a rainfall event of 0.61 inches; and



      A =      drainage area to BMP (acres).



   (B)   Stormwater quality plan. The final stormwater quality plan for
the entire development shall include, but not be limited to, the following:



      (1)   All calculations, assumptions and criteria used in the
design of the stormwater quality control structures.



      (2)   Location, dimensions and design details required for the
construction of all facilities.



      (3)   A description of the operation and maintenance needs for
the stormwater quality control structures.



      (4)   All deed restrictions, easements and rights-of-way.



      (5)   The ownership and maintenance responsibilities for all
stormwater quality control structures during and after development. The
identity of the responsible individual, corporation, association or other
specific entity and the specific maintenance activities and schedule must be
outlined on the plan.



      (6)   Stormwater quality management facilities shall be
designed to effectively treat the required amount of water quality runoff
volume for the developed site.



      (7)   Project narrative and summary from existing conditions
to proposed conditions showing that applicable ordinances are met.



   (C)   Design certification. Design of all stormwater quality
facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed professional engineer
(Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall be in accordance with
the Kentucky Department of Highways' Manual of Instructions for Drainage
Design, latest edition and City of Madisonville Standards Guidance for
Development.



   (D)   Construction certification. Prior to final approval of the
development, the licensed professional engineer must submit certification
that the stormwater quality control structures were constructed in accordance
with the approved plan. Final approval shall also provide evidence of the
recording of all stormwater conveyance, management, and water quality
facilities deed restrictions, easements and rights-of-way. Any request for
deviation from the approved plan during construction shall be submitted to
the City Engineer in writing for approval.



   (E)   Ownership, operation and maintenance of stormwater control and
water quality management facilities. For all developments requiring
stormwater control and water quality management facilities, ownership and
maintenance responsibilities remain with the property owner/developer. The
Stormwater Management/BMP Facilities Long-term Maintenance Agreement must be
signed, notarized, and submitted with the stormwater quality management plan.



   (F)   Additional treatment and monitoring may be required. The city
reserves the right to require for new and redeveloped properties superseding
or additional treatment criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as
necessary to meet overall stormwater quality management program objectives or
directives under a watershed improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)
program or KPDES/NPDES permit program as administered by the USEPA or
Commonwealth of Kentucky.



   (G)   Self inspection required. The property owner shall provide
annual self-inspection documentation for water quality management facilities
as outlined in the Stormwater Management/BMP Facilities Agreement. The City
Engineer or his/her designee will periodically inspect water quality
management facilities for the purpose of identifying maintenance and
structural deficiencies and if required proof of monitoring. If additional
treatment and or monitoring is required, the property owner shall be fully
responsible for monitoring their stormwater management and water quality
facilities in accordance with the most recent directives under a watershed
improvement or Total Maximum Daily Load Program or KPDES/NPDES permit program
as administered by the USEPA or Commonwealth of Kentucky. In the event a
deficiency is discovered a notice of violation will be issued and shall be
enforced under this code.



   (H)   In lieu of fee or off site mitigation program may be
established. The City of Madisonville Engineering Department may develop a
payment-in-lieu program to allow property owners/developers to make payment
to the city in lieu of constructing stormwater quality management structures.
The in lieu of fee funds shall be applied to public stormwater projects.
Another option is to allow the property owner/developer to provide off site
mitigation in the same watershed. Both of these options may be developed by
the City of Madisonville Engineering Department following the permit
requirements of the KPDES Permit For Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
Systems.

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES



§ 70.15  SIGNAL LEGENDS.



   Whenever traffic is regulated or controlled exclusively by a
traffic-control sign or signs exhibiting the words, "Go," "Caution," or
"Stop," or exhibiting different colored lights for purposes of traffic
control, the following colors only shall be used, and these terms and lights
shall indicate and be obeyed as follows:



   (A)   Green alone or "Go":  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn.  However, vehicular traffic shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.



   (B)   Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the
green or "Go" signal: Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is
thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a
red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular
traffic shall not enter the intersection.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady
yellow signal may enter and clear the intersection.



   (C)   Red alone or double red or "Stop":  Vehicular traffic facing
the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible
line, and shall remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.



   (D)   Flashing red alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at
such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not
again proceed until it can do so without danger.



   (E)   Flashing yellow alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection
controlled by such signal.



   (F)   "Yield Right-of-Way":  Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering
the primary intersecting or merging right-of-way. All traffic facing the sign
shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such
primary intersecting or merging right-of-way.  No vehicle facing a "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a
speed in excess of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not
apply to vehicles entering an expressway.



   (G)   Lane lights:  When lane lights are installed over any street
for the purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular
traffic shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. 
However, when flashing yellow lights appear above a lane all left turns shall
be made from that lane.  Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles
shall not move against them.  If flashing yellow lights show above a lane,
that lane shall be used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at
such place prohibits such turn.



Penalty, see § 70.99

traffic device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to
direct the movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or
interferes with the effectiveness of any official control device or any
railroad sign or signal.  No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any
commercial advertising.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as
restricting any public department or public utility of the city in any
emergency or temporarily from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign
whose placing has been approved by the Chief of Police.



   (B)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to

time longer than specified on official signs any day between the hours of

vehicle becoming physically attached to a wrecker or tow truck.



      (2)   After a vehicle has been physically attached to a
wrecker, but before the wrecker has left the scene, the owner or operator of
the vehicle may take possession of the vehicle only on payment to the wrecker
driver of a fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) in return for which the
wrecker driver shall issued a release to the owner or operator.  Such
release shall be in the form of a receipt furnished by the Police Department

dollars ($35.00).  Each driver of a city wrecker and driver or owner of each

such release issued during the preceding twenty-four (24)-hour period and
shall remit with the report all fees collected during the period.



   (B)   Neither the removal of a vehicle by an owner or operator as
referred to in division (A)(1) nor the issuance of the release referred to in

such vehicle from responsibility for any violation of the traffic code with
which he may be charged.



§ 72.23  TOWING AND CUSTODIAN CARE CHARGES.



   (A)   A towing charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for each hour or
fraction of an hour required for towing shall be made by the Police
Department for each motor vehicle.  This charge shall be paid by the owner
of the vehicle before it is released.  Where it is necessary to use more
than one wrecker or other additional equipment in moving or recovering a
vehicle, an additional charge of eighteen dollars ($18.00) per hour or
fraction of an hour shall be assessed for each additional wrecker or
additional equipment used. However, if the additional wrecker or equipment is
furnished by contract wrecker or other private person the charge made shall
be the actual cost of the equipment to the city but not less than twenty
dollars ($20.00) per hour or fraction thereof.



   (B)   The city tow lots shall charge an amount agreed to by the
legislative body for storage and handling.  It shall be the duty of the

supplementary emergency wrecker services and these services shall be
performed on a twenty-four (24)-hour basis in lieu of the regular city
wreckers.  The wrecker's qualifications shall be determined by the Chief of
Police.  The wreckers shall be equipped to perform the services with
efficiency to conform with the charges set forth by §§ 72.22(A) (2) and
72.23(A) and (B).  The contractor is to protect the city by furnishing
insurance fully covered as to public liability, property damage, cargo,
workman's compensation, and any other insurance necessary in the performance
of its duties.



§ 72.25  REPORTS BY CUSTODIAN OF CITY TOW LOTS.



   The custodian of the city tow lots shall be required to render an
immediate report to the Police Department as to the condition of each motor
vehicle placed in his custody.  This report shall be made on a form to be
furnished by the Department which report shall be signed by the driver of the
wrecker delivering the vehicle and by an employee of the custodian receiving
the vehicle.



§ 72.26  SALE OF VEHICLE.



   Any motor vehicle remaining in the possession of the custodian of the
city tow lots to whom it has been delivered and with whom it has remained for
a period of 45 days without being reclaimed by the rightful owner thereof,
and without the payment of the towing and storage charges thereon, may after
authorization from the Chief of Police, be sold to pay such towing and
storage. The advertisement of the proposed sale shall be published once a
week for three weeks in a newspaper of general circulation as set forth in
KRS 424.130.  The last such advertisement shall be made at least seven days
before sale is held.  Notice of sale shall be sent by registered mail to the
owner of the motor vehicle and to any other person known to have any interest
therein, addressed to such person at their last known address at least ten
days before the sale is held.  The owner of the motor vehicle may sign
waiver of notice of sale and waiting period and permit the custodian of city
tow lots to sell the motor vehicle whenever he deems proper and necessary.
Should the proceeds of the sale of any vehicle pursuant to this section be
insufficient to satisfy accrued charges for towing, transporting, and/or
storage, said sale and collection of proceeds shall not constitute a waiver
or release of responsibility for payment of unpaid towing, transporting,
and/or storage charges by the owner or responsible casualty insurer of the
vehicle.  This lien shall be subject to prior recorded liens.

space for their resident bees to reduce the likelihood of swarming. Hives
shall be requeened no less than once every two (2) years to help prevent
swarming.



   (D)   To minimize contact with humans and domesticated animals and
accidental intrusion by children, hives shall be surrounded by a structure at

vegetation or combination thereof so that all bees are forced to fly at an
elevation of at least six (6) feet above ground, level in the vicinity of the
apiary.

not congregate at swimming pools, bibcocks, pet watering bowls, bird baths or
other water sources where they may cause human, bird or domesticated animal
contact on public or private property.



   (F)   Hive maintenance materials shall be stored in a sealed

lot. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, an additional two (2) nucleus
colonies of half size that are constructed to help prevent swarming may be
maintained.



   (I)   No hive shall be located within seventy-five (75) feet of an
adjoining property owner without the written consent of the adjoining
property owner.



   (J)   Bees or hives shall be considered a public nuisance when
colonies exhibit defensive or objectionable behavior; interfere with the

service or certified mail a notice of violation specifying the nature of the
violation, the action to be taken in order to comply with this section, and
the time in which to comply with this section not to exceed thirty (30) days
from the date of the notice. In the event the beekeeper fails to bring the
colony or hive into compliance with this section within the period specified
by the Code Enforcement Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or his or her
designee may enter upon the property and cause the bees to be destroyed or
relocated outside of the city at the expense of the beekeeper. Any person
aggrieved by any action or decision of the Code Enforcement Officer shall
have ten (10) days from the receipt of the Code Enforcement Officer decision
or directive to file a written notice of appeal with the Madisonville City
Clerk. Any appeal shall be heard by a committee of three (3) members of the
City Council appointed by the Mayor for the purpose of the hearing.

subchapter and to secure and hold the city and its officers harmless against
any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and
other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the City
Council, or any city officer or agent may be made liable by reason of any
accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee,
either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury
resulting from the negligence of the permittee. The bond shall further be
conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with all regulations to fill up,
restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its
original condition, and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all
openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where
excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after
said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in

   (A)   The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that
during the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions as nearly
normal as practicable shall be maintained at all times so as to cause as
little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the abutting property
and to the general public; however, the City Engineer may permit the closing
of streets to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him if in his
opinion it is necessary.  The permittee shall route and control traffic,
including his own vehicles, as directed by the Police Department.

detours.  The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways
designated as detours without expense to the permittee but in case there are
not existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at his
expense and in conformity with the specifications of the City Engineer.  The
permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any
highways or streets by the operation of its equipment.

by the permittee.  The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be
similarly borne by the permittee unless he makes other arrangements with the
person owning the utility.



   (B)   The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or
otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be

to protect and carry out said work.



   (C)   Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench
through any lawn area, the area shall be seeded and mulched. All construction
and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn
area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to
that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove,
even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or

streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those
using streets and adjoining property.



   (B)   Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow
to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench (such as might
be the case in a narrow alley) the City Engineer shall have the authority to
require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and
then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of the backfilling. It shall be
the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make
all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.

   All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the
excavation work shall be repaired by the permittee. Materials for such repair
shall conform with the requirements of any applicable city regulation. If,
upon being ordered, the permittee fails to furnish the necessary labor and
materials for such repairs, the City Engineer shall have the authority to
cause said necessary labor and materials to be furnished by the city and the
cost shall be charged against the permittee. The permittee shall also be
liable on his bond therefor. Materials shall mean No. 610 or dense graded
aggregate stone and may be placed in the trench temporarily until blacktop or
concrete is available.

   (B)   From time to time as may be ordered by the City Engineer and
in any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall
at his own expense clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any
kind resulting from said work. Upon failure to do so within 24 hours after
having been notified to do so by the City Engineer, said work may be done by
the City Engineer and the cost thereof charged to the permittee. The
permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond
provided hereunder.



(Ord. passed 2-17-86) Penalty, see § 91.99



§ 91.62  PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.



   The permittee shall provide for the flow of all watercourses, sewers,
or drains intercepted during the excavation work and shall replace the same
in as good condition as he found them or shall make such provision for them
as the City Engineer may direct. The permittee shall not obstruct the gutter
of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free
passage of surface water. The permittee shall make provision to take care of
all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings, or other run-off pumped from
excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be
responsible for any damage resulting from his failure to so provide.

excavation purposes and where trenches are to be four (4) feet or over in
depth, the pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six (6) inches
beyond the outer limits of the sub-grade that is to be disturbed in order to
prevent settlement, and a six (6) inch shoulder of undisturbed material shall
be provided in each side of the excavated trench. The face of the remaining
pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power-driven concrete saw shall
be used so as to permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base
without ragged edges. Asphalt paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a
straight line. No pile driver may be used in breaking up the pavement.

§ 91.65  BACKFILLING.



   (A)   Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an
excavation permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree equivalent
to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting
shall be done by mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers. When
water is taken from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign one person to
operate the hydrant and shall make certain that said person has been
instructed by the city's Water Department in the operation of the hydrant.
The Water Department shall likewise be notified at both the beginning and end
of the job so that the condition of the fire hydrants can be checked on both
occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant during the excavation shall be the
responsibility of the permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on
the terms agreed upon with the Water Department.



   (B)   Backfilling up to the first eighteen (18) inches above the top
of the utility pipes or similar installations shall be done with thin layers.
Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that are
hand tamped shall not exceed six (6) inches in thickness. Layers that are
power tamped shall not exceed six (6) inches in thickness. The same
requirements shall apply to the remainder of the backfilling if tamping is
the method used for backfilling.  Backfilling of all pipes over twenty-four
(24) inches in diameter shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in
three-inch layers, with each layer moistened and thoroughly tamped with
suitable mechanical equipment. The backfill around all pipes twenty-four (24)
inches or less in diameter, shall be tamped as specified above to a depth of
eighteen (18) inches above the top of the pipe before any additional
backfilling is placed thereon.



   (C)   Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through
rock, the pipe shall be laid six (6) inches above the rock bottom of the
trench and the space under, around, and six (6) inches above the pipe shall
be backfilled with clean river sand, non-corrosive soil, or one quarter (1/4)
inch minus gravel. Broken pavement, large stones, and debris shall not be
used in the backfill.



   (D)   Backfilling shall be completed by placing the backfill
material well up over the top of the trench. For dry backfilling, the
material shall be compacted with a roller of an approved type or with the
rear of a truck carrying at least five (5) tons until the surface is
unyielding. The surface shall then be graded as required.



(Ord. passed 2-17-86) Penalty, see § 91.99



§ 91.66  RESTORATION OF SURFACE.



   (A)   The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets broken
into or damaged as a result of the excavation work, to its original condition
in accordance with the specifications of the City Engineer. The permittee may
be required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic
lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the
cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made
with suitable material well tamped into place and this fill shall be topped

cancellation or revocation of an assessment or reassessment moratorium, the
property shall be assessed on the basis of its full fair cash value.



   (J)   The applicant shall notify the administering agency when the
project is complete and the administering agency shall then conduct an
on-site inspection of the property for purposes of verifying improvements. 
Only after the project is complete and the improvements verified shall the
moratorium certificate be issued by the administering agency.



   (K)   An assessment or reassessment moratorium certificate may be
transferred or assigned by the holder of the certificate to a new owner or
lessee of the property provided that such certificate has not expired.



   (L)   Any property granted an assessment or reassessment moratorium
may be eligible for subsequent moratorium certification provided that
reapplication be made no sooner than three (3) years following that
expiration of the original moratorium.

(Ord. 94-21, passed 9-19-94)



ENFORCEMENT



§ 101.10  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory
housing practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may field a complaint with the Mayor.  Complaints shall be in
writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Mayor
requires.  Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy
of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to
commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days
after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of any period of reference under subsection (C), the Mayor shall investigate
the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he
intends to resolve it.  If the Mayor decides to resolve the complaints, he
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory
housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and
persuasion.  Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors
may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this
chapter without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of
the Mayor who shall make public any information in violation of this
provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof
shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned
not more than one (1) year.



   (B)   A complaint under subsection (A) shall be filed within one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing
practice occurred.  Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts
upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. 
Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.  A respondent
may file an answer to the complaint against him and with the leave of the
Mayor, which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do
so, may amend his answer at any time.  Both complaints and answers shall be
verified.



   (C)   If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the
Mayor, the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this
chapter, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a
complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.  The Mayor will assist in this filing.



   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance
within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within
thirty (30) days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court,
against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted
or protected by this chapter, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of
the complaint.  If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice
has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from
engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be
appropriate.



   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden
of proof shall be on the complainant.



   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial,
the Mayor shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary
compliance.



(Ord. 94-21, passed 9-19-94)



§ 101.11  INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS, GIVING OF EVIDENCE.



   (A)   In conducting an investigation the Mayor shall have access at
all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy
such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such person
as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation,
provided however, that the Mayor first complies with the provisions of the
Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution relating to unreasonable
searches and seizures.  The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his access
to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons,
and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject
to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories
were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States district
court for the district in which the investigation is taking place.  The
Mayor may administer oaths.



   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the
name of the Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the Mayor himself.  Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show on their fact the name and address of such respondent
and shall state that they were issued at his request.



   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled
to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in
United States district courts.  Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.



   (D)   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any
person, such person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the
subpoena.  The Mayor shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena
required appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it
requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under
investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for
other good reason.



   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor
or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its
enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the
person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts
business.



   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and
testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or
other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or
lawful order of the Mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or
statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted
to the Mayor pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully
neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries
in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully
mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence,
shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned
not more than one year, or both.



   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the
Mayor participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.



(Ord. 94-21, passed 9-19-94)



§ 101.12  ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS.



   (A)   The rights granted by §§ 101.02, 101.03, 101.04 - 101.05 may
be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction.  A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred,
provided however that the court shall continue such civil case brought
pursuant to this section or § 101.10(D) from time to time before bringing it
to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the Mayor are
likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing
practice complained of in the complaint made to the Mayor and which practice
forms the basis for the action in court, and, provided however, that any sale
encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order
issued under the authority of this chapter, and involving a bonafide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provision of this chapter
shall not be affected.



   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any
permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) punitive damages, together with court costs and
reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff, provided that
the said plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to
assume said attorney's fees.

action.

discourage such citizen or any other citizen from lawfully aiding or
encouraging other persons to participate, without discrimination on account
of race, color, religion, disability, or national origin, in any of the
activities, services, organizations or facilities described in subsection

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 102.01  FINDINGS.



   (A)   It is anticipated that an increasing number of requests will
be made for access to and use of public rights-of-way for the provision of
utility services.



   (B)   The city has the legal authority to regulate the use of its
streets, public rights-of-way and other municipal property and to grant
access thereto upon certain terms and conditions.



   (C)   Public rights-of-way within the city:



      (1)   Are critical to the travel of persons and the transport
of goods and other tangibles in the business and social life of the community
by all persons and are used by the city to provide critical services to its
citizens, including water and other public utilities, electric and
communications services and services to protect public safety;



      (2)   Can be partially occupied by entities the facilities of
which are used in the delivery, conveyance and transmission of utility
services to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic
well-being of the city and its residents;



      (3)   Are a unique and physically-limited resource so that
proper management by the city is necessary to maximize the efficiency and to
minimize the costs to the public of the foregoing uses, to protect against
foreclosure of future economic expansion because of premature exhaustion of
public rights-of-way as an economic resource and to minimize the
inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities'
construction, emplacement, relocation and maintenance in the public
rights-of-way; and



      (4)   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and
controlled consistent with that intent.



   (D)   The right to place privately-owned facilities and fixtures in
such public rights-of-way for business purposes is a valuable economic right
to use a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at
great expense to the city and its taxpayers.



(Ord. 2003-08, passed 3-17-03)



§ 102.02  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The city is the owner of the public rights-of-way (“ROW”)
and has control and authority over access to such public rights-of-way within
the jurisdictional boundaries of the city.



   (B)   The city has the right under local, state and federal law:



      (1)   To regulate the location and manner of construction
within and to manage the safe, orderly and efficient use of the city's public
rights-of-way;



      (2)   To facilitate timely installation of utility
infrastructure in an environmentally sound manner; and



      (3)   To minimize the disruption of public property otherwise
associated with construction within public rights-of-way.



   (C)   It is the policy of the city that the use and development of
its public rights-of-way be undertaken and managed such that all city
residents and businesses are provided reliable and high quality utility
services at the lowest reasonable cost.



   (D)   Substantial public funds have been invested to build, maintain
and repair the public rights-of-way and the city holds such public
rights-of-way as assets in trust for its citizens. Regulation of construction
in public rights-of-way:



      (1)   Helps reduce disruption of and interference with their
use;



      (2)   Helps to prevent pavement damage and maintains the safe
condition of the streets; and



      (3)   Protects the public health, safety and welfare.  Such
regulation is therefore a valid and appropriate exercise of the city's police
power and is a municipal affair.



   (E)   The city intends through this chapter to establish a uniform
policy for usage of its ROW that will:



      (1)   Permit fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to
the ROW;



      (2)   Provide fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
compensation for the management and use of the ROW;



      (3)   Comply with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, standards and policies, including the
National Electrical Code and the National Electrical Safety Code and any city
transmission and distribution standards;



      (4)   Support cost-effective, optimal use of public resources
and economic development; and



      (5)   Minimize the congestion, inconvenience, cost, visual
impacts and other adverse effects on the ROW, including environmental impacts
which could result from the construction, operation and maintenance of
redundant infrastructure.



(Ord. 2003-08, passed 3-17-03)



§ 102.03  SCOPE; UTILITY SYSTEMS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER IS APPLICABLE.



   (A)   This chapter applies to utility systems that are or proposed
to be located within public rights-of-way, regardless of whether these
utility systems are in operation as of the effective date of this chapter or
do not become operational until after the effective date of this chapter.
However, this chapter shall not apply to any electric utility system which
has a franchise agreement with the city.



   (B)    Incumbent providers must comply with the requirements of this
chapter within sixty (60) days of the effective date. However, the Mayor may,
in his/her sole discretion and where good cause is shown, extend for an
additional thirty (30) days the time accorded an incumbent provider for
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.



   (C)   This chapter does not accord to any utility a right to attach
a utility system to municipally-owned poles and structures. The terms and
conditions of any such attachments, if permitted, would be governed by
individual pole attachment agreements that must be negotiated separately. No
attachments to municipally-owned facilities can be made absent the execution
of an agreement with the city.

   (B)   To the extent reasonable and appropriate, the terms of any
franchise issued or franchise agreement entered into by the city shall be
consistent with the terms of this chapter.

      (6)   Copies of all governmental permits required to construct
and operate the utility system described in the application.



   (E)   The city shall grant a revocable construction permit to
conduct such construction when, in the opinion of the city, the construction
and maintenance thereof will not interfere with any city facilities located
in the public rights-of-way.



   (F)   In granting a construction permit, the city may impose such
conditions as may be necessary for the management of the public
rights-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, for the
purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way; for the
proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures; for the
protection of the city, public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.



   (G)   Permittees must follow city-established requirements for
placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including the specific
location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and must in any event
install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of
the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing
facilities.



   (H)   Where circumstances dictate and consistent with the purposes
of this chapter, the city may require that facilities be installed at a
particular time, at a specific place or in a particular manner as a condition
of access to a particular public right-of-way. The city may:



      (1)   Deny access if a permittee is not willing to comply with
the city's requirements;



      (2)   Remove or require removal of any facility that is not
installed in compliance with the requirements established by the city or
which is installed without prior city approval of the time, place or manner

cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way
through joint trenching and other arrangements, including the imposition from
time to time of a moratorium on construction within the public rights-of-way.



   (I)   The construction of utility systems is subject to the
supervision of all city departments that have jurisdiction in such matters
and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental
rules and regulations and practices affecting such a system. However, except
for requirements subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a regulatory body
other than the city, the location, depth and other physical characteristics

to approval by the city and all backfilling, compaction and pavement
restoration performed for any excavation shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter.



   (J)   Notwithstanding the receipt of a construction permit,
construction shall not commence until all permit and registration
requirements have been met and all required permits and registrations have
been obtained, including the payment of all associated fees.



   (K)   To minimize disruption of public passage or infrastructure, to
forestall or relieve exhaustion of public rights-of-way capacity or to
protect environmentally sensitive areas, the city may require as a condition
of issuing any construction permit for erection of new poles or construction
of underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation of or
along any traveled way, that the permittee install pole space or empty
conduits in excess of its own present requirements that are sufficient to
meet the permittee's reasonably foreseeable requirements.



   (L)   At the time the construction permit is issued, the applicant
shall pay a non-refundable fee to defray the city's costs to process the
application and to inspect the construction (construction permit fee). The
amount of the fee shall be established by ordinance enacted by the city from
time to time. The construction permit fee may include costs incurred by the
city to maintain an inventory or database of facilities that are installed,
repaired or removed during the construction for which the permit is issued.
In any case where the city determines that the construction permit fee is
excessive, the city may waive the construction permit fee in whole or in part.



   (M)   No construction permit shall be transferable and any attempt
to transfer a construction permit shall be void.



   (N)   Each construction permit shall state a time period for
completion of all the work to be done thereunder. The city may grant
extensions of time for good cause. A construction permit shall be void unless
the construction to be undertaken pursuant thereto is commenced within thirty
(30) days from the date of its issuance and the work diligently completed
thereafter.



   (O)   No person in violation of any material requirement of this
chapter shall be issued a construction permit nor shall any contractor or
agent apply for or be issued a construction permit on the person's behalf
until the outstanding violation is corrected or a plan for correction is
approved by the city, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
foregoing requirement is in addition to any penalty or remedy for violation
that may be imposed or sought by the city at law or equity.



   (P)   Any registrant maintaining facilities in the public
rights-of-way may proceed with repairs upon existing facilities without a
construction permit when emergency circumstances demand that the work be done
immediately. The person performing the work shall apply to the city for a
construction permit no later than the third working day after such work has
commenced. All emergency work requires prior telephone notification to the
city Police Department.



   (Q)   A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance
that does not require excavation in the public rights-of-way or which does
not block traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods between 8:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, or for more than two (2) hours during any
non-peak traffic period.

   (A)   All construction shall be performed in a manner consistent
with high industry standards.  Persons engaged in the construction of

their activities and shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for
preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or
nuisance to the public or to property.



   (B)   Upon order of the city, all work that does not comply with the
terms of the construction permit, including the approved plans or
specifications for or conditions upon the work or the requirements of this
chapter or other applicable law, shall be removed. The permittee shall bear
the cost of removal.



   (C)   Unless otherwise specified, all facilities shall be
constructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:



      (1)   Whenever all existing utilities are located underground
in an area in the city, a permittee who wishes to place its utility system in
the same area (in whole or in part) must also locate its utility system
underground, including facilities (such as drops) which cross private
property.



      (2)   Whenever the owner of a pole within a public
right-of-way locates or relocates the facilities on that pole underground
within an area of the city, every operator of a utility system located within
the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground.



      (3)   Whenever the city opens a trench for the purpose of
installing or relocating facilities, each operator of a utility system shall
concurrently relocate its facilities underground. The city and each operator
shall bear its own relocation costs.



   (D)   Nothing herein prohibits the city from requiring all utility
systems to be placed underground in a particular area at any time, it being
the intent that the number and extent of overhead facilities will, over time,
be reduced and eventually, to the extent feasible, eliminated. No fee or
requirement authorized or imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be construed
to affect or alter in any way any obligation of public and private utilities
with facilities installed in any street, alley, sidewalk or other public
place to relocate the facilities at no cost to the city in the event that
relocation is required by the city to accommodate a proper governmental use
of the street, alley, sidewalk or other public place.



   (E)   The city may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular system
or facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or relocate
facilities underground where relocation is impractical or where the interests
in protecting safety and avoiding visual blight can be protected in another
manner.



   (F)   Any and all public rights-of-way, public property or private
property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction of a utility
system shall be promptly repaired by the operator of the utility system the
construction of which disturbed or damaged the public rights-of-way, public
property or private property. In such instances, public property and public
rights-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the city or to a
condition at least as good as before the disturbance or damage occurred.



   (G)   An operator shall comply with city ordinances concerning trees
if and when it trims trees and shrubbery upon and overhanging streets and
other public property. At the city's request, trimming shall be done under
the supervision and direction of the city.



   (H)   Within forty-eight (48) hours after notice from the city, the
operator of a utility system shall remove any graffiti on any part of its
utility system, including, by way of example and not limitation,  equipment
cabinets. If the operator fails to do so, the city may remove the graffiti
and bill the operator for the cost thereof.



   (I)   Construction work shall be publicized as the city may direct
from time to time. The publication of work may be used to notify the public
and operators of utility systems and in order to minimize inconvenience and
disruption to the public.



   (J)   The city may from time to time, when the city receives
application for a construction permit to use a particular route, designate by
published order a route or proposed route for installation of utility
facilities and may:



      (1)   Require all persons who wish to install underground
facilities along that route or any part thereof to install them during a
specified period; and



      (2)   Otherwise prohibit installation of such facilities along
the route or any part thereof for six (6) months or after such other, longer
period as is necessary to protect the public. In publishing an order, the
city shall provide at least thirty (30) days' notice of the need to install
facilities along the specified route or any part thereof during the specified
time period.

§ 102.23  RELOCATION OF UTILITY SYSTEMS.



   (A)   An operator of a utility system shall, by a time specified by
the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove any of
its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions;
public safety; public rights-of-way construction; public rights-of-way repair
(including resurfacing or widening); change of public rights-of-way grade;
construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power
lines, signal lines, tracks or any other type of government-owned utility
system; public work; public facility or improvement or any government-owned
utility; public rights-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the
city determines that the work involved would be aided by the removal or
relocation of the utility system (collectively referred to as the “public
work”).



   (B)   Except in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide
written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least
one (1) week prior to the deadline by which an operator of a utility system
must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its
facilities. An operator of a utility system may seek an extension of the time
to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in a week even with the
exercise of due diligence and such request for an extension shall not be
unreasonably refused.



   (C)   In the event of an emergency or where a utility system creates
or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the
city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate any or
all parts of the utility system without prior notice and charge the operator
of the utility system for costs incurred.



   (D)   If any person who is authorized to construct utility systems
in the public rights-of-way requests another operator of a utility system to
protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate its facilities
to accommodate the construction of the facilities of such other person, the
operator of the utility system shall, after fifteen (15) days' advance
written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless
the matter is governed by a valid contract or a federal, state or local law
or regulation or unless the facility that is being requested to be moved was
not properly installed, the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the
person requesting the protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal
or relocation and at no charge to the city, even if the city makes the
request for such action.



   (E)   An operator of a utility system shall, on the request of any
person holding a valid construction permit issued by a governmental
authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of
buildings or other objects. The expense of such temporary removal or raising
or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. An
operator of a utility system shall be given not less than forty-eight (48)
hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.



   (F)   An operator of a utility system may abandon any of its
property within public rights-of-way upon written notice to the city.
However, the operator must remove its property by a date specified by the
city if it determines, within ninety (90) days of the receipt of notice of
abandonment from the operator, that the safety, appearance, functioning or
use of the public rights-of-way and facilities in the public rights-of-way
will be adversely affected.  If the operator fails to comply with such a
request in a timely manner, the city may undertake to remove the property at
the operator's expense.

§ 102.24  TESTING OF UTILITY SYSTEMS AND REPORTING AND REPAIR REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Every utility system shall be subject to the right of periodic
inspection and testing by the city to determine compliance with the
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. The city shall have the
right, upon request, to be notified and present when the utility system is
tested by the operator. Each operator must respond to requests for
information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may
from time to time issue, which shall be a reasonably related to compliance or
enforcement of this chapter and may include requests for information
regarding its plans for construction and the purposes for which new
facilities are being constructed.



   (B)   Each operator of a utility system shall be required to provide
to the city, upon reasonable request and in a timely manner, the location of
its facilities in the public rights-of-way. Each operator of a utility system
is required to promptly repair any of its facilities located in the public
rights-of-way upon notification from the city that such facility poses a
public safety risk.

liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation
or maintenance of the utility system;

benefits and including all expenses incurred in defending against any such
claims or demands which may arise out of or be caused by the construction,
maintenance, operation, presence, use, rearrangement or removal of the
utility system or by the proximity of that utility system to the city's
facilities or by any act of the operator of a utility system on or in the
vicinity of the city's facilities;



      (3)   To indemnify and hold harmless the city, its trustees,
elected and appointed officers, agents and employees from and against any and
all claims, demands or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature and the
resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities,
damages, orders, judgments or decrees sustained by the city or any third
party arising out of or by reason of or resulting from or of the acts, errors
or omissions of the permittee or the operator of the utility system or its
agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising
out of the construction, maintenance, operation, presence, use, rearrangement
or removal of the utility system;



      (4)    Not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city
in connection with the matters addressed in this section; and



      (5)    To provide that the covenants and representations
relating to the indemnification provision shall survive the term of any

information. The city may examine the operator's books and records for
purposes of compliance with this chapter.



   (G)   An operator shall make available to the city for the city to

division (B) of this section, plus the sales factor, described in division
(C) of this section, and the denominator of which is two (2); and



      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than
one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as
set forth in division (C) of this section.



   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is
the total amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the
business entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the
individual's service is performed within the city.



   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period,
and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business
entity everywhere during the tax period.



      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal
property is in the city if:



         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a
purchaser, other than the United States government, or to the designee of the
purchaser within the city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions
of the sale; or



         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store,
warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the city.



      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease
or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real
property, are apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of
which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within
the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that
income- producing activity.



      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real
property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located.



   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:



      (1)   Separate accounting;



      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;



      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors
which will fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the
city; or



      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an
equitable allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.



   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license fee shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or
payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the
city. The license fee shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this
subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.



   (F)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where
income is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The
occupational license fee imposed in this chapter is assessed against income
before it is “passed through” these entities to the owners.



   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or
withdraws from the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in
any manner surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the
dissolution, cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of
charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and
collection of any occupational license fee for the period of that taxable
year during which the business entity had business activity in the city.



   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal
income tax return, the occupational license fee shall be computed for the
purposes of this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year
required by the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of
accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

§ 110.05  EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.



   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee
shall deduct and withhold from the compensation an occupational license fee
calculated under division (C) of this chapter. Amounts withheld shall be paid
to the city in accordance with this section.



   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold fees under this
section shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter
ending thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of
each quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the
fees required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is
permitted or required to report within a reasonable time after some other
period as determined by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any taxpayer
whose gross payroll exceeds one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00)
per three (3)-month quarter shall file returns on a monthly basis and shall
pay to the city the tax liability due hereunder on a monthly basis for
receipt on or before the 15th day of each month rather than on a quarterly
basis.



   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any
sums required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to
be withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.



   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any
employer who fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be
withheld under this chapter. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the
amounts withheld to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the
amounts withheld were required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails
to withhold, the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the
employer is assessed by the city.



   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold fees under this
chapter shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and
file on a form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the
occupational license fee withheld where compensation is paid or payable to
employees. Either copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage
and tax statements, or a detailed employee listing with the required
equivalent information, as determined by the city, shall be submitted.



   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or
before January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and
occupational license fee deducted by the employer from the compensation paid
to the employee for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.



   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the fees
required to be deducted and withheld under this section.



   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any
other person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity
subject to this section shall be personally and individually liable, both
jointly and severally, for any fee required to be withheld from compensation
paid or payable to one (1) or more employees of the business entity, and
neither the corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from
the city, nor the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge
that liability; provided that the personal and individual liability shall
apply to each and every person holding the corporate office at the time the
fee becomes or became obligated. No person shall be personally and
individually liable under this subsection unless such person had authority to
collect, truthfully account for, or pay over the fee imposed by this chapter
at the time that the fees imposed by this chapter become or became due.



   (I)   Notwithstanding subsections (G) and (H) of this section, every
employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the fee imposed under
§ 110.03 of this chapter shall be personally liable for any amount due. In
all cases where the employer does not withhold the fee levied under this
chapter from the employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible
for filing with the city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the
employer.

§ 110.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.



   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year

a fiscal year, which shall be filed by the fifteenth day of the fourth month
following the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns shall be
supplied by the city.



   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal
income tax return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of
filing its occupational license fee return with the city. Whenever, in the
opinion of the city, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return
of any business entity in order to audit the return, the city may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The city
may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.



   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license fee
governed by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under
oath statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to
time may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may
require a business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a
return, render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems
sufficient to determine the fees owed by the business entity pursuant to this
chapter.



   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge in the premises.



   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid fees payable by any business
entity, as appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at
the time prescribed for filing the occupational license fee return,
determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return.

§ 110.07  EXTENSIONS.



   (A)   The city may grant any business entity an extension of not
more than six (6) months, unless a longer extension has been granted by the
Internal Revenue Service or is agreed to by the city and the business entity,
for filing its return, if the business entity, on or before the date
prescribed for payment of the occupational license fee, requests the
extension and pays the amount properly estimated as its fee.



   (B)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business
shall pay, as part of the fee, an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) per
annum simple interest on the fee shown due on the return, but not been
previously paid, from the time the fee was due until the return is actually
filed and the fee paid to the city. A fraction of a month is counted as an
entire month.

taxable year fee liability;



      (2)   Twenty-five percent (25%) of the preceding full year
taxable year fee liability; or



      (3)   Twenty-five percent (25%) of the average fee liability

payment required under division (B) of this section by the due date for the
quarterly payment shall pay an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) per annum
simple interest on the amount of the quarterly payment required under
division (B) of this section from the earlier of:



      (1)   The due date for the quarterly payment until the time
when the aggregate quarterly payments submitted for the taxable year equal
the minimum aggregate payments due under division (B) of this section; or



      (2)   The due date of the annual return.



      (3)   A fraction of a month is counted as an entire month.

overpayment was made.



   (B)   An employee who has compensation attributable to activities

compensation attributable to activities performed outside the city prior to
approval of the refund.



   (C)   Where there has been an overpayment of net profits fees upon

   (E)   (1)   Overpayment resulting from the payment of estimated
fee in excess of the amount determined to be due upon the filing of a return

§ 110.10  FEDERAL AUDIT PROVISIONS.



   (A)   As soon as practicable after each return is received, the city
may examine and audit the return. If the amount of fee computed by the city
is greater than the amount returned by the business entity, the additional
fee shall be assessed and a notice of assessment mailed to the business
entity by the city within five (5) years from the date the return was filed,
except as otherwise provided in this section.



      (1)   In the case of a failure to file a return or of a
fraudulent return the additional fees may be assessed at any time.



      (2)   In the case of a return where a business entity
understates net profit, or omits an amount properly includable in net
profits, or both, which understatement or omission, or both, is in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of net profit stated in the return,
the additional fees may be assessed at any time within six (6) years after
the return was filed.



      (3)   In the case of an assessment of additional fees relating
directly to adjustments resulting from a final determination of a federal

receives the final determination of the federal audit from the business
entity, whichever is later.

agreement between the business entity and the city. For the purposes of this
subsection, a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for filing

granted for filing the return shall also be considered as extending the last
day prescribed by law for filing the return.

determination of the federal audit within thirty (30) days of the conclusion
of the federal audit.

may be refunded or credited within two (2) years of the date prescribed by
law for the filing of a return or the date the money was paid to the city,
whichever is the later, except that:



      (1)   In any case where the assessment period contained in §

the person's business. This prohibition does not extend to information
required in prosecutions for making false reports or returns for taxation, or

from testifying in any court, or from introducing as evidence returns or
reports filed with the tax district, in an action for violation of a tax
district tax laws or in any action challenging a tax district's tax laws.



   (B)   The city reserves the right to disclose to the Commissioner of
Revenue of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or his or her duly authorized agent
all such information and rights to inspect any of the books and records of

not to reveal data respecting net profits or compensation of any person.



   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar
reciprocity agreements as described in division (B) of this section with any
other taxing entity, should there be a need for exchange of information in
order to effect diligent enforcement of this chapter.

§ 110.15  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



   In the event any person, firm, corporation, partnership or other entity
fails or refuses for any reason to pay when due any fee imposed or required

chapter, that the location is one that can be approved, including but not
limited to the requirements of KRS 243.220, that a license may be issued

beverages, he may issue to the applicant a written order setting forth such
violation and requiring the applicant to show cause why the requested license

(Ord. passed 5-7-92)



§ 118.41  LICENSE TO BECOME VOID IF BUSINESS DORMANT; LICENSE RENEWAL.



   (A)   Conditions for dormancy.  Under the provisions of KRS, all
administrative regulations promulgated pursuant to the provisions of KRS and
this chapter, as may be amended from time to time, a quota system may exist
for the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages in the city. 
Therefore, it is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by the license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days.  Because a licensee, like any
other business, may have his business interrupted by situations not under his
control, various exceptions to this dormancy rule are included in subsection
(B).



   (B)   Surrender of license and exceptions.  Any license under which
no business is transacted during a period of ninety (90) days shall become
null and void.  At the expiration of the ninety (90) day period the license
shall be surrendered to the City Administrator, except that any licensee who
is unable to continue in business at the licensed premises may apply to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Department, pursuant to
804 KAR 4:1110, as amended from time to time, to continue such license in
dormancy.  In the event a period of dormancy is applied for or granted by
the Administrator to the licensee, the licensee shall immediately notify the
City Administrator.  Upon resumption of business or transfer or assignment
of the license, the licensee shall notify the City Administrator and a fee
shall be due and payable to the City Administrator for the period the license
was in dormancy in the same amount due had the license remained active for
the same period.



   (C)   Applications based on pending construction of development. 
Applications approved by the City Administrator and based on pending
construction or development on the premises shall be null and void after
ninety (90) days of the commitment to issue a license if the applicant fails
to proceed in an orderly fashion to initiate construction or development on
the premises involved.  Extensions may be granted by the Administrator as he
deems appropriate in exercise of his sound discretion based on facts and
circumstances surrounding each request.



   (D)   Renewals, time for filing.  All renewal of licenses and
payment of the license fee must be on file with the City Administrator
fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the licenses for the preceding
license period or the license shall be canceled, except that the licensee may
file a written, verified statement fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration
date of the license, setting forth the facts justifying an extension.  The
Administrator may then extend the time for filing of a renewal of the license
for a reasonable length of time within the exercise of his sound
discretion.  The licensee shall pay the license fee from the expiration date
of the former license or licenses and payment shall be refunded to the
licensee in the event that the license or licenses are not renewed at or
before the end of the extension period.



(Ord. passed 5-7-92)



§ 118.42  CAUSES FOR REFUSAL TO ISSUE OR RENEW LICENSE; SUSPENSION OR
REVOCATION OF LICENSE.



   (A)   State Law References.  Causes for refusal to issue or renew a
license and for suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same
as provided for state licenses according to KRS 243.450 and 243.500, as well
as violation of any city ordinance regarding alcoholic beverage licensing,
sales, or the administration of licenses.



   (B)   Delinquent Taxes or Fees.  No license to sell alcoholic or
malt beverages shall be granted or renewed to any person who is delinquent in
the payment of any taxes or fees due the city at the time of issuing the
license; nor shall any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any
premises or property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are
any delinquent taxes or fees due the city.  If a licensee becomes delinquent
in the payment of any taxes or any fees due the city at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be
subject to revocation or suspension.  The City Administrator may, in his
discretion, approve a license to sell after receiving from the City
Treasurer, a written statement to the effect that the applicant for the
license has paid or has made satisfactory arrangements with the City
Treasurer for taking care of the indebtedness represented by the unpaid and
delinquent taxes or fees.  This section shall apply only to taxes and fees
which are due and payable by the licensee.



   (C)   Restrictions on Package Liquor License.  No retail package
liquor license shall be issued for any premises unless the applicant
certifies under oath that ninety (90) per cent of the total projected gross
receipts from sale made at the licensed premises during the twelve (12) month
period following the issuance of the license shall consist of the projected
gross receipts from sales of alcoholic beverages.  No retail package liquor
shall be renewed for any premises unless ninety (90) per cent of its gross
receipts from sales for the immediate past month and the immediate past
twelve (12) months have been derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages.



   (D)   Appeals.  Appeals may be taken from decisions of the City
Administrator to the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board according to the
provisions of KRS 241.200 and 243.550.

of insuring full reimbursement to the city for the cost of any additional
policing, regulatory, or administrative expenses related to the sale of
alcoholic beverages in the city.  The City Council shall adopt, at the
budget adoption for the fiscal year, an annual rate for the regulatory
license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to insure full reimbursement to
the city for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or
administrative expenses related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the

manner required by the rules and regulations of the State Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board, or such rules and regulations as may be from time to time
promulgated by the City Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator and approved
by a majority of a quorum of the City Council.  Where the sales of alcoholic
beverages as they relate to other sales are determinative of the licensee's

to show that relationship.  The books and records shall be available at all
reasonable times for inspection by the City Alcoholic Beverage Control
Administrator, the Director of Finance, or any authorized representatives.

§ 119.02  INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.



   (A)   Notice.  Upon the adoption of this chapter and the
certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all
cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic
service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.



   (B)   Cable operator response.  Within thirty (30) days of
receiving notice from the city, a cable operator shall file its current rates
for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting
material concerning the reasonableness of its rates with the city.



   (C)   Expedited determination and public hearing.



      (1)   If the city council is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated
equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the
applicable benchmark, the city council shall:



         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons
may express their views; and



         (b)   Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days
from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city.



      (2)   If the city council takes no action within thirty (30)
days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the
city, the proposed rates will continue in effect.



   (D)   Extended review period.



      (1)   If the city council is unable to determine whether the
rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the
material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service
showing, the city council shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a
formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as
applicable, to make a final determination:



         (a)   Ninety (90) days if the city council needs more
time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or



         (b)   One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator
has submitted a cost- of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the
applicable benchmark.



      (2)   If the city council has not made a decision within the
ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) day period, the city council shall
issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable
operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the
proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.



   (E)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before
taking action on the proposed rate, the city council shall hold at least one
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.



   (F)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an
objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the city secretary
to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection
in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for
an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the
city secretary with the objector's name and address.



   (G)   Benchmark analysis.  If a cable operator submits its current
basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable
rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based
on the city council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:



      (1)   If the current basic rates are below the benchmark,
those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable
operator's rates will be capped at that level.



      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on
September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10%) percent, or the applicable
benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels
occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.



      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on
September 30, 1992, the initial basic rate shall be the benchmark adjusted
for inflation.



   (H)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator does not wish
to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the
opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify
initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city
council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards
for cost-of-service review.  The city council may approve initial basic
cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below
the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus
ten (10%) percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.



   (I)   Decision.



      (1)   By formal resolution.  After completion of its review
of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution.  The decision shall include one of the
following:



         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council
shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or



         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the
proposed rates, the city council shall establish initial basic cable rates
that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a
cost-of-service analysis.



      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds.  If the city council determines
that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate
standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower
rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with
subsection (G) or (H), as applicable.  In addition, the city council may
order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive
portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by
the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments),
retroactive to September 1, 1993.  The method for paying any refund and the
interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the
city council's decision resolution.



      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. 
If rates proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or
if there were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the
resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the city council must
give public notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by
advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city.



   (J)   Appeal.  The city council's decision concerning rates for the
basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in
accordance with applicable federal regulations.



(Ord. 94-01, passed 2-7-94)



§ 119.03  REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR RATE INCREASE.



   (A)   Notice.  A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase
the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a
request with the city and notify all subscribers at least thirty (30) days
before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect.  This notice
may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year
after the determination of the initial basic cable rates.



   (B)   Expediteddeterminationandpublichearing.



      (1)   If the city council is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
price cap, the city council shall:



         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons
may express their views; and



         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty
(30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city.



      (2)   If the city council takes no action within thirty (30)
days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the
proposed rates will go into effect.



   (C)   Extended review period.



      (1)   If the city council is unable to determine whether the
rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the
material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service
showing, the city council shall by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke
the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:



         (a)   Ninety (90) days if the city council needs more
time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and



         (b)   One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator
has submitted a cost- of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase
above the applicable price cap.



      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended
review period.



      (3)   If the city council has not made a decision within the
ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) day period, the city council shall
issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable
operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the
proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.



   (D)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before
taking action on the requested rate increase, the city council shall hold at
least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.



   (E)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an
objection to the proposed rate increase may request the city secretary to
record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in
writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an
objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city
secretary with the objector's name and address.



   (F)   Delayed determination.  If the city council is unable to make
a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the
extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect,
subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision
disapproving any portion of the increase.



   (G)   Price cap analysis.  If a cable operator presents its request
for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city
council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with
the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on the city council's
findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows:



      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the
price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new
basic cable rates.



      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the
price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the
proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the
price cap.



   (H)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator submits a
cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the
price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC
standards for cost-of-service review.  The city council may approve a rate
increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below
the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate prescribe the
cable operator's new rate.



   (I)   Decision.  The city council's decision concerning the
requested rate increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution.  If a rate
increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or
if the objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase,
the resolution must state the reasons for the decision.  Objections may be
made at the public hearing by a person requesting the city secretary to
record the objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the
decision resolution is adopted.

within the extended time period as described in subsection (C); and



         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase
at the end of the extended review period; and



         (c)   The city council determines that the rate increase
as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator
failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the
city council disapproves any portion of the rate increase.



      (2)   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate
will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's
decision resolution.

§ 119.04  CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.



   (A)   City may require.



      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted
initial rate or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate
standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce
information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information,
if needed to make a rate determination.  In these cases, a cable operator
may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this
section.



      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the
reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information
only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with
the standard.



   (B)   Request for confidentiality.



      (1)   A cable operator submitting information to the city
council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely
available for public inspection.  A copy of the request shall be attached to
and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which
it applies.



      (2)   If feasible, the information to which the request
applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the
request does not apply.  If this is not feasible, the portion of the
information to which the request applies shall be identified.



      (3)   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons
for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those
reasons are based.



      (4)   Casual requests which do not comply with the
requirements of this subsection, shall not be considered.



   (C)   City council action.  Requests which comply with the
requirements of subsection (B), will be acted upon by the city council.  The
city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a
preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with
applicable federal regulations.  If the request is granted, the ruling will
be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public
inspection.  If the request does not present a case for non-disclosure and
the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the
following actions:



      (1)   If the information has been submitted voluntarily
without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the
city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will
comply with this request.  Only in the unusual instance that the public
interest so requires will the information be made available for public
inspection.



      (2)   If the information was required to be submitted by the
city council, the information will be made available for public inspection.



   (D)   Appeal. If the city council denies the request for
confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the
FCC within five (5) working days of the city council's decision, and the
release of the information will be stayed pending review.



(Ord. 94-01, passed 2-7-94)



§ 119.05  AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring
changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be
adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to
regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first.  The permitted per
channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees
or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994.



   (C)   Notification and review.  The cable operator shall notify the
city at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on
automatic adjustment items.  The city shall review the increase to determine
whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments.  If the city
makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the
increase, the increase may go into effect.

subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following
circumstances:

determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual

   (A)   Any taxpayer who believes that he has made or permitted an
overpayment of his or her liability for any restaurant tax required by this
chapter may apply for a refund of said overpayment provided that he or she
files an amended return, verified under oath and setting forth in detail the
full explanation of the reason of the said claimed overpayment, within one
year of the date of said overpayment is made or the date he or she said
restaurant tax payment was due, whichever occurs first.



   (B)   If a refund has been properly claimed according to the
provisions hereof, the City Director of Finance shall have the authority to
honor and refund any such overpayment actually made above actual liability
upon the restaurant tax required under this chapter which he or she

inadvertence without interest thereon.

§ 123.10  FAILURE TO FILE RETURN, FAILURE TO PAY THE RESTAURANT TAX
WITHHELD, UNDERPAYMENT OF AMOUNT DUE.



   (A)   If the taxpayer liable for collecting the restaurant tax and
filing a return fails to file a return, the City Director of Finance shall
prepare an estimate of the amount of restaurant taxes due based on the best
information available to him or her. The City Director of Finance may make
investigations to assist in making the estimate. He or she may consider the
volume of business done in the same type of business, and any other relevant
matters. When the City Director of Finance estimates the restaurant taxes,
the amount of interest and late charges provided by this chapter shall be
added to the taxes due. He or she shall notify the taxpayer of the amount
due. Such notification shall be in writing and shall contain a brief
description of the method and estimated figures used in arriving at the
estimated tax. Any taxpayer may dispute the amount of the estimated tax by
filing within 30 days of notification of the estimated taxes a return
accompanied by payment of the entire balance due together with the interest
and late charges due. Such return shall be processed like any late return,
and shall establish the restaurant tax liability of the taxpayer in place of
the estimated amount prepared by the City Director of Finance. However, the
Director may later determine that the amount shown in the return is
insufficient so there is a deficiency, in the same manner as in the case of
other returns.



   (B)   If the City Director of Finance determines, by examining
available evidence, that the amount of restaurant taxes paid by the taxpayer
is less than the amount required by this chapter, he or she shall notify the
taxpayer of the deficiency. The City Director of Finance may use any of the
methods authorized in division (A) of this section to determine whether a
deficiency exists and to determine the amount of such deficiency. He or she
shall thereupon notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. Such notice shall be
in writing and shall state not only the amount of the deficiency but also the
methods and estimates used in arriving at the amount of the deficiency. If
the taxpayer does not object in writing within 30 days of the date of
receiving such notice, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have accepted the
revised figures for the restaurant tax liability. If the taxpayer does file
written objection within the time specified, the taxpayer shall pay the fees,
together with penalties and interest, under protest and may thereupon pursue
administrative and judicial remedies as provided by this chapter and by state
law to seek a refund.



   (C)   If the City Director of Finance finds that any taxpayer has
overpaid, he or she shall notify them of overpayment and shall refund the
amount of the overpayment to them without interest thereon.



   (D)   When the City Director of Finance notifies any taxpayer of any
estimated amount due, alleged overpayment, or refund, he or she shall include
in the notice clear instructions on how, when, and where the taxpayer may
protest or appeal the decision.



   (E)   If any taxpayer or any person, firm, association, or
corporation required by this chapter to pay a restaurant tax or to file a
return shall fail to file any return for any month, such failure to file
shall constitute a continuing offense against the city and the City Director
of Finance may proceed to estimate and collect the restaurant taxes at any
time.



   (F)   If a taxpayer fails to pay the restaurant tax due pursuant to
this chapter and such failure continues for more than 90 days after written
notice thereof, the city shall have the right to suspend such taxpayer’s
license to transact business within the city until all taxes, interest and
penalties due pursuant to this chapter have been paid in full.



   (G)   The City of Madisonville shall have a lien upon all property,
real and personal, of any restaurant to secure the unpaid tax receipts due
from that restaurant, which lien shall be perfected by filing a notice of the
tax due and a statement of lien in the office of the Hopkins County Court
Clerk’s Office.



   (H)   In the event the City of Madisonville is required to file suit
or take other legal action to collect the sums due pursuant to this chapter,
the city shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and costs
actually incurred associated therewith.

   The Mobile Food Administrator or his or her designee may suspend or

abide by the provisions hereof or if any required health license has been
suspended or revoked. The Mobile Food Administrator or his or her designee

mail, return receipt requested. The hearing before the Madisonville City

revocation of the permit at which time the permittee shall be afforded the
opportunity to his or her version of the facts after which time the

warranting the revocation or suspension of the license or permit. The person
filing the notice of appeal shall be advised in writing of the hearing date,
time and place for the hearing by regular first class mail. Any person or
entity adversely affected by any decision of the Madisonville City Council

date, time and place by regular mail and shall be afforded the opportunity to

chapter causing the permit to be denied or that a violation of this chapter
has occurred warranting the revocation of the permit. Any person or entity
adversely affected by any decision of the Madisonville City Council shall

inspector, or otherwise, that he has sufficient knowledge of the matter to
properly perform such work.  If it is apparent from the character of the
work performed that an owner is not competent or qualified to do the work,
under any permit issued to him, the inspector may require such portion of the
work that is in violation hereof to be changed, altered, or repaired by a

      (1)   At the time of such notification, the person making such
installation, repair, or alteration of electric wiring or equipment shall
attach thereto a notice in substantially the following form:  "Warning: 
This work has not been inspected and approved by the Electrical Inspector and
it shall not be covered or concealed until so inspected and approved."



      (2)   No person other than the inspector shall thereafter
remove the notice, nor shall the inspector remove the same until he has
attached to the work a notice stating that same has been inspected and
approved.



   (D)   Procedure on condemnation of work.  Should the inspector
condemn any of the work or equipment as not being in accordance with the
provisions hereof, notice in writing shall be given by him to the person
engaged in the work and within ten (10) days after notification thereof, or
within further reasonable time as may, on request, be prescribed, such
condemned work or equipment shall be altered or removed as the case may
require, the necessary changes shall be made so that all such work or
equipment shall fully comply with the provisions hereof.



   (E)   Penalties.  In default thereof the person shall be liable for
the penalties as provided in this chapter and every owner, contractor, or
other person engaged in the construction of the building structure, or
otherwise, covering or allowing to be covered such portion of the work or
equipment, or removing any notice not to cover same placed thereon by the
inspector, shall be likewise liable for the same penalties.

equipment is found to be in a dangerous or unsafe condition, the person
owning, using, or operating the same shall be notified to make the necessary
repairs or changes required to place such wiring, appliance, device, fixture,
or equipment in a safe condition, and shall have such work completed within
ten (10) days after notification thereof, or within such further reasonable
time as may, on request, be prescribed.  All electrical wiring, apparatus,
or equipment within or attached to any building within the limits of the fire

of the regulations; is not generally applicable to other property; does not
in any manner vary from provisions of the zoning ordinance or other adopted

DESIGN STANDARDS



§ 155.65  PURPOSE.



   Subdivisions shall be designed to create desirable neighborhoods with
peace, quiet, safety, and beauty wherein suitable residential, commercial, or
industrial values may be maintained over a long period of time.  These
minimum standards are established to promote this purpose.



(Ord. passed 5-22-03)



§ 155.66  DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER.



   Lands unsuitable for development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, adverse topography, utility easements, inadequate off-site
infrastructure, or other features which are harmful to the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas shall not be
subdivided or developed unless adequate solutions to solve the problems
created by unsuitable land conditions are provided by the applicant.



(Ord. passed 5-22-03)



§ 155.67  STREETS.



   (A)   Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of
streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the
principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper projection
where adjoining land is not subdivided).  Offset streets should be
avoided.  The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle.  All proposed
street names shall avoid duplication or close approximation of other street
names in the entire county unless the proposed street is obviously intended
as an extension of another existing or proposed street, in which case the
streets shall bear the same name.



   (B)   Design. The arrangement of streets and lots shall give due
regard to the topography and other physical features of the property and
shall meet the following requirements and standards:



      (1)   See Appendix B of this chapter for Minimum Street Design
Standards Table.



      (2)   Base and surface. All streets and public ways shall be
constructed in accordance with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet's
Standards for Road and Bridge Construction. The minimum shall consist of 12
inches of compacted subgrade, six inches of compacted Dense Grade Aggregate
(DGA), three inches bituminous binder and one inch bituminous surface.



      (3)   Right-of-way.



         (a)   See Appendix B of this chapter.



         (b)   Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall
dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum width requirements. 
The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision
is on both sides of the existing street.  When the subdivision is located on
only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way,
measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided.



      (4)   Alleys. Alleys may be allowed in a residential block but
only as a secondary means of access to property and not as the road frontage
or primary means of access.  Alleys are allowed in the rear of business
lots, unless other adequate provisions are made for service and deliveries,
and shall have a right-of-way no greater than 20 feet.



      (5)   Sight distance. See Appendix Bof this chapter.



      (6)   Design speed. See Appendix B of this chapter.



      (7)   Grades. See Appendix B of this chapter.  Grades at
intersections shall not exceed 3% for a distance of 50 feet from the
intersection of the street centerlines.



      (8)   Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than
ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve or reasonably long
radius shall be introduced.  On streets 60 feet or more in width, the
centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than 300 feet; on other
streets, not less than 100 feet at a design speed of 20 mph.  Greater design
speeds shall require appropriate radii determined in accordance with AASHTO
guidelines.



      (9)   Vertical curves. See Appendix B of this chapter.  Every
change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to
afford a minimum sight distance being measured from the driver's eyes, which
are assumed to be 4.5 feet above the pavement surface, to an object four
inches high on the pavement.  Profiles of all streets showing natural and
finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 50 feet
horizontal, and one inch equals five feet vertical, is required.



      (10)   Intersections. See Appendix B of this chapter.  Street
intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible, and no
intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees.  Property line
radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20 feet, and where the
angle of street intersections is less than 75 degrees, the Planning
Commission may require a greater curb radius.  Wherever necessary to permit
the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the
sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at
such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to
permit such construction.  Intersections involving more than four basic
street approaches are prohibited.



      (11)   Tangents. See Appendix B of this chapter.



      (12)   Curb and gutter.



         (a)   Curbs shall be constructed in all major
subdivisions to provide permanent six inch concrete curbs with 24 inch
integral concrete gutters or standard rolled curbs and gutters.  Valley
gutters two feet wide shall be constructed meeting the same requirements as
the pavement base and prime coat of the adopted street specifications.  The
ground between valley gutters and the property line shall be adequately
sloped to the edge of the valley gutter.  Details of curb and gutter are
available in the Standards and Guidance for Development manual from the City
of Madisonville.



         (b)   Exception. A continuation of a currently active
development under the same ownership is not required to install curb and
gutter.



      (13)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of
less than 100 feet shall not be allowed.



      (14)   Dead end streets.



         (a)   Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have
one end permanently closed shall be determined by the density accessed from
said street as follows:



 


Use

 

Lengths



Single-family
 
60 feet per lot access/max 1,500 feet


Two-family
 
80 feet per lot access/max 1,250 feet


Multi-family
 
80 feet per lot access/max 1,000 feet


Commercial
 
50 feet per lot access/max 1,000 feet


Industrial
 
200 feet per lot access/max 1,200 feet



 



         (b)   Dead end streets shall be provided at the closed
end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least 60 feet
and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 80 feet, or the Planning
Commission may approve an alternative design so long as it meets these
regulations.  Where adjoining property is subject to future development,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such
property.  Such streets for extension shall be provided with a temporary
turn-around having a roadway diameter of at least 60 feet. Temporary
turn-around shall be paved within two years of the preliminary plat approval
unless the next final plat phase has been filed.



      (15)   Private streets and reserve strips. There shall be no
private streets or reserve strips platted in any subdivision.



      (16)   Blocks. No block shall be less than 250 feet nor more
than 1,500 feet in length, except as the Planning Commission considers
necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street
pattern.  Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots except where
reverse frontage on major streets and roads is provided or where prevented by
topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the Planning
Commission may approve a single row of lots of minimum depth.



      (17)   Dedication and acceptance. The subdivider shall provide
for the complete construction of the roads, streets, drainage, right-of-way,
and roadside improvements to adopted standards.  Five days written notice
shall be given to the City Engineer for a final inspection of the
construction.  Dedicated road systems shall not be accepted until inspected
by the City Engineer and determined that the improvements are constructed in
accordance with the approved construction plans.  Within 45 days of final
inspection by the City Engineer, the Council may accept the street by action
or by default.



      (18)   Restriction of access. Where property along a collector
or arterial street is to be used for residential purposes and a minor street
is required, the arrangement of lots shall be such that the lot's rear yards
abut the major street.



   (C)   Lots.



      (1)   Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a
building site outside the limits of any existing easement or building setback
lines as required, and above the elevation of the record flood.  Fill may be
used to raise such site to flood-free elevation.  The introduction of fill
shall require approval as necessary by the appropriate regulatory agency. 
Lot access shall be outside or above the record flood.



      (2)   Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall
be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curve street lines.



      (3)   Frontage. Each lot must front upon a publicly
dedicated/accepted or publicly maintained street or road for a distance as
established in the individual zoning districts, except that lots fronting on
the turn-around of a cul-de-sac street shall have a minimum frontage of 30
feet, unless otherwise specified in the adopted zoning regulations of the
City of Madisonville.



      (4)   Size. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be
such as to allow the installation of the required utilities and
infrastructure and as to allow adequate building sites.  Minimum sizes are
as established in the individual zoning districts.



      (5)   Sewer. The subdivider shall connect with the public
sanitary sewer system and provide connections to each lot.



      (6)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall have a width sufficient
to permit the establishment of front building lines on both the adjoining
streets without reducing the buildable width below that of the average size
lot in the subdivision.  One interior lot line shall be considered the rear
line and one shall be considered the side line determined by the positioning
of the principle structure.



      (7)   Building setback lines and side yards. All setbacks and
yards shall conform to the requirements of the zoning districts within the
City of Madisonville.



      (8)   Flag lots. Flag lots are not encouraged but shall be
allowed under the following guidelines:



         (a)   In no case shall there be more than two contiguous
flag lots;



         (b)   The minimum road frontage is required for each
flag lot;



         (c)   Where two flag lots are contiguous, only one
common driveway shall be allowed; and



         (d)   The maximum number of flag lots allowed in a
subdivision is three lots or 15% of the total number of lots, whichever is
greater.



      (9)   Utility easements. When the location of poles, wires,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water, or other utilities is
required along rear and/or side lot lines, easements of at least ten feet in
width along the rear lot lines and at least five feet in width along the side
lot lines shall be dedicated.  Easements of at least 20 feet shall be
dedicated along all rights-of-way except in the Central Business District
where the easement requirement will be determined by the Planning Commission.



   (D)   Parking facilities. Parking shall conform to the minimum
requirements of the adopted zoning regulations.



   (E)   Public use and service areas. Where a school, neighborhood
park or recreation area, shown on an official map or in a plan adopted by the
Planning Commission, is located in whole or in part in the applicant's
subdivision, the Planning Commission shall require the dedication or
reservation of such open space within the subdivision up to a total of 10% of
the gross area of the plat for park, school or recreation purposes.



   (F)   Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features such as large trees and water courses, and for
historical spots and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and value to the property.



   (G)   Cemeteries. Cemeteries shall be identified and require a ten
foot buffer/setback around the perimeter.



   (H)   Large tracts or parcels. When land is subdivided into larger
parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to
allow for the opening of streets in the future and for logical further
resubdivision.



   (I)   Deed restrictions/covenants. Deed restrictions or covenants
shall be included with the plat and made a part of such plat; provided
however, that such deed restrictions or covenants shall not contain
reversionary clauses wherein any lots shall return to the subdivider because
of a violation thereon of the terms of the restrictions or covenants, nor
shall they contain any requirements less strict than those of any locally
adopted regulation or ordinance.



   (J)   Easements along streams/watercourses. Whenever any stream or
important surface drainage course is located in an area which is being
subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement along each side
of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving or
protecting the stream or drainage course.  Under no circumstances shall the
easement be less than ten feet as measured outward from both stream banks at
the top of bank point.  Any alteration or other work performed on the
stream/watercourse shall be permitted by the appropriate agency.



   (K)   Sidewalks.



      (1)   Sidewalks shall be required in all major residential
subdivisions and shall be located in the street right-of-way, on both sides
of the street, to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls,
hedges or other planting or structures placed on the property line.  All
sidewalks shall be constructed as follows: concrete sidewalks shall be four
feet wide and four inches thick.



      (2)   Exception. A continuation of a currently active
development under the same ownership is not required to install sidewalks.



   (L)   Utilities.



      (1)   Street lights. Street lights shall be installed in
accordance with the Electric Utility Service Policies and Procedures.  Pole
spacing shall be determined by the Electric Department.



      (2)   Stop signs and street name signs. All stop signs and
street name signs are the responsibility of the developer and shall be
located on the preliminary plat, construction plans and final plat. 
Installation shall be in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control and city standards.



      (3)   Telephone, cable system, electric.



         (a)   All telephone, cable, and electric lines shall be
placed within the 20-foot utility easement adjacent to the public
right-of-way.



         (b)   Optional. All utility lines may be placed
underground in a trench with adequate pipe for joint use by any providers.



      (4)   Sanitary sewer system. Each lot within a subdivision
shall be provided with a connection to an approved sanitary sewer system. 
The design and construction of all sanitary sewer systems shall be in
accordance with the Standards Manual for the planning, design and
construction of sanitary sewage facilities.



      (5)   Water distribution system.



         (a)   Each lot within a subdivision shall be provided
with a connection to an approved water system.  The design and construction
of all water supply systems shall be in accordance with the Standards Manual
for the planning, design and construction of water distribution systems.



         (b)   Connections to the water system shall be installed
for every lot in a subdivision so that future connections will not require
digging up or tunneling under streets or interruption of service to other
connections on the system.  An adequate system of fire mains shall be
provided as part of the development.  Every attempt shall be made to
establish a gridiron layout, preferably looped, with a minimum of dead-end
lines.  Fire hydrants shall be spaced at a maximum of 500 feet apart so that
adequate fire protection to all buildings may be provided.  Fire hydrants
shall be located where they will be accessible, protected from traffic
hazards, and will not obstruct walks, roadways or parking facilities.



      (6)   Storm water drainage system.



         (a)   The plat shall be laid out so as to provide
drainage of the area being subdivided.  Drainage improvements shall maintain
any natural water course and shall prevent the collection of water in any low
areas.  The means for disposing of the storm water shall comply with all
KPDES, Phase II requirements.  The satisfactory drainage of storm water
shall be made by means of underground conduits or surface ditches.  The
storm water drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the
developer and shall be designed to meet the design specifications as outlined
in the City of Madisonville Standards and Guidance for Development Manual. 
Plans for improvements shall be prepared by the design engineer and installed
by the developer, all in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.



         (b)   An adequate drainage system, including ditches,
pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be
designed and constructed to provide for the proper drainage of the surface
water of the subdivision and the drainage area of which it is a part.  The
following requirements and methods shall be followed:



            1.   Report required.  A subdivision plat shall
not be considered for final approval until the subdivider has submitted a
report by the design engineer as to the ability of existing watercourse
channels, storm sewers, culverts, and other improvements pertaining to
drainage or flood control within the subdivision, in order to handle the
additional runoff created by the development of the land.  Additional
information shall be submitted indicating that provisions have been made for
the disposal of surface water without any damage to the developed or
underdeveloped land down stream of the proposed subdivision.  The use of
sink holes as runoff outlets is prohibited.  The report shall include an
estimate of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision naturally
from areas outside the subdivision and the quantities of flow at each pickup
point (inlet), and the location, sizes, and grades of required culverts,
drainage sewers, and other required appurtenances.



            2.   Grading.  No final grading or sidewalk, curb
and gutter, pavement construction, or installation of utilities shall be
permitted in any proposed subdivision until the preliminary plat has been
approved by the Planning Commission.  The subdivider shall grade each
subdivision in order to establish street, block, and lot grades in proper
relation to each other and to topography.  The grading of the roadway shall
extend the full width of the right-of-way.  Planting strips between the back
of curb and sidewalks shall be graded at a gradient of not less than 2%
upward from curb to sidewalk or property line.  All ditches shall be graded
to ensure the adequate flow of surface water runoff.



            3.   Design. Culverts and storm sewers in all
streets shall be designed on a ten-year, 24-hour storm event and checked for
a 100-year frequency to ensure no structures will be inundated by flood
waters.  The minimum capacity for curb and gutter inlets and open channels
shall be computed on a rainfall intensity of four inches per hour.  Ditches
shall be sloped not less than three to one and back slopes shall be not less
than two to one.  Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural
and post development water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit
full width roadway and the required slopes.  In no case shall the pipe be
less than 15 inches.  Cross drains shall be built on straight line and
grade, and shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the
flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a
smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the
roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top
of the pipe be less than one foot below the roadbed.



            4.   Road drainage. The road storm sewer system
shall serve as the primary drainage system and shall be designed to carry
roadway, adjacent land, and building storm drainage under developed
conditions.  No storm sewer shall be permitted to run into the sanitary
sewer system.  Curb drainage inlets and catch basins shall be provided at
intervals along roadways.  The spacing of inlets and catch basins shall be
adequate to limit the spread of water to two feet into the roadway.  Storm
drainage inlets shall be placed so that crosswalks will not be flooded during
the design intensity of four inches per hour. Ditches and open channels shall
be seeded or sodded and material and construction specifications for all
drainage projects shall be in compliance with KDOH. The post-development rate
of run-off shall not exceed the pre-development levels.



            5.   Off-road drainage. The design of the off-road
drainage system shall include the watershed affecting the subdivision and
shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm
drainage.  When the drainage system is outside of the road right-of-way, the
subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating an easement to provide for
the future maintenance of the system.  The size and location of all off-road
water courses and ditches running through the subdivision shall be enclosed
or left open subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.  If a water
course or ditch is left open, it may be required to be protected by a fence
as determined by the Planning Commission.  The watercourse or ditch easement
shall be wide enough to contain ample clearance for the operation of
maintenance equipment.



            6.   Protection of drainage systems.  Ditches and
open channels shall be seeded, sodded, or paved depending on grades/slopes
and types of soils.  As a general rule, ditches and channels with grades
between 4% to 8% shall be sodded and those with grades over 8% shall be paved.



            7.   Materials.  Material and construction
specifications for all drainage projects shall be in compliance with the
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction manual.



   (M)   Off-site improvements. When a proposed subdivision is located
on a road, sanitary sewer system, water line or storm water system determined
by the city to be substandard and incapable of handling the proposed
increase, the developer shall be advised and the proposed subdivision may not
proceed.  The city shall make no guarantee to make off-site improvements;
however, the developer and city may enter into an agreement to make off-site
improvements which would allow the proposed subdivision to be developed.



   (N)   Survey monuments. All subdivision boundary corners and all
points of tangency and points of curvature of all curves of streets and
street intersections shall be marked with permanent monuments.  A permanent
monument shall consist of ½ inch minimum diameter steel rod or rebar of 24
inch minimum length with an SPPLS identifying cap encased in a concrete
filled six inch minimum diameter hole of two feet minimum depth.  Should
conditions prohibit the placing of monuments on the line, witness
monumentation will be permitted; provided however, that exact offset courses
and distances are shown on the subdivision plat.  Steel rods or rebar of ½
inch minimum diameter and a minimum of 18 inch length with SPPLS identifying
cap shall be set at all lot corners.  If survey monuments are removed during
construction, they shall be replaced before the final plat is recorded,
unless bonded.



   (O)   Surety/bond.



      (1)   Requirement. No final plat of any subdivision shall be
submitted, approved, and recorded unless:



         (a)   The improvements have been installed to the
satisfaction of the city prior to such approval; or



         (b)   The subdivider has entered into a contract with
the Hopkins County Joint Planning Commission and satisfactory to the city to
construct all necessary roads, drainage, grading, graveling, paving, storm
and sanitary sewerage systems, and water systems; and the subdivider has
filed with the Planning Commission a property or insurance bond, letter of
credit, cashier's check, or a certified check upon a solvent Kentucky bank
conditioned to secure the construction of the improvements listed below in a
satisfactory manner not to exceed two years.  No such bond shall be accepted
unless it is enforceable by or payable to the Hopkins County Joint Planning
Commission in a sum at least 120% of the cost of constructing the
improvements as estimated by the design engineer with the approval of the
City Engineer and in form with surety and conditions approved by the City
Attorney.  No such letter of credit or check shall be accepted unless it is
enforceable by or payable to the Hopkins County Joint Planning Commission in
a sum at least 105% of the cost of constructing the improvements as estimated
by the design engineer with the approval of the City Engineer and in form
with surety and conditions approved by the City Attorney.  The surety/bond
may be renewed one time for one year.  Prior to surety/bond release, all
required improvements shall be inspected and verified by the City Engineer
and as-builts shall be provided.



      (2)   Reduction in amount. Two reductions in the amount of the
surety will be permitted during the construction period.  Any request for
reduction shall be accompanied by an accurate account of the cost of
improvements for which the reduction is sought and a signed statement by the
City Engineer, after field inspection and verification, that said
improvements have been installed satisfactorily.



      (3)   Warranty. The developer shall provide a one-year period,
from the official acceptance date of the public improvements, as a warranty
period.  During that time the developer will be responsible for the
correction of any defects found.  A minimum of 10% of the original surety
amount shall be maintained throughout the warranty period.  At the time the
warranty period expires and all defects have been corrected, the remainder of
the surety shall be released to the developer.

Findings Necessary for Granting Variances



Before granting variances, the Planning Commission must determine that the
request is without detriment to the public good; does not impair the purposes
and basic objectives of the regulations; is not generally applicable to other
property; does not in any manner vary from provisions of the zoning ordinance
or other adopted regulations; and does not impair the desirable general
development of the neighborhood and community as proposed by the
comprehensive plan.  In the space below, describe the impact the proposed
variance will have on the neighborhood and state the reason for approving
this request.  This explanation should address:



1.   The special circumstances of the proposed use;



2.   Site constraints that would make the strict adherence to the
requirements infeasible; and,



3.   Whether the variance would supplement the purpose of enhancing the
public welfare.



The Planning Commission may also consider other factors it may deem relevant
in making this decision.



 



 



I (We) do hereby certify that the information provided herein is both
complete and accurate to the best of my (our) knowledge, and I (we)
understand that any inaccuracies may be considered just cause for
invalidation of this application and any action taken on this application. 
I (We) do hereby understand that a variance of any requirement does not
exempt the development from any other requirements of the Zoning Ordinance,
Subdivision Regulations, or other City or State Regulations.

chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other

reasonable use of land, building or structure.

granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and

   (A)   Lapse of non-conforming designation.  Where a structure is
non-conforming or where the use of a structure is non-conforming or where the
land has non-conforming status, such status shall be forfeited under any of
the following circumstances:



      (1)   If the non-conforming land is legally joined under
common ownership with other adjoining land so that the entity is conforming;



      (2)   If a non-conforming use of land ceases for a period of
twelve (12) consecutive months;



      (3)   If a non-conforming structure is made to conform;



      (4)   If a non-conforming use of a structure or a
non-conforming use of a structure and land in combination is discontinued or
abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months.  As used herein, the words
“discontinued/abandoned” means that one (1) owner or responsible party
for the use of the property cannot demonstrate that he or she had clear
intent to continue using the property for the non-conforming purpose and that
he or she had augmented that intent by making every reasonable effort to
continue to have the property so used.  Intent can be demonstrated by
providing documentation or evidence that:



         (a)   The owner has made reasonable continuous effort to
have the property rented or sold for the non-conforming purpose;



         (b)   The property has been vacant as a result of legal
proceedings; or



         (c)   The owner, by reason of age or infirmity, was
unable to manage or cope with the responsibility of a tenant; or



      (5)   The non-conforming use is changed to a conforming use no
matter how short the period of time.



   (B)   Non-conforming lots of record.



      (1)   In any district where a specified use is permitted,
permitted buildings and customary accessory structures may be constructed on
any single lot of record as defined by this chapter, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter.



      (2)   Such lot must be of separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. If two (2) or more
lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in
a single ownership are of record at the time of passage of this chapter and
if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot
width and lot area, the lands involved shall be considered an undivided
parcel for the purpose of this chapter.



   (C)   Intermittent use.  The casual, intermittent, temporary or
illegal use of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the
existence of a non-conforming use and the existence of a non-conforming use
on the part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a
non-conforming use on the entire lot or tract.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.122  ENLARGEMENTS TO NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.



   (A)   Expansion of non-conformity restricted.  Except if
specifically provided for in this chapter, no person may engage in any
activity that causes an increase in the extent of non-conformity in a
non-conforming situation. In particular, it shall be unlawful to:



      (1)   Increase the total amount of space devoted to a
non-conforming use;



Exception: A non-conforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a
completed building that when the use was made non-conforming by this chapter
was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use.



      (2)   Increase non-conformity with respect to density
restrictions, dimensional requirements, such as but not limited to setbacks
and other requirements, such as but not limited to parking.



   (B)   Guidelines for Board of Adjustments.  Pursuant to KRS 100.253
and notwithstanding this subchapter, the Board of Adjustments shall not allow
the enlargement or extension of a non-conforming situation beyond the scope
and area of its operation at the time the regulation which makes its use
non-conforming was adopted, nor shall the Board permit a change from one (1)
non-conforming use to another unless the new non-conforming use is in the
same or a more restrictive classification, except as is permitted herein
below.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.123  NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Alterations.  A non-conforming structure shall not be
enlarged, replaced or structurally altered except in conformance with this
chapter.



   (B)   Accessory structure.  An accessory structure that is closer
to property lines than allowed by this chapter may be added to laterally as
long as the addition comes no closer to a property line than the existing
portion of the structure, does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
existing structure and no new non-conformity is created.



   (C)   Restoration.  Any structure, however, may be restored to a
safe condition if declared unsafe by the enforcement officer or other public
official with jurisdiction, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.124  REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   Minor repairs and routine maintenance of property where
non-conforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged.



   (B)   If a structure is removed or destroyed other than by
intentional means of the owner, the structure may be reconstructed, provided
the owner makes application within six (6) months of the date of removal or
destruction, but the structure shall not be enlarged, extended or moved, so
long as reconstruction does not create new non-conformities with respect to
such matters as but not limited to setback and parking requirements.

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING



§ 156.140  INTENT AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Intent.  The intent of this subchapter is to:



      (1)   Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas and
property abutting public rights-of-way;



      (2)   Require buffering between incompatible uses;



      (3)   Protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal,
character and value of the surrounding neighborhoods; and



      (4)   Promote public health and safety through the reduction
of artificial light glare, heat, noise and visual pollution.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   No new site development, building, structure or
off-street parking area shall hereafter be constructed unless landscaping is
provided as required by the provisions of this subchapter.



      (2)   No building, structure or off-street parking area shall
be expanded, moved, removed and/or reconstructed unless the minimum
landscaping required by the provision of this subchapter is provided for the
property to the extent of its alteration or expansion, but not for the entire
property.



      (3)   This subchapter shall not apply to single-family
residential use.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.141  OFF-STREET PARKING.



   All off-street parking areas of three (3) or more spaces shall be
landscaped in accordance with the following requirements:



      (A)   Perimeter landscaping: Parking lots of three (3) or more
spaces which abut a street right-of-way shall be required to maintain a three
(3) foot wide strip of landscaped area.



      (B)   Internal landscaping: A minimum of three percent (3%) of
the total parking area shall be landscaped in parking lots having twenty (20)
or more spaces. The landscaped areas shall be dispersed throughout the
parking lot with ends of aisles and corners landscaped. One (1) tree per
every two hundred (200) square feet of landscaped area shall be provided.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.142  LANDSCAPE AND LAND USE BUFFERS.



   Landscaping shall be required as a buffer between non-compatible land
uses with common property boundaries. Landscape buffer areas shall be
designed, provided and maintained according to the following:



      (A)   A permanent landscape buffer of evergreen plant material
or other suitable buffer as approved by the Administrative Official is
required where a non-compatible use abuts a residential use.



      (B)   Trees which are intended to provide screening to
separate non-compatible uses shall not be planted further than ten (10) feet
apart; parking and loading facilities which are located adjacent to
residential areas shall be additionally screened to a minimum height of three
(3) feet (via on earth berm, depressed parking, solid fence, etc.) to reduce
automobile headlight glare onto adjacent property.



      (C)   Where vegetative or topographic conditions that provide
a natural screening and buffer exist prior to development of properties in
question and meet or exceed the minimum requirements, every effort shall be
made to retain such conditions. In such cases additional screening may not be
required, provided that provision is made for maintenance of such condition
to the satisfaction of the Administrative Official.



      (D)   All landscaping shall utilize living plant materials
(not artificial) and shall be planted in-ground (not in above-ground
planters) and shall be suitable to the western Kentucky area and specific
conditions of the site in question.



      (E)   The owner of the property shall be responsible for
maintaining, repairing and replacing all required plant material and ensuring
that they remain in good health and are kept free from refuse and debris. Any
dead, unhealthy or missing plants shall be replaced by the next planting
season or within one (1) year, whichever comes first. All landscape planting
areas shall be stabilized from soil erosion immediately upon planting and
shall be maintained for the duration of the premises. In the event that plant
material is severely damaged due to an unusual weather occurrence or other
Act of God, the owner shall have six (6) months to replant.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.143  TRANSITIONAL SCREENING AND BARRIERS FOR STORAGE AND UTILITY
AREAS.



   All open storage of merchandise, material, automobiles, trucks and
equipment shall be screened (approved by the Administrative Official) by
either a wall, fencing or evergreen planting at the side and rear of the lot
abutting a residential use on which said storage occurs; the height of which
shall be adequate to obstruct the visibility of such materials from the
abutting residential use. In all zoning districts, dumpsters are required to
be screened.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.144  LANDSCAPING AT DRIVEWAYS AND STREET INTERSECTIONS.



   (A)   To ensure that landscape materials do not constitute a driving
hazard, a sight triangle shall be observed at all street intersections or
intersection of driveways or alleys with streets or railroad crossings.



   (B)   The site triangle shall consist of the area measured within
the radius of twenty (20) feet from the point where the curb line of any
street, driveway or alley intersects the curb line of another street,
driveway or alley. Within this sight triangle, no landscape material nor
other fixed object shall obstruct vision between a height of three (3) feet
and a height of ten (10) feet above the average elevation of the existing
surfaces at the center line of each street, driveway or alley.



(Ord. 2003-06, passed 3-3-03)



§ 156.145  WAIVING SCREENING AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a
development site or the location or size of the parcel to be developed would
make strict adherence to the requirements of this chapter serve no meaningful
purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the
required screen and buffer, the Administrative Official may alter the
requirements provided the spirit and intent is maintained.



   (B)   Such an alteration may occur only at the written request of
the owner/developer, who shall submit a plan to the Administrative Official
showing existing site features that would screen the proposed use and any
additional screening materials the owner/developer may propose to have
installed.



   (C)   The Administrative Official shall have no authority to alter
the screening and buffer requirements unless the subdivider/developer
demonstrates that existing site features and any additional screening
materials will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required screen.

PARKING REGULATIONS



§ 156.160  GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.



   (A)   Any off-street parking area, other than those for residential
uses, shall be designed so that vehicles may exit such areas without backing
onto a public street.



   (B)   Off-street parking areas of all developments shall be designed
so that sanitation, emergency and other public service vehicles can serve
such developments.



   (C)   Every off-street parking area shall be designed so that
vehicles do not extend onto public rights-of-way, sidewalks or tend to bump
against or damage any wall, vegetation or other obstruction.



   (D)   The minimum standard for off-street parking areas shall be
paved with asphalt or concrete with a compacted crushed stone base. Subject
to prior approval of the application and design, alternative designs and
materials which are incorporated into the overall stormwater abatement and
treatment system will be allowed. Such systems may be used if constructed
over an approved drainage collection system. The collection system and basin
shall be designed and constructed to meet all city, state and federal
regulations and be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the State
of Kentucky. Examples of such alternative parking surfaces include: pervious
concrete and contained and supported gravel, paver and grass infiltration
systems. Similar surfaces may be incorporated in associated project walkways.



   (E)   Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can
proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians and without interfering
with parking areas.



   (F)   No off-street parking area shall be located over an active or
auxiliary septic tank field.

in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created
contain within them the rectangular area required by this subchapter.



   (C)   Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for
parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less
than twenty-two (22) feet by twelve (12) feet.

§ 156.184  MANUFACTURED HOUSING PARK (MHP) REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Purpose.  The intent of a manufactured housing park is to
provide an area for the placement of manufactured/mobile homes. Because of
their unusual characteristics, manufactured housing parks pose special
problems in the application of land use control techniques and require
special consideration as to their proper location and character in relation
to adjacent uses and to the circumstances and conditions under which each
such use may be permitted. The standards contained in this section represent
an attempt to provide adequate protection for, and consideration of, both the
community and the manufactured/mobile home dweller.



   (B)   Application.  Application for a manufactured housing park
shall be made to the Administrative Official and shall meet all of the major
development plan requirements. Content of the plan shall be as stated in §
156.075 (Major Development Plan) plus dimensions, location and number of all
lots and a large-scale plan for one (1) typical manufactured/mobile home
showing home location, parking spaces, walks, accessory structures and any
other items requested by the Administrative Official.



   (C)   Minimum design standards.  All manufactured housing parks
shall conform with the following standards for development:



      (1)   Manufactured/mobile homes are not permitted on lots
outside of an approved manufactured housing park unless specifically
permitted by other provisions of this chapter.



      (2)   The developer may be permitted to develop a MHP in
stages as long as he or she complies with the overall approved plan for the
entire tract and initially has a minimum of ten (10) lots developed for use.



      (3)   No more than one (1) manufactured/mobile home, with its
accessory structures, shall be permitted on a single lot.



      (4)   A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be
provided for each manufactured/mobile home.



      (5)   The home pad shall be improved to provide adequate
support for the placement and tie-down of the manufactured/mobile home.



   (D)   Landscape buffers.  Manufactured housing parks shall meet all
applicable requirements of landscaping and screening set forth in §§
156.140 et seq. of this chapter.



   (E)   Accessory uses.  Accessory uses and structures which are
customarily accessory and clearly incidental to a MHP, such as those listed
below, are allowed. Accessory uses shall be for the convenience of the
occupants of the park and shall present no visible evidence of a commercial
character that would attract customers other than the occupants of the park.



      (1)   Any community facility buildings shall be permitted one
(1) wall sign per building not to exceed four (4) square feet in area.



      (2)   All common areas for recreational, management or service
facilities shall be of adequate area and configuration to accommodate
contemplated structures and uses and shall be conveniently located to all MHP
residents.



      (3)   The following uses are considered accessory to a MHP:



         (a)   Management headquarters;



         (b)   Recreational facilities;



         (c)   Postal area;



         (d)   Community building;



         (e)   Laundry facilities;



         (f)   Tennis courts; and



         (g)   Other uses and structures customarily incidental
to the operation of a manufactured housing park.

   (C)   Unless a majority of the entire City Council votes to override
the Planning Commission’s recommendation, such recommendation shall become
final and effective and if a recommendation of approval was made by the
Planning Commission, the ordinance of the City Council adopting the zoning
map amendment shall be deemed to have passed by operation of law.

§ 157.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Ch. 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safely, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain
management chapter.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and
by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding
by provisions designed to:

chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.



   A ZONE.  Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the
principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year
flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).  A structure located on
the same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principle structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human
habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential.
Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage
sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.

to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
ordinances, and open space plans.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.  This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.

combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.



   FLOODPROOFING.  Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation

of water and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and
anticipated debris impact forces.

to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be
applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level,
but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the
structure, such as building utilities. HVAC components, and the like.



   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related in §§ 157.45 et seq., means that
the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners
of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it
is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high
flood insurance rates.



   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.  A facility, structure, or other
development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a
docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or
passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The
term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service

   HAZARD POTENTIAL.  The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam
or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential
classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of
a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity,
flood routing capacity).



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.



   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

certified either:



         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the
Secretary of the Interior; or



         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in
states without approved programs.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).



      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the
payment of a claim for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain
management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a
building covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains
a loss and the state or community declares the building to be substantially
or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to
elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.



      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and
non-residential buildings (this category includes public or government
buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under
the NFIP.

similar bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation
or improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other
obstruction (except those constructed by the Department of Highways) across
or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and
specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political
subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement
and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the
cabinet and a permit issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt
those dams, embankments or other obstructions, which are not of such size or
type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or
retention of water supply.



      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision
of the state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any
other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a
building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to
a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling,
raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the
channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for
such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit
issued as required in division (1) above.



      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet
any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction,
improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district,
ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval
of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is
determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial
use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision
in control thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through
KRS Chapter 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151
concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges,
fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of
any stream which structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface
coal mining operations.

   MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).  The average height of the sea for all stages of
the tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL
is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the
floodplain as shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the
term is synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929
or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988.



   MITIGATION.  Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term

commenced on or after the effective date of the city's floodplain management
regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.



   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum,

effective date of the city’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.



   NON-RESIDENTIAL.  Structures that are not designed for human
habitation, including but is not limited to: small business concerns,
churches, schools, farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool
houses, clubhouses, recreational structures, mercantile structures,

floodplain construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the following
information is required.



      (1)   Application stage.



         (a)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level
(MSL) of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in
Zone A and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or



         (b)   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level
to which any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;



         (c)   All appropriate certifications from a registered
professional engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed
structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria in §§ 157.31(B) and
157.33(B);



         (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse
will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.



      (2)   Construction stage.



         (a)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before
construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the State a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level. In
AE, A1-30, AH, and A zones where the community has adopted a regulatory Base
Flood Elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same.

any premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the administrator may
enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect
the same or perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter.



         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he/she
shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such
request entry.



         (c)   If entry is refused, the administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.



         (d)   When the administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request
is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the
administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.



      (7)   Scop work orders.



         (a)   Upon notice from the administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the
person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be
resumed.



      (8)    Revocation of permits.



         (a)   The administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based;



         (b)   The administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the administrator that the construction, erection,

   In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required:



   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including
the effects of buoyancy;



   (B)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.This standard
shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces.



   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;



   (D)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;



   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so
as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding; and if



   (F)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage
paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures;



   (G)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;



   (H)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;



   (I)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding; and



   (J)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a

shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this
chapter;



   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a
structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended,
or replaced.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.31  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in § 157.07, the following provisions are
required:



   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork
elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with standards of division (C).



      (1)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade
to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the
FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no
depth number is specified.



      (2)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated two feet above the base
flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain
Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are
determined. Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no
data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations)
Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical requirements for
a State Floodplain Permit. The applicant shall provide cross sections for
determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any
proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross
sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error
tolerances of no more than 0.5 foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken
at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points
where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross
section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the
number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure
that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require
additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond
those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.



      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base
flood elevation.



      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of
the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:



      (1)   Be flood proofed below an elevation two feet above the
level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;



      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical
equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of
the base flood elevation; or



      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
157.31(A)(1)(c).



      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in §
157.31(D).



      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which
are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials
below an elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA
Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:



         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect; or



         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater.



   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters lo
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.



      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum criteria;



         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding;



         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation
or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and



         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions.



      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and



      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.



      (1)   (a)   All new or substantially improved manufactured
homes placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements
for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:



            1.   On individual lots or parcels;



            2.   In expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions;



            3.   In new manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;



            4.   In substantially improved manufactured home
parks or subdivisions; or



            5.   Outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision;



            6.   In an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred
“substantial damage” as the result of a flood.



         (b)   All manufactured homes must be:



            1.   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and



            2.   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than
two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; and



            3.   Be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.



      (2)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be
elevated so that:



         (a)  The manufactured home is securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement, so that either the:



            1.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation;
or



            2.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent
grade.



      (3)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within
A, A1-30, AO, AH. and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
must either:



         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;



         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or



         (c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction
of this chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for
“manufactured homes”.



      (4)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle regulations,
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.



   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special Hood hazard
established in § 157.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply;



      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge;



      (2)   If this division (E) is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 157.30 et seq.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.32  STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 157.07,
where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where
base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions
apply:



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall
be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.



   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures
shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance
with § 157.07.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.33  STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 157.07,
are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:



   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood
depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent
grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest
adjacent grade.



   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential structures shall:



      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade.
In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent
grade.



      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be completely flood-proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or,
in Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot
so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in § 157.31(B).



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.34  STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.



   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage;



   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;



   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,



   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway
data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.



   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided
to the Floodplain Administrator.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.35  STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH
THE LETTER ‘A’.



   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated
'A' the following provisions shall apply:



   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;



   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;



   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above
grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor
area, at least two openings required on opposite walls;



   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level two feet
above the base flood elevation;



   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;



   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;



   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.36  CRITICAL FACILITIES.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of
the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must
be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released
into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base
flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES



§ 157.45  NATURE OF VARIANCES.



   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this subchapter  are based
on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.



   (B)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and
contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be
properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.46  DESIGNATION AND DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEAL BOARD.



   (A)   The Mayor shall establish an Appeal Board pursuant to §
152.04.



   (B)   Duties of variance and appeals board.



      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.



      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as
provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.47  APPEALS/VARIANCE PROCEDURES.



   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and the:



   (A)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.



   (B)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;



   (C)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner
and future owners of the property;



   (D)   Importance to the community of die services provided by the
proposed facility;



   (E)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the
case of functionally dependent facility;



   (F)    Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;



   (G)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



   (H)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;



   (I)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



   (J)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and



   (K)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and
bridges.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.48  CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.



   Upon consideration of the factors listed above; and the purposes of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.



   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.



   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of
deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of
variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not
grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever
elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City
Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the
local ordinance.



   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the
flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination
shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and
not destroy the historic character and design of the structure.



   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



      (1)    A showing of good and sufficient cause;



      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this chapter);
and



      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition
section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization
of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.



   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and
the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request.



   (G)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of

§ 157.49  VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.



   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:



   (A)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.



   (B)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks
to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County Clerk and shall be
recorded, in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.



   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

§ 157.50  HISTORIC STRUCTURES.



   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.51  NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE FLOODWAY.



   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.



(Ord. 2008-03, passed 4-21-08)



§ 157.99  PENALTY.



   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions,
shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense. Any person violating any
provision of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty or fine of not
more than $250 for a first offense and an additional $500 for each subsequent
offense, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the
case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain Administrator
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.

§ 158.11  COMPUTATIONS.



   The following principles shall control the computations of sign area
and sign height:



   (A)   Computation of Area of Individual Signs.  The area of a sign
face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one
face), shall be calculated using the area contained within a single
continuous perimeter enclosing all parts of such sign but excluding any
structural elements outside the limits of the sign which are required for the

Click here to view Figure 1



   (B)   Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs.  The sign area for
a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area
of all sign faces visible from any one point.  See Figure 2.  When two
identical sign faces are placed back-to-back or in a V-shape so that both
faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when such sign
faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two
(42) inches apart or greater than a forty-five (45) degree angle, the sign
area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.  See Figure
3.  The sum of all sign faces shall not exceed twice the maximum sign area
as set forth in this chapter.

Click here to view Figure 4



   (C)   Computation of Height.  The height of a sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade, or to the
elevation of an adjacent public road, to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or
excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.  See Figure 4.



   (D)   Computation of free standing sign setback.  The required
setback for free standing signs shall be the distance between the sign’s
leading edge and the property line.

§ 158.23  SIGN VARIANCE.



   (A)   Definition. A sign variance is a mechanism, which allows an
individual to install a sign on his or her property in a way that is
otherwise prohibited by the City’s Sign Regulations. Typically, a sign
variance is sought by an individual wishing to waive one or more dimensional
standards/general requirements such as size and height limitations, placement
in reference to the building and/or street, or type of sign allowed in a
particular zoning district due to unique signs or unusual conditions.



   (B)   Purpose. Due to the strict nature of the Sign Regulations
regulating signs in agricultural, conservation, residential, neighborhood
commercial and office professional zoning districts and allowing a maximum
size sign of 50 square feet or less, there may be instances where the
requirements of the Sign Regulations would result in a significant hardship
or would not permit the owner to effectively advertise its business or
service. By applying to the Board of Adjustment (BOA) for a sign variance, a
relief mechanism is provided to grant exceptions to the Sign Regulations.
However, in no instance may the BOA grant a variance to allow a sign to
exceed 50% of the maximum area and height allowed in a particular zone.



   (C)   Review Criteria. In assessing the appropriateness of a sign
variance application, the BOA shall take into consideration the benefit to
the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against any resulting
detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood. In so doing,
the following findings must be found:



      (1)   The variance is in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of the Madisonville Sign Regulations;



      (2)   The applicant has established a hardship is created by
exceptional or extraordinary conditions applying to the property that do not
apply generally to adjacent and/or nearby properties and such conditions are
a result of lot size or shape or topography over which the applicant or owner
has no control. A mere loss of an advantage, convenience to the applicant or
economic reasons alone do not constitute a hardship;



      (3)   The variance will not adversely impact the visual image
of the area, will not be detrimental or offensive to reasonable property
owners in the vicinity, or adversely impact or be inconsistent or
incompatible with the character of the adjoining properties and/or
neighborhoods;



      (4)   The variance will not adversely affect pedestrian and/or
vehicular traffic or safety.



   (D)   Application Procedure.



      (1)   An application for a sign variance, including supporting
materials and a site plan, must be submitted to the Madisonville Zoning
Administrator who will then schedule a public hearing before the BOA to
consider the request. At least 7 days prior to the public hearing, a legal
notice shall be placed in the local newspaper, and the adjoining property
owners shall be notified by regular mail of the public hearing.



      (2)   In deciding on the sign variance request, the BOA may
approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the variance. In addition,
the BOA may impose such other terms and conditions as it deems necessary to
minimize any adverse impact on the neighborhood or community.



      (3)   The applicant, or a representative of the applicant, is
strongly encouraged to attend the hearing in order to address concerns and to
respond to any questions raised by the BOA.



   (E)   Materials to be Submitted.



      (1)   A completed sign variance application;



      (2)   A site plan showing the following:



         (a)   Location of all existing and proposed signs on the
lot or building, (building signs include awning, projecting, roof, suspended
and window signs);



         (b)   Location of all existing buildings,
driveways/access roads, parking areas and adjoining street right-of-way;



         (c)   Setback distances from the proposed signs to the
property lines and to any existing buildings and/or signs on the lot.



      (3)   Dimensions of all existing and proposed signs including
ground clearance and overall height from grade to bottom of sign. Attach
photographs or sign renderings of proposed signs. Building wall size must be
provided if proposed sign is to be located on the building;



      (4)   Provide a copy of the deed of the property in question
and any site surveys or plats; and



      (5)   Application fee.

§ 158.24  MAINTENANCE.



   All signs shall be properly maintained.  Such maintenance shall
include proper alignment of structure, continued readability of the structure
and preservation of the structure with paint or other preservatives.  If a
sign is not maintained, written notice of any disrepair may be issued by the
enforcement officer to the owner of said structure or property owner.  If
the disrepair is not corrected within sixty (60) days of issuance of said
notice, the Administrator may cause removal of the structure.

§ 158.25  ABANDONED/OBSOLETE SIGNS.



   (A)   Abandoned signs shall be removed within thirty (30) days of
abandonment.  This section shall not apply to any sign associated with a
vacant business or property which is advertised and marketed for sale or
lease provided that the sign and the property is maintained in conformance
with all applicable provisions as established by the city.



   (B)   Upon failure of sign owner or lessee, or property owner, to
comply with this chapter, the Administrator shall issue a written notice to
the owner.  The notice shall state that the sign shall be removed within
thirty (30) days.  If the owner fails to comply with the written notice to
remove the sign, the Administrator is hereby authorized to cause removal of
the sign. Any expense incidental to the removal of the sign, including
reasonable attorney fees, shall be charged to the owner of the property upon
which the sign is located and shall constitute a lien upon the property. 
For the purpose of dealing with abandoned signs in this chapter, the word
“remove” shall mean:



      (1)   The sign face, along with posts, columns, or supports of
free-standing signs, shall be taken down and removed from the property.



      (2)   The sign face and supporting structures of
“projection”, “roof” or “wall” signs shall be taken down and
removed from the property.



      (3)   The sign face of “painted wall signs” shall be
removed by painting over the wall sign in such a manner as to completely
cover up and hide from sight the sign in question.

Within sixty (60) days of the receipt of a nomination from a private

individual landmarks, and the City Council may make these designations by the
enactment of ordinances. In addition, a property owner, any resident of
Madisonville or any organization may ask the Commission to study a property

of all adjoining property. Written notice shall be considered sufficient when
it is mailed to the person listed on the tax rolls of the city.



   (C)   Standards. Before its first public hearing on a designation,
the Commission shall adopt general standards that will apply to historic
districts and landmarks or property and will assist owners in the
preservation and rehabilitation of their property. The standards shall be

the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines
for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may include other guidelines that
will apply to all designated property to the city.

indigenous materials.



   (E)   Report to the City Council. After evaluating the testimony at
its public hearing, survey information and other material it has assembled,
the Commission shall make its recommendation to the City Council with a

Ordinance or Subdivision Regulations, the higher standard shall govern.



   (H)   Notification of designation. The Commission shall notify each

§ 159.06  APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS AND PROPERTY IN HISTORIC
DISTRICTS.



   (A)   Requirement for certificate of appropriateness. A certificate
of appropriateness from the Commission shall be required before a person may
undertake the following actions affecting a landmark or a property in a
historic district:



      (1)   Any alteration of the exterior part of a building or
structure that is easily visible to the public;



      (2)   New construction or addition; or



      (3)   Demolition or relocation.



   (B)   Application to the Commission. A person shall be referred to
the Commission by the Building Inspector when he/she wants to undertake an
exterior alteration visible to the public, new construction, or demolition
affecting a landmark or a property in a historic district. The person shall
supply the Commission with the information it requests in order to reach a
decision on his application for a certificate of appropriateness. The
applicant shall provide, where applicable, drawings of the proposed work,
photographs of the existing building or site and adjacent properties, and
information about the building materials to be used.



   (C)   Stop work order; injunction. In the event work is being
performed without the required Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission
shall direct the Building Inspector to issue a stop work order. All work
shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be
undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The
Commission shall meet with the owner or his agent to resolve the problem.



   (D)   Action by the Commission or architectural review; notice. For
new construction, major structural changes and demolition requests, the
Commission shall hold a public hearing on each Certificate of Appropriateness
request within forty-five (45) days after a completed application is received
by the Commission. All other CPA requests (with the exception of requests for
signs which may be approved by staff) shall require a public meeting within
30 days a completed application is received. The Commission shall approve or
disapprove each application, and it shall give its reasons for its decision
using the criteria contained in this section and in its standards. The
Commission may suggest modifications to an application and where agreed upon
by the owner or his agent may then approve a Certificate of Appropriateness
providing for revisions in the plans submitted. Applicants shall be given
notice of the public hearings and meetings relating to their application and
shall be informed of the Commission's decision. When an application has been
approved, the applicant shall be given a Certificate of Appropriateness.
Advertised notice of the public hearing shall be given in accordance with
Chapter 424 of the Kentucky Revised Statues.



   (E)   Criteria in deciding on applications. In making a decision on
an application, the Commission shall use its standards. The Commission shall
consider:



      (1)   The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the
property in the historic district upon which such work is to be done; and



      (2)   The relationship between such work and other adjacent or
nearby buildings and property. In evaluating the effect and the relationship,
the Commission shall consider historical and architectural significance,
architectural style, design, texture, materials and color. The certificate
from the Commission shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the
requirements of other state and local laws and regulations.



   (F)   Routine alterations; ordinary maintenance and repairs. The
Commission may prepare a list of routine alterations that may receive
immediate approval from staff without a public hearing when an applicant
complies with the written standards of the Commission. The Commission shall
not regulate the color of paint used on designated property, but it may
prepare and distribute material on paint colors appropriate for different
types and styles of buildings. Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be
undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness. Every person in charge
of a landmark or a property in a historic district shall keep it in good
repair. No provision in this chapter shall be interpreted to require an owner
or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his or her building to its
original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to
the provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring buildings and
structures to be kept in good repair.



   (G)   Meetings with owners about condition of buildings. The
Commission shall request a meeting with a property owner when his or her
landmark or his or her building in a historic district is in poor repair, and
the Commission shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of
his or her property. After this step, the Commission may request the Building
Inspector to take action to require correction of defects in any building or
structure designated under this chapter so that such building or structure
shall be preserved in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.



   (H)   Emergency situations. In any case where the Building Inspector
determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or
property affecting a landmark or a property in a historic district, he may
order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the
Commission. The city shall notify the Commission of the action taken after
the completion of the work.



   (I)   Demolition of a landmark or a building or structure in a
historic district. When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a
building or structure in a historic district, the Commission shall negotiate
with the applicant to see if an alternative to demolition can be found.



   (J)   Length of validity of certificate of appropriateness. A
certificate of appropriateness shall remain valid for one (1) year after it
is issued. Work is required to start before the end of the one-year period.
If actual work is not commenced within one year, the certificate shall
expire. Actual work is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.



   (K)   Appeal of the Commission's decision. Any party aggrieved by a
decision of the Madisonville Historic District has the right to appeal the
Commission's decision to the Madisonville City Council within thirty (30)
days of the official decision of the Commission.

§ 159.07  CONFORMITY WITH THE CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the Building Inspector and the Commission to inspect any work being
performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being performed
which is not in accordance with such certificate, the Commission shall direct
the Building Inspector to issue a stop work order. All work shall cease on
the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as
such stop work order shall continue in effect. The Commission shall meet with
the owner or tenant to resolve the problem.

§ 160.02  INTRODUCTION.



   (A)   In compliance with our National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Phase
II program, the city has created this chapter to provide a comprehensive
stormwater management program.  The requirements herein are applicable to
all stormwater infrastructure owned or regulated by the city.



   (B)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing
water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species.  Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers, ditches
and the dredging of lakes.  In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial
and aquatic habitat.

downstream area, the City Engineer or his or her designee may issue
correction notice(s) and stop work order(s) and assign fines.  Informal
settlement of matters under this section is encouraged.



   (B)   Issuance of notice of violation or citation.



      (1)   Enforcement proceedings for this section shall be
initiated by the issuance of a notice of violation or a citation by the City
Engineer or his or her designee.  In lieu of a citation, the City Engineer
may give the violator a notice that a violation has occurred and allow the
violator a specified period of time to remedy the violation without a fine. 
The time allowed by the City Engineer shall depend on the nature of the
violation and the time necessary to remedy the violation.  If the violator
fails or refuses to remedy the violation within the time specified, the City
Engineer is authorized to issue a citation.



      (2)   The notice of violation or citation shall be delivered
to the violator at his or her last known address as it appears from the
current tax assessment roll or on the application submitted to the City
Engineer’s Office.  Such notice of violation or citation shall be deemed
to be properly served if given by certified mail, return receipt requested,
by personal delivery, or by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place
of residence with any individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years
of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the notice.  Service
by certified mail shall be presumed to have been served on the third day
following mailing.  A copy shall also be posted in a conspicuous place in or
about the structure or premises affected by such notice of violation or
citation.



   (C)   The citation issued by the City Engineer should contain the
following information:



      (1)   A description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;



      (2)   The name and address of the person to whom the citation
is issued;



      (3)   The date and time the violation was observed and the
date and time of issuance of the citation;

the civil fine or to contest the citation;



      (8)   The proposed fine to be imposed per day for the
violation; and



      (9)   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil
fine set forth in the citation or to contest the citation within the time
allowed, the person shall be deemed as having waived the right to a hearing
before the Local Appeals Board and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be final.



   (D)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from
correcting the violation through self help or taking immediate action to
remedy a violation of its ordinances when there is reason to believe that the
violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare,
or if in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation will
be irreparable or irreversible.  The city may file a lien on the property to
recover the city’s costs of labor and material, civil fines and other
expenses including reasonable attorney fees.



   (E)   After issuing a citation, the City Engineer shall deliver a
copy of the citation to the person designated by the Local Appeals Board. 
Upon receipt of a citation, the violator shall respond to the citation within
seven (7) days by either paying the civil fine, or requesting in writing a
hearing before the Local Appeals Board to contest the citation.  If the
violator responds by paying the civil fine, the violator shall still be
required to remedy the violation.  If the violator fails to remedy the
violation or to request a hearing within the designated time, the City
Engineer is authorized to issue another citation and to remedy the
violation.  After determining that compliance has been achieved in the
allowed correction time, the City Engineer shall report that to the Local
Appeals Board.



   (F)   If the violator does not request a hearing before the Local
Appeals Board and the property is not brought into compliance, or if the
Local Appeals Board orders the property be brought into compliance and the
violator refuses, the city and its authorized agents or employees shall have
the right to enter upon the property with such manpower, machinery and
equipment necessary to remedy the situation and to abate the violation.



   (G)   The city shall have a lien on property owned by the person
found by a final, non-appealable order of the Local Appeals Board or by a
final judgment of the court to have committed a violation of a city ordinance
for all fines assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees
incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the ordinance
including reasonable attorney fees.  The lien shall be recorded in the
office of the County Clerk and shall be notice to all persons from the time
of its recording and shall bear interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum
thereafter until paid.



   The lien shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens except
state, county, school boards and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial
proceedings.  In addition to the remedy prescribed above, the person found
to have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the
amount of all fines assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees
incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of this chapter. 
The city may bring a civil action against the person and shall have the same
remedies as provided for the recovery of a debt.



   (H)   Civil penalties.  Any person violating any provision of this
chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty or fine of not more than two
hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for a first offense and an additional
five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each subsequent offense.  Each day’s
violation shall constitute a separate offense.
