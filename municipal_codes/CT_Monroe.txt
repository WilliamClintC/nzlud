ARTICLE I
False Alarms
[Adopted 12-13-201036]
§ 206-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to reduce excessive false alarms, which
burden the Monroe Police Department's limited law enforcement resources
by emphasizing to both alarm users and alarm companies the need to
properly use and maintain the operational effectiveness of alarm systems.
This article establishes reasonable expectations of alarm users to ensure
responsibility for the use of their alarm systems.
§ 206-2. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
ALARM ADMINISTRATOR  The Chief of Police or his designee, who shall
administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer
the provisions of this article.
ALARM COMPANY  A person or a company engaged in selling, leasing,
installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems.
ALARM PERMIT  A permit issued by the Chief of Police allowing the
operation of an alarm system within the Town of Monroe.
ALARM SIGNAL  A detectable signal, audible or visual, generated by
an alarm system, to which the Monroe Police Department is requested to
respond.
ALARM SYSTEM  Any single device or assembly of equipment designed
to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity
requiring immediate attention, and to which law enforcement is requested
to respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire alarms,
domestic violence alarms or alarms designed to elicit a medical response.
ALARM USER  Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
governmental or education entity or any other entity owning, leasing or
operating an alarm system or on whose premises an alarm system is
maintained for the protection of such premises.
ALARM USER AWARENESS CLASS  A class conducted for the purpose
of educating alarm users about the responsible use, operation and
maintenance of alarm systems and the problems created by false alarms.
CANCELLATION  The process where response is terminated when the
alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the Monroe Police
Department that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring
police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior
36.Editor's Note: This ordinance provided an effective date of 1-17-2011.
§ 206-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 206-2
1:57
to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of
civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed.
FALSE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system through mechanical
or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence
of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to
summon law enforcement personnel, unless law enforcement response was
cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before law enforcement
personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meanings
of this article when, upon inspection by the Monroe Police Department,
evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery or other such crime
was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have
activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be
determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions
of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not
reasonably subject to control by the alarm user.
LOCAL ALARM  An alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site that
is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is not monitored
by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an alarm company or
user.
PERMIT YEAR  A twelve-month period beginning on the day and month
on which an alarm permit is issued.
RUNAWAY ALARM  An alarm system that produces repeated alarm
signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The
Monroe Police Department may, in its discretion, discontinue police
responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm.
SIA CONTROL PANEL STANDARD CP-01  The American National
Standard Institute (ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA)
CP-01 Control Panel Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that
details recommended design features for security system control panels
and their associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms.
Control panels built and tested to this standard by a nationally recognized
testing organization will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in
accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm
Reduction."
TOWN  The Town of Monroe or its agent.
VERIFY  An attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative,
to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other
electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to
attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting
law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm
dispatch request. For the purpose of this article, telephone verification shall
require, as a minimum, that a second call be made to a different number,
if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify
himself or herself to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid
before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

The Town officially recognizes the importance of farming to its rural
quality of life, heritage, public health, scenic vistas, tax base, open space,
wetlands and wildlife, and local economy. This right to farm article

encourage the maintenance and improvement of agricultural land for
the production of food and other agricultural products, for its natural
and ecological value and for the activities associated with agriculture.
It is hereby further determined that whatever impact may be caused to
others through generally accepted agricultural practices, such impact is
offset and ameliorated by the benefits of farming to the neighborhood,
community and society in general.

The terms "agriculture" and "farming" shall have all those meanings set
forth in § l-l(q) of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.

in a manner consistent with accepted agricultural practices, which is
engaged in the act of farming as defined in this article shall become
or be considered a nuisance solely because such activity resulted or
results in any changed condition of the use of adjacent land. Agricultural
operations may occur any day or night, provided such activities do
not violate applicable health, safety, fire, zoning, wetlands, life safety,
environmental or building codes and regulations and shall include,
without limitation:
(1) The incidental noise from livestock or farm equipment used in
generally acceptable farming practices;
(2) Odors from livestock, manure, fertilizer or feed;

B. These provisions shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the
negligent or improper operation of any such agricultural operation.
C. Inspection and approval of the agricultural or farming operation, place,
establishment or facility by the Commission of Agriculture or his/her
designee shall be prima facie evidence that such operations follow
generally accepted agricultural practices. Nothing contained in this
article shall restrict the powers of the Monroe Inland Wetlands
Commission, Planning and Zoning Commission or Building or Health
Departments under Connecticut General Statutes.

reason of: appearance; odor; decomposition; adulteration; contamination
by exposure to fire, water, smoke or heat; lack of proper temperature
maintenance; animal or insect contact; or exposure to non-food

C. When a routine food service inspection is found to be in noncompliance
with this code the holder of the license or the person in charge may
request an inspection by appointment in advance of the reinspection due
date. During this appointment, the Director of Health will work with
the holder of the license at the food service establishment to develop a
plan to correct the violations from the failed inspection as well as verify
that corrections already made are satisfactory. Although not required,
the owner/operator of any food service establishment is encouraged to
indicate in writing how conditions that constitute violations have been
addressed. Once verified, this documentation will be included in the food
service establishment's file. Establishments with ongoing violations and
a history of continuous failed routine inspections may be required by
the Director of Health to participate in the food service establishment
improvement program.

establishment improvement plan will receive from the Director of
Health, in writing, notification of such assignment after a hearing. The
Director of Health will schedule a meeting with the owner and/or
manager to develop a list of issues needing improvement. Each plan will
be tailored to the individual food service establishment to achieve long
term compliance. Short-term voluntary closures may be a necessary first
step.
E. The Director of Health and owner/operator will then collaborate on a
schedule for correction. A food service establishment improvement plan
may include, but not be limited to:
(1) Development of an employee training program.
(2) Improvement of food handling practices.

F. Hazard analysis critical control point inspection. The Director of Health
may require a hazard analysis critical control point inspection (HACCP)
for establishments with continuous food handling violations. A HACCP
inspection is designed to identify food safety hazards and determine
the necessary steps that are needed to control the identified hazards.
Following a HACCP inspection, the Director of Health will work with the
owner/operator to develop procedures to reduce risk factors in the food
service establishment.

Modification (as established by the Public Works Department), and

and shall be regarded as additional requirements for all work subject to
this chapter.
§ 308-8. Permit fee.
A. A permit fee shall be determined prior to issuance of permit.
Determination of the specific fee, which will vary contingent on the
extent of the proposed work, will be based on the following categories:
(1) Off pavement: this is for all work within the Town ROW/property that
does not involve direct disturbance of the roadway pavement cross
section but will affect the shoulder area.
(2) One-half roadway width: this is for a typical utility patch anticipated
to be five feet in width for a distance of up to 1/2 the existing
roadway width.
(3) Entire roadway width: same as above, only the entire width of the
existing roadway.
(4) Longitudinal work: this involves all other applications where work is
within the existing roadway, but includes a varied disturbance to the
extent of limits beyond the above-detailed categories.
B. A schedule of permit fees, respective to the above categories, will be
recommended as a fee schedule by the Town Engineer, proposed by the
Director, accepted by the First Selectman and approved by the Town
Council.
C. Established fees for each of the categories are based on an average
patch width required for the installation of one utility/application.
Accordingly, additional utilities within the same trench and/or other
conditions which are anticipated to dictate a wider patch will require
additional and/or separate permits even though the end result may be
one contiguous roadway patch.
D. The permit fee is only refundable upon receipt of written notification
to the Director that work has not been started and has been canceled.
Future work of any kind at the same location will require a new permit
and fee. Said notification shall include the permit number and location.
A processing fee of $30 will be deducted from all reimbursements.
E. Portions of the permit fee will not be refunded in situations where the
final work does not extend to the proposed limits of the issued permit.
F. In situations where work needs to be extended beyond the originally
proposed limits, the applicant/contractor shall notify the Director, in
writing, and pay an additional fee that, when added to the original fee,
will equal the fee required for the newly determined category respective
to anticipated work. No new permits will be issued until the outstanding
permit fee is paid in full.

and maintenance of the same in accordance with this chapter. The Town
or its agent will perform all work to provide a permanent pavement
patch unless a waiver from this requirement (and respective fee) is
granted.
§ 308-9. Enforcement.
A. Any contractor who violates any provision of this chapter or the rules
and regulations issued by the Director shall be liable to the Town for any
expense, loss or damage which may be caused to the Town highway or
property by reason of such violation.
B. The Director may refuse to issue any permits to a contractor who is in
violation of any provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations
issued by the Director until such time as satisfactory compliance is
obtained.
C. All permits expire and are deemed void 30 days after the date of issuance
if the contractor does not perform any work prior to that time. When a
permit becomes void, it is the responsibility of the contractor to reapply
and obtain a new permit before any work is performed.
D. The cancellation of the bond or insurance shall automatically void any
permit which has been issued.
§ 308-10. Waiver of requirements.
A. The following may make a written request to the Director to waive the
performance bond and permit fee (processing fee still applies), provided
that they provide written verification of bonding with the Secretary of
the State, as required per Connecticut General Statutes § 16-230, and
agree to conform to all other requirements of this chapter and/or the
rules and regulations issued by the Director in addition to any conditions
imposed by the Director:

(2) Contractors performing work directly for utility companies (the
utility company must cosign the application).

Zoning Commission (PZC) and/or the Town Inland Wetlands

(5) Individual Town resident, working without any assistance from a
separate entity, through the "Property Owner Waiver Arrangement"
(form available in the Public Works Department). A Property Owner
Waiver Arrangement allows for work to be performed by a resident,
as long as the work does not include the use of labor and/or
equipment not specifically/solely owned, operated and maintained by
said resident (property owner and occupant of the house to which
the location of the work/permit applies). A waiver shall not apply if
the equipment or provided labor is part of a commercial business,
whether owned by the property owner or not.
§ 308-8 MONROE CODE § 308-10
1:106
B. Utility companies are required to maintain temporary patches and,

D. Work performed under the control and supervision of the State of
Connecticut.
E. Minor repairs by respective property owners to curbing, planting areas,
sidewalks, mailboxes, driveways or other small areas within the ROW
but off the roadway pavement.

Provisions of this chapter in effect at the time of issuance of a permit will
remain in force until such time that all outstanding requirements have been
adequately addressed.
§ 308-13. Driveways.
A. The installation of driveways (including driveway aprons) within the
Town ROW requires the posting of a cash deposit of $500 for each
location, in addition to a nonrefundable processing fee of $30. Said cash
deposit shall be in the form of cash or check made payable to the Town
of Monroe.
B. Cash deposits will be reimbursed (with no interest) to the applicant upon
written request once work has been adequately completed.

A. The Town Council shall designate the Planning and Zoning Commission
as the authoritative body in determining a highway or any portion of a
highway as a scenic road.
B. This chapter does not apply to private, state, or federal roads.
§ 430-2. Designation criteria.
A. Prior to designating a highway or a portion thereof as a scenic road,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall first specifically find that the
highway or portion of the highway to be designated is at least 1/2 mile
in length or that the entire length of the highway is less than 1/4 mile
in length and at least one end of the highway abuts a highway already
designated as scenic. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall also
find that at least three of the following criteria are met:
(1) The highway is unpaved;
(2) The highway is bordered by mature trees or stone walls;
(3) The traveled portion of the highway is no more than 20 feet in width;
(4) The highway offers scenic views;
(5) The highway blends naturally into the surrounding terrain; or
(6) The highway parallels or crosses over brooks, streams, lakes, or
ponds.
B. No highway or portion thereof may be designated as a scenic road by
the Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to this chapter unless the
owners of a majority of the lot frontage abutting the highway or portion
thereof agree to the designation of the highway as a scenic road by
filing a written statement of approval with the Town Clerk of the Town
of Monroe, which statement of approval shall meet the requirements of
§ 430-3.
C. No highway or portion of a highway shall be designated as a scenic road
if the abutting property contains intensive commercial development or if
the highway itself has intensive vehicular traffic.
D. No road constructed as part of an approved plan of subdivision on or
after March 23, 1956, may be considered for scenic road designation.
§ 430-3. Procedure for designation.
A. Statement of approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
consider a highway or portion thereof for designation as a scenic road
on its own initiative. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall also
consider such designation upon submission of a petition of electors,
which petition shall have attached to it a statement of approval as
described below. Each page of any such petition shall have attached to
it a copy of the proposed ordinance designating the highway or portion
thereof as a scenic road. No ordinance designating a highway or portion
thereof shall be adopted unless the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall have received a statement of approval that meets each of the
requirements set forth below.
(1) The statement of approval shall be submitted on a form approved by
the Town Clerk and shall contain the following:
(a) The name of the highway to be designated as a scenic road, or a
general description of the portion of such highway sought to be
§ 430-1 MONROE CODE § 430-3
1:154
designated, together with a statement of the approximate total
length of the highway or the portion thereof to be designated;
(b) A description of those characteristics of the road that qualify it
for scenic road status, including but not limited to the criteria set
forth in § 430-2 satisfied by the road;
(c) The signature of the owners of a majority of lot frontage abutting
the highway or portion of the highway in question, stating that
they approve of designating the road or portion thereof as a
scenic road and indicating their address and lot frontage along
the road or portion of the road in question;
(d) The names and addresses of owners of lot frontage abutting
the highway or portion of the highway in question who did
not approve the designation, and as to such owners whom the
circulator of the statement was unable to contact, a statement
that diligent and reasonable efforts were made to contact such
owners; and
(e) The name, address and signature of the circulator of the
statement of approval, who shall be a resident of Monroe,
together with a statement by the circulator that he or she either
knows each individual who signed the statement of approval or
that the signer satisfactorily identified himself to the circulator.
(2) The original of the statement of approval shall be filed with the
Town Clerk, who shall retain one copy, forward one copy to the
Town Assessor, and forward the original to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The Town Assessor shall verify the ownership and total
lot frontages of those signing the statement of approval, verify that
said total lot frontage constitutes a majority of lot frontage abutting
the highway or portion thereof to be designated as a scenic road,
and submit such verification to the Planning and Zoning Commission
within 14 days from the date the Assessor received the statement of
approval from the Town Clerk.
B. Hearing. In order to designate a highway or portion thereof a scenic
road, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall, upon submission of
verification, hold a public hearing regarding the designation of such road
as a scenic road. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by sending
a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail to the owners of lots
fronting the highway or the portion of the highway to be designated as a
scenic road, or any other property owners abutting such road within 500
feet.
C. Decision. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon the
designation within 60 days from the date of public hearing. The Planning
and Zoning Commission shall approve for designation any highway or
portion of highway that it finds meets the criteria of § 430-2 and if
the statement of approval and any petition of electors conform to the
procedural requirements of Subsection A of this section. Within 10 days
after passage, the ordinance designating a highway or portion of a
highway as a scenic road shall be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in the Town, and notice of such passage shall be sent
by certified or registered mail to the owners of lots fronting on that
§ 430-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 430-3
1:155
highway or portion thereof designated as a scenic road and to any other
property owners abutting such road within 500 feet. Such notice shall be
a simple statement that the highway or portion thereof was designated
as a scenic road by ordinance, together with the date of such action.
The grounds for the designation or nondesignation shall be stated in
the records of the Planning and Zoning Commission and, in the case of
designation, shall include in detail the special features that make the
highway so designated scenic.
D. Signage. Each designated scenic road may be identified by the posting
of signs at both ends.
§ 430-4. Rescission of scenic road designation.
The designation of a highway or the portion of the highway as a scenic
road may be rescinded by the Planning and Zoning Commission, using the
same procedures as those used for the designation, and provided that the
owners of a majority of lot frontage abutting the highway or a portion of
the highway concur with such rescission. No designation of a highway or a
portion of a highway as a scenic road may be rescinded, and no petition or
request for such rescission may be filed, for at least three years after the
effective date of the ordinance so designating a highway or portion of the
highway as a scenic road. No designation of a highway or the portion of the
highway as a scenic road may be rescinded unless the highway or portion
thereof meets the criteria set forth in § 430-2A regarding highway length.
§ 430-5. Alterations or improvements.
A. Preservation objective. The Town shall maintain its scenic roads in good
and sufficient repair and in passable condition. Routine maintenance
and the regulation of future alterations and improvements of designated
highways shall be carried out so as to preserve to the highest degree
possible the scenic characteristics of the highway which are indicated in
the records of the Planning and Zoning Commission as the basis for its
designation as a scenic road.
B. Routine road maintenance. Such maintenance shall include removal of
dead and seriously diseased or damaged trees and branches of trees;
trimming of the tree branches that encroach on the traveled portion
of the highway below the height needed to allow school buses and
emergency vehicles to pass; trimming or removal of brush and removal
of boulders or other obstacles that encroach on the traveled portion
of the road; necessary trimming for utility lines; trimming of brush to
enhance and protect scenic views, stone walls, mature trees and other
characteristics of the scenic road set forth in the decision designating
it a scenic road; correction of drainage problems; and graveling,
retreatment, and repair of existing roadway surfaces. Routine road
maintenance shall not require approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, except that the First Selectman shall be notified of
contemplated routine maintenance to a scenic road at least one week
before it is to commence.
C. Natural disasters. In the case of a natural disaster in which a road
becomes impassable or unsafe for public travel and access must be
§ 430-3 MONROE CODE § 430-5
1:156
provided, emergency repairs may be made as needed to restore the
highway or portion of highway to its pre-emergency condition.
D. Alterations or improvements; procedure. As used herein, the term
"alteration or improvement" to a scenic road shall include widening
of the right-of-way or of the traveled portion of the highway, paving
(including but not limited to gravel or chipped asphalt), changes of
grade, straightening, removal of stone walls and removal of mature
trees, and all other improvements except routine maintenance. The
alteration or improvement of a designated scenic road shall be
determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Any proposal for
alteration or improvement, whether by public or private application,
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission, along with a
suitable map showing in detail the proposed alteration or improvement.
If it deems necessary, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require
the applicant to submit engineering or other technical reports
documenting the need for alteration and offering potential alternative
solutions. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the application. Within 35 days after receiving the
application, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make a
determination on the application. In making its determination, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall also consider the opinion of
the Town Engineer or other licensed engineer as may be retained by
the Town to render an opinion on the application. Final action on the
application shall be taken within 45 days of the public hearing.
E. Standards for alteration. No alterations or improvements to a scenic
road or portion thereof (other than routine maintenance) shall be made
unless the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such
alterations are necessary to maintain the road in good and sufficient
repair and in reasonably safe condition for public travel. The Planning
and Zoning Commission shall not grant an application to improve or alter
a scenic road or portion thereof to accommodate a proposed subdivision
or other development of land to which the scenic road would provide
access unless the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that
such alteration will not have a material adverse effect on the scenic
characteristics of the highway which formed the basis for its designation
as a scenic road, or unless the Planning and Zoning Commission, upon
the advice of the Town Attorney, determines that a refusal to permit
such alteration or improvement would result in a violation of Article I,
Section 11, of the Connecticut Constitution. In determining whether to
allow proposed improvements or alterations, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall take into account the specific safety features of the
proposed change, the overall impact of the proposed change on the
scenic road, and the public response to the proposed change. Any
decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission to alter or improve
a scenic road shall reflect the least possible damage to the scenic
character of the highway. If alterations or improvements to a scenic road
are required, then they shall conform to the following requirements:
§ 430-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 430-5
1:157
(1) Speed limits. Scenic values are correlated with lower speeds. The
speed limit established by the Town for a scenic road shall be
clearly posted.
(2) Curves. Scenic values are correlated with the existence of curves,
which allow a constant unfolding of new and changing views.
Curves shall not be eliminated until they are found to be a definite
hazard within the concept of the specific road.
(3) Grades. Hills and valleys are correlated with scenic values. They
shall not be destroyed by cuts and fills unless absolutely essential
for road safety.
(4) Widths. A narrow road is correlated with high scenic beauty.
Designated highways should never be widened unless the amount
of traffic, as determined by a factual study, demands it. For some
rural roads, the amount of traffic that can be handled can be
greatly increased by wide bypasses and turnouts constructed at
intervals where they do least damage to scenic and other values;
such bypasses and turnouts shall be implemented wherever
possible.
(5) Side slopes. Existing steepness of side slope is preferable to
reduction of gradient by extensive removal of soil and rock. This is
especially true where the slope is fully stabilized and where it is
rich with existing ground cover, shrubs and trees.
(6) Vistas. Vistas of different landscapes shall be preserved by suitable
vegetation management techniques.
(7) Utility lines. Where such lines are overhead, the utility corporations
shall cooperate by suitable vegetation management techniques
which preserve the wildflowers and the shrubs.
(8) Vegetation. Vegetation on the side of the road shall be managed
in such a way as to preserve wildflowers, permissible shrubs of
ornamental and wildlife values, and trees. Overarching isolated
trees, and the canopy of a closed forest, can have extremely high

the purchaser, his heirs, successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall pay

(4) In the event that an application for tax deferral is approved in
accordance with this article, the Tax Assessor shall inform the Tax
Collector in writing as to such approval and the amount of the

foreclosure if the taxpayer is delinquent on that portion of the tax
that has not been deferred.

List of October 1, 2016, and for taxes otherwise payable during
the fiscal year starting July 1, 2017, the deferred amount shall be
subject to an interest equal to 3% per annum, accrued monthly and
compounded annually until fully paid as set forth in this article. For
taxes deferred in all subsequent years, the Board of Finance shall

rate for the following fiscal year.
(7) The Tax Collector shall cause the principal amount of such tax
deferral benefit, excluding interest, to be recorded on July 1 in the
land records of the Town and shall constitute a lien on the property
as provided by Connecticut General Statutes § 12-129n, and payable
as set forth herein. Such lien shall have priority as provided by
Connecticut General Statutes, including but not limited to a priority
in the settlement of such person's estate as set forth or as provided
in § 12-122(f).
(8) The Tax Collector shall keep a record of all liens continued in
accordance with this article so that they may be distinguished from
other liens normally filed under Connecticut General Statutes
§ 12-175. Assignment of any liens established pursuant to this article
shall not be permitted unless granted by resolution of the Monroe
Town Council and the Monroe Board of Finance, as provided under
Connecticut General Statutes § 12-195h.

such time as the real property in question is transferred, assigned,
granted, sold or otherwise conveyed, whether or not for value,
whether in whole or in part, or title is transferred or upon the death
of such taxpayer (unless a spouse qualified under this article hereof
survives), whichever event occurs first. Such payment shall be due,

[Adopted 8-23-2004]
§ 494-1. Authority.
Pursuant to the authority of § 7-137c of the Connecticut General Statutes,
the Town Council hereby adopts an ordinance governing the extension of
existing water mains within the Town of Monroe.
§ 494-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish the procedure for obtaining the
extension of existing water mains requested by the Town of Monroe to areas
of the Town not served by public water, so-called, and for determining and
assessing the cost of such extensions.
§ 494-3. Approval required.
No action shall be taken by the Town of Monroe to obtain the extensions
of a water main at Town expense without the prior approval of the Town
Council, Board of Finance and Town Meeting.
§ 494-4. Cost determination.
Following approval of any water main extension, the Town Council shall
determine the cost of such extension, including but not limited to the cost
of materials, installation, service connections, curb, sidewalk and highway
repairs; the cost of installation of gate valves and shutoffs; any
compensation, fees, charges and expenses of any attorney, engineer,
surveyor, superintendent or inspector employed by the Town; the cost of
any property purchased or acquired as the Town Council shall determine
is required for such extension; the costs of preparing maps, plans, and
specifications; and the cost of printing, publishing or serving
advertisements or notices and interest on bonds or notes issued to cover
such costs, fees, charges and expenses.
§ 494-5. Proportional shares; method of assessment.
Each owner of real property abutting the water main extension shall
reimburse the Town of Monroe his proportionate share of the total cost of
the main extension as determined by the Town Council. The proportionate
share shall be determined by dividing the total cost of the main extension
by the number of lots of real property abutting the main extension, subject
to the provisions of § 494-8 hereinafter set forth. The assessment of the
proportionate share of the cost of the water main extension of any property
owner who elects not to obtain water service from the water main extension
shall be deferred until the sooner of such time as water service for the
property is obtained from the water main extension or as the property is
sold, subject to the provisions of § 494-9 hereinafter set forth.
§ 494-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 494-6
1:225
§ 494-6. Public hearing.
Prior to assessing each property owner with his proportionate share of the
total cost of the water main extension, the Town Council shall conduct a
public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper
having general circulation in the Town of Monroe at least 10 days prior to
the date of such hearing, and a notice of such hearing containing the time,
place and date of such hearing signed by the Monroe Town Clerk shall be
mailed, postage prepaid, to each property owner proposed to be assessed
at his mailing address, as determined from the records of the Monroe Tax
Assessor, at least 10 days prior to the date of such hearing.
§ 494-7. Notice of assessment; certificate of lien.
Following determination of the amount of each assessment to be levied,
the Monroe Tax Collector, at the direction of the Town Council, shall file
on the Monroe Land Records a notice of each assessment in the form of a
certificate of lien describing the property assessed, setting forth the amount
of the assessment and date thereof. The Tax Collector on the date of such
filing shall mail, postage prepaid, a copy of such notice of assessment/
certificate of lien to each property owner assessed at his mailing address
determined from the records of the Monroe Tax Assessor.
§ 494-8. Deferred assessment.
In the case of any land zoned residential or classified pursuant to §§ 12-107a
to 12-107e of the Connecticut General Statutes, inclusive, as farm land,
forest land or open space land on the last-completed Grand List of the Town
of Monroe which exceeds by more than 100% the size of the smallest lot
permitted in the lowest-density residential zone allowed under the Monroe
Zoning Regulations, assessment of such classified or excess land shall
be deferred until such classified or excess land shall be built upon or a
building permit issued therefor or until approval of a subdivision plan of
such classified or excess land by the Monroe Town Planning and Zoning
Commission, whichever event occurs first, at which time the assessment
shall be made. In calculating the proportionate shares provided for in
§ 494-5, the Town Council shall consider any assessments required to be
deferred and shall apportion the undeferred portion of the costs of any main
extension in an equitable manner. In the that event any assessments must
be deferred, the Town Council shall place a caveat on the Monroe Land
Records serving to give notice of such deferred assessment.
§ 494-9. Payment; foreclosure for nonpayment.
Assessments shall be payable in the manner and upon such terms as the
Town Council shall prescribe and may be foreclosed for nonpayment in the
manner provided by law for the foreclosure of tax liens. Assessments shall
be payable in full at the time of a sale of the assessed real property unless
the sale is an exempt transaction pursuant to § 12-498 of the Connecticut
General Statutes.

§ 494-10. Appeal.

Court for the judicial district in which such property is situated pursuant to
the provisions of § 7-137c of the Connecticut General Statutes, as the same
may be amended from time to time.

§1.9 General Regulations 
§1.9.1 Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots 
A. 	Continuance of Nonconforming Structures or Uses 
Any building, structure or use existing at the time of promulgation of these Regulations may be continued even though such building, structure or use does not conform to the provisions of these Regulations. 
B. Abandonment of Nonconforming Structures and Uses 
(1) 	
Removal (not involving normal and reasonable maintenance and repair) of a nonconforming building, structure or portion thereof dimensionally nonconforming shall constitute a discontinuation and abandonment of same. 

(2) 	
A nonconforming use shall not be deemed abandoned solely as a result of nonuse for a specified period of time without regard to the intent of the property owner to maintain that use.  If the owner of said premises desires to resume a presumptively abandoned nonconforming use, an application to the Zoning Enforcement Officer to determine whether or not said nonconforming use was abandoned may be presented.  The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to show that the use was not in fact abandoned. 

(3) 	
Notwithstanding Subsections (1) and (2) above, removal of a building, structure or other developed or operational feature shall constitute a discontinuation and abandonment of a nonconforming use or portion thereof. 

(4) 	
Notwithstanding Subsections (1) and (2) above, the discontinuance of a nonconforming use and replacement thereof by a conforming use, for any period of time, no matter how short, shall constitute abandonment of the nonconforming use.  Such replacement by a conforming use shall occur when the portion of the lot, building or structure formerly devoted to a nonconforming use is used for a conforming use. 


C. Enlargement or Extension of Nonconforming Uses or Structures 
(1) 	
A principal or accessory structure which is conforming in use but does not conform to the height, yard, building coverage, floor area ratio or other dimensional requirements of this chapter shall be deemed to be dimensionally nonconforming. 

(2) 	
No permit shall be issued nor shall any changes be made in such structure that will result in the increase of any such dimensional nonconformity.  Any structure or portion thereof may be altered so as to decrease a dimensional nonconformity or in a manner that will not affect an existing dimensional nonconformity, subject to compliance with any applicable approvals. 

(3) 	
Normal maintenance and repair 

(a) 	
Normal maintenance and repair, including structural repairs of a building or structure with noncomplying bulk is permitted if the same does not increase the degree of or create any new noncomplying bulk in such building or structure. 

(b) 	
Normal maintenance and repair of a building or structure is permitted if it does not extend a nonconforming use. 



(4) 	
No nonconforming building or structure shall hereafter be enlarged, and no nonconforming use of any land, building or other structure shall hereafter be extended to include any land, building or other structure or portion thereof which is not already part of such nonconforming use, except: 

(a) 	
Residential buildings and structures located in residential zones that conformed to the thirty-foot (30) setback requirement in effect on May 18, 1965.  When a building or structure conforming to the aforesaid thirty-foot setback requirement is enlarged, it shall not be enlarged any further forward into the required front yard setback.

A nonconforming use may be extended, as follows, subject to Special Exception Permit approval by the Commission: 

(a) 	
A nonconforming use of an existing principal building or structure may be extended to occupy additional floor area within such existing principal building or structure not formerly used for such nonconforming use provided the portion of the building to be used lawfully existed prior to October 1, 2013. 

(b) 	
A nonconforming non-building use may be extended to use additional land where no substantial operations were previously conducted, provided such extension is on the same lot and said lot existed in its current configuration prior to October 1, 2013, and provided such does not require clearing of trees or alteration of topographic grades greater than two (2) feet in elevation. 

(c) 	
Permitted extension of a nonconforming use shall also be deemed to include necessitated changes in the size and layout of parking areas, access drives, changes in exterior lighting, landscaping, architectural changes, including structure entries, and grade alterations. 

(d) 	
The Commission may only approve the proposed extension of a nonconforming use where it determines that the following criteria are met:

The extension of the nonconforming use will not be inconsistent with the purposes of these Regulations and would not have a detrimental impact on other uses of the property, if any, and on surrounding properties occupied by conforming uses. 

(ii) 	
The percentage of extension will not result in an increase in a cumulative excess of 100 percent (100%) of the existing gross floor area or total land acreage occupied by the existing nonconforming use prior to the date set forth in Subsections (a) and (b) above. 






(iii) 	The increase of the nonconforming aspect of a use is the minimum possible so as to achieve an overall site development or use in greater conformance with the intent and purposes of these Regulations. 
(iv) 	All modifications or safeguards identified by the Commission as necessary or appropriate to further the purposes of these Regulations are required of the property owner and included as conditions of approval. 
D. Use of Nonconforming Lot of Record 
A building or structure may be erected as a permitted use on any existing lot of record which does not conform to the minimum required lot area or lot shape requirements of these Regulations, provided that:

Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/ or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
STRUCTURE  For floodplain management purposes, a structure is a walled and roofed building which is principally above ground, including a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures. 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  For floodplain management purposes, any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, alterations, additions, or other improvements to a structure, taking place during a one (1) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the 
market value of the structure. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other 
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term does not, however, include either: (a) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (b) any alteration of a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure. 
VARIANCE (Flood Damage Control)  A grant of relief from the terms of the floodplain management regulation that allows construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
VIOLATION (Flood Damage Control)  Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the communitys floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION  The height, in relation to the North American Vertical datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

ARTICLE 6 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 
§6.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading 
§6.1.1 Purpose and Applicability of Provisions 
The purpose of the off-street parking and loading standards is to ensure that such uses are treated as accessory uses, do not visually dominate the site, are properly placed in relation to buildings to minimize their visibility, and feature quality landscaping and architecture along the road frontage to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights and parking lot lights on adjacent roadways and neighboring properties. Off-street parking areas are to complement the buildings and other site improvements, improve the visual appearance of the property and surrounding neighborhood area, protect the character of residential, business, institutional and commercial areas, and conserve the value of land and buildings on surrounding properties. For any permitted use specified in these Regulations the standards herein for design of parking and loading shall apply. 
§6.1.2 Minimum Parking Space Requirements for Specific Uses 
Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the minimum standards for the uses as detailed in Article 10, Schedules  Schedule of Off-Street Parking. In no case shall a commercial, residential or mixed use development establish or permit a combination of uses which exceed parking facility design capacity, unless otherwise specified by these Regulations. Parking spaces in excess or less than of the minimum required standards (according to the provisions set forth in §6.1.9, §6.1.10 and §6.1.11 of these Regulations) shall be subject to the approval of the Commission, as the intent of these Regulations is to minimize the amount of impervious surface area in the Town of Monroe. 
§6.1.3 Queue Space 
Minimum queue spaces for each drive-through and exterior service window operating lane shall be provided for uses as specified below based upon the need to provide standing aisles for waiting vehicles. 
Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), Drive-up type: 3.0 spaces per machine. 
Bank: 8.0 spaces for a single lane facility; 4.0 spaces for each if multiple lanes. 
Car Wash: 14.0 spaces for each lane of a standalone principal facility and as determined appropriate by the Commission for a facility accessory to another permitted principal use. 
Gas Pump: 2.0 spaces for each pump or pump lane. 
Pharmacy: 5.0 spaces per lane. 
Restaurant: 8.0 spaces with a minimum of 4.0 spaces before the ordering speaker. 
All Other permitted uses as deemed appropriate by the Commission: No less than 2.0 spaces per window or access lane or such other number the Commission may prescribe based upon the unique characteristics of the use. 
§6.1.4 Loading Spaces 
A. 	Any nonresidential use containing a gross floor area (GFA) of 1,500 square feet or more shall provide one off-street loading space for 1,500 to 20,000 square feet of GFA plus one off-street loading space for each 20,000 square feet of GFA or portion thereof above 20,000 square feet of GFA. 
B. 	The Commission may waive the requirements for off-street loading space if in its judgment such space is not necessary or warranted for the use or development. However, the area for a future loading space must be documented so that it will be available for a future use, if needed. The Commission may require the deferral of any such loading spaces, consistent with the requirements for deferred parking as set forth in this Section. 
C. 	No off-street loading space shall be located in a front yard in any district. Loading spaces may be partially or fully contained within a structure. 
D. 	All loading activities and direct access to loading spaces shall be on-site only. 
E. 	All required loading spaces shall, at a minimum, be sized to accommodate small truck-type vehicles (SU30 or smaller). The Commission may require one or more loading spaces to be sized to accommodate a large truck-type vehicle (WB50 or larger). 
F. 	The location and access of all loading spaces shall include adequate and safe adjacent aisle space based on the size and type of vehicles to be served, as approved by the Commission. 
§6.1.5 On-Street Parking Not Accepted 
The use of on-street parking or portion thereof shall not be used for the calculation of any parking requirement contained in these Regulations. No off-street parking space shall be designed or located so that its ingress or egress is from any portion of a street or street right-of-way. 
§6.1.6 Handicap Accessible Parking 
A. 	ADA Compliance. Parking areas shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Act and the laws and regulations of the State of Connecticut. All handicap accessible parking spaces shall be designed and provided in number accordingly; such spaces shall be included in the total number of spaces required for structures and uses. 
B. 	No new structure, addition or use shall receive a Certificate of Zoning Compliance until the required handicap accessible parking, line striping and signs have been provided. 
§6.1.7 Multiple Uses 
Where separate parts of a building or structure or of a floor of a building are used for purposes requiring different numbers of parking spaces, the number of spaces shall be determined by adding the number of spaces required for the area devoted to each type of use. 
§6.1.8 Joint Use of Parking Facility 
Upon the authorization of the Commission, the owners of two or more abutting properties may establish a joint parking facility, which may be located on any of the properties involved, to provide the total number of required parking spaces. Upon establishing of a joint use arrangement, agreements shall be entered into by the property owners granting mutual use and access provisions to the parties and their successors in title in perpetuity.  Such agreement and corresponding cross easements of access and use shall be recorded upon the Land Records of the Town of Monroe. 
§6.1.9 Shared Use of Parking Facility 
The Commission encourages parking lots for different structures or uses, or for mixed uses, to be shared in any zoning district. Shared parking may be approved by the Commission, subject to the following provisions: 
A. 	The parties involved shall prepare and submit a draft proposed written perpetual reciprocal access and parking easement and maintenance agreement, which, following approval, shall be executed by the parties and recorded in the Land Records of the Town of Monroe. 
B. 	The Commission may require the applicant to provide a parking study with all information deemed necessary to its decision-making on a shared parking arrangement. This information includes but is not limited to: 
(1) 	
The type and hours of operation and parking demand, for each use. 

(2) 	
A Site Plan displaying shared use spaces in the lot and walking distance to the uses sharing the lot. 

(3) 	
A description of the character of land use and parking patterns of adjacent land uses, and d) an estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over the course of twenty-four 


(24) hours at the site. 
C. 	Parking spaces to be shared shall not be reserved for individuals or groups on a twenty-four (24) hour basis. 
D. 	Principal buildings sharing a parking facility do not need to be located on the same lot, but each principal building shall be a maximum of five-hundred (500) feet from the closest parking space in the lot providing the shared spaces. A waiver of the maximum allowable distance between the principal building and associated shared parking may be approved by the Commission with written justification and supporting information provided by the applicant. 
E. 	Uses sharing a parking facility shall provide for safe, convenient walking between uses and parking, including safe, well-marked pedestrian walks, crossings, signage, and adequate lighting, as approved by the Commission. 
F. 	If the conditions for shared parking become null and void, or uses change, such that the shared parking is no longer needed, and the shared parking arrangement is discontinued, this will constitute a violation of these Regulations for any use approved expressly with shared parking. The owner must then provide written notification of the change to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and, within sixty (60) days of that notice, provide a remedy satisfactory to the Commission to provide adequate replacement parking. Said remedy might involve the submission of an application to the Commission. 
§6.1.10 Reduction in Parking Space Requirements for Shared Parking 
A reduction in the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces may be approved by the Commission upon request by an applicant where a sharing of parking by a mix of land uses on the same or abutting properties can be shown to have operational and functional differences in their uses and peak demands for parking, as follows: 
A. 	Up to thirty percent (30%) of the parking spaces required for the predominant use on a site may be shared with other uses with different peak operating periods. The predominant use is considered to be that which requires the most parking of those sharing the parking facilities. 
B. 	Up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the parking spaces required for uses such as theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, nightclubs, movie theaters, and similar predominantly evening and weekend uses may be shared with uses such as banks, offices, and similar predominantly daytime and weekday uses. 
C. 	Up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the parking spaces required for uses such as churches and other uses exclusively in operation during the weekend may be shared with uses such as medical offices, banks, and other similar uses predominantly in operation on weekdays. 
D. 	The final number and layout of parking spaces shall be based on the need to protect public safety and convenience while minimizing harm to the character of the community and to rural, scenic, historic and environmental resources. 
E. 	Determining the parking requirements for any proposed structure or use, the Commission shall consider the parking standards for similar uses as set forth in these Regulations, together with the following criteria: 
(1) 	
The number of persons who would be parking at the site as employees, customers, clients, members, students or other users throughout a typical day and week, as well as the maximum number of persons at times of peak daily usage. 

(2) 	
The size of the structure(s), number and types of mixed land uses, and the site. 

(3) 	
The rural, environmental, scenic and/or historic sensitivity of the site. 


F. 	An applicant shall legally assure, to the satisfaction of the Commission in consultation with the Town Attorney, how staggered hours of operation will continue for the life of the uses. 
§6.1.11 Deferred Parking 
At the discretion of the Commission upon evaluation of anticipated current demand, or, if an applicant can demonstrate that the actual demand is less than the minimum required number of parking spaces for said use, the Commission may approve a deferred parking plan reserving up to twenty-five (25) percent of the total otherwise required spaces. 
A. 	Such reserved spaces shall be of standard design, shown in hatched lines on the Site Plan and labeled Deferred Parking, and shall be limited to natural areas. 
B. 	Land approved as deferred parking shall remain in its natural state or be landscaped, but shall not be used in a manner that would prevent it from being developed for parking in the future. The Commission may require the area of deferred parking to be rough graded to accommodate future development as parking without the need for notable excavation or filling. 
C. 	A covenant shall be executed guaranteeing that the owner will provide the additional spaces if the Zoning Enforcement Officer, upon investigation of the actual use of parking spaces at the site of deferred parking, recommends to the Commission that the approved deferral be modified or revoked. 
D. 	The Commission may require the future construction of said deferred parking, or portions thereof, into usable parking, within ninety (90) days of written notice to do so based upon a change in parking demand, a change of use or a change of traffic safety circumstances as determined by the Commission, and provided such notice shall take into account the time of the year suitable for pavement installation.  Failure to construct such spaces per such request shall constitute a violation of these Regulations and the Site Plan or Special Exception Permit associated with the deferred parking plan, as the case may be. 
§6.1.12 Employee Parking 
Employee parking is incorporated in the facility computation determined in §6.1.2.  The areas of the facility to be used for employee parking shall be those designated and approved by the Commission. In designating employee parking spaces, the Commission shall give primary consideration to spaces located farthest from the main building entrance. The Commission may require that approved employee parking spaces be appropriately marked or signed. 
§6.1.13 Design Standards 
A. 	Calculation Rounding 
All calculations for minimum required parking and loading resulting in a fraction shall be rounded up to the next highest whole number (i.e., 10.1 = 11), while all calculations for reduction in minimum required parking and loading resulting in a fraction shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number (i.e., 10.9 = 10).

§6.2 Landscaping and Lighting 
§6.2.1 Purpose 
These standards are intended to ensure the use and maintenance of quality landscaping and lighting throughout the Town in the protection of property values by preserving existing vegetation, ensuring the adequacy and appropriateness of new landscape plantings, screens and buffers, and minimizing light pollution. 
A. 	The Commission finds that quality landscaping and lighting provides many unique services and values to the community.  Landscaping softens the edges of buildings, screens undesirable places, makes large buildings appear smaller and more human scale, assists in maintaining biodiversity, and can create places for social gathering.  Vegetation recycles the air and water, absorbs pollution and sequesters carbon, buffers noise, and provides shade, air-cooling and windbreak protection.  Quality landscaping also helps control flooding and erosion of topsoil, provides habitat for birds and other wildlife species, buffers and screens incompatible uses, provides privacy from visual intrusion, light and noise, moderates microclimate conditions such as that within paved parking facilities by providing vegetative shading, absorption of reflected heat and creation of natural wind breaks, improves the quality of the environment, enhances property values and beautifies the community which ensures the maintenance of existing community character attributes deemed important to the Town. 
B. 	Quality lighting minimizes light pollution through use of appropriately designed, installed and maintained light fixtures which are fully and permanently fixed and shielded, which lighting is designed to be shut off when the facility served is closed. 
§6.2.2 General Landscaping and Lighting Design Standards 
A. 	The Commission is responsible for determining the adequacy of landscaping and lighting during the review of Site Plans, Special Exception Permits and Subdivisions. 
B. 	Landscaping and lighting within a site shall be designed to facilitate conservation of the environment and preservation of community character.  Site landscaping is to be designed to dominate development plans, integrating the various elements of site design, preserving and enhancing the particular identity of the site, and creating a pleasing site character.  Site lighting is to be designed to be subtle and ancillary to the overall site design of buildings and exterior facilities, providing the minimal lighting necessary to carry out the functional aspects of site operations while ensuring safety. 
C. 	The installation of new or replacement electric, telephone, television, and other communication lines, both main and service connections, shall be provided by underground wiring within easements of dedicated public rights-of-way, private roads, or common driveways, installed in accordance with the prevailing standards and practices of the utility or other companies providing such services unless waived by the Commission involving minimal changes relating to existing overhead services.  Said installation shall be coordinated to preserve existing vegetation and to not hinder the installation, growth and maintenance of proposed landscaping. 
D. 	The Commission at its discretion may require or approve an alternative plan, or waive or modify the particular requirements of this Section, provided the intent of these Regulations for providing landscaping and lighting are still otherwise achieved. 
E. 	Landscaping 
(1) 	
Existing vegetation shall be preserved as much as possible by minimizing clearing and grading in new developments and by avoiding the drip-line area of existing trees to remain in order to protect the tree's root system. 

(2) 	
New landscaping species shall be selected to minimize the need for irrigation, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers application. 

(3) 	
A variety of shade tree species to provide visual interest, to protect against same species die-out or disease, and for tolerance of road salt shall be provided.  Large-leafed and/or fruiting trees that may be considered a nuisance shall be avoided. 

(4) 	
Existing trees twenty (20) inches or more in diameter at breast height (dbh), or trees of lesser diameter as determined by the Commission and/or which are deemed to be locally important, shall be preserved to the maximum extent practical.  Locally important trees include, but are not limited to, rare or unusual species, trees associated with historic events or persons, or trees that contribute to an identified scenic viewshed. 

(5) 	
New development shall be generously landscaped to provide visual interest in all four seasons by including deciduous trees, conifers, perennials and annual bulbs. Landscape plans that are limited to deciduous trees and shrubs leave a barren winter landscape which fails to screen new development from the roadway and from neighboring properties. The landscaping of a site shall blend in with the prevailing scale, appearance and neighboring uses, and shall effectively screen incompatible development from its neighbors. 

(6) 	
Landscaping islands shall be used and designed to delineate vehicular and pedestrian patterns, integrated with the use of different colored and textured paving materials, raised or inverted areas, and other techniques used to further direct the flow of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic within a development site.  Landscape islands may include raised or depressed areas based on the integration of the landscaping and stormwater management controls.  However, stormwater management shall not compromise the need for landscape aesthetics. 

(7) 	
Landscape plantings of shrubs, ground cover, and shade and evergreen trees, as well as perennials and annuals and other materials such as rocks, water, walls, fences, paving materials and street furniture, shall be encouraged to create pedestrian-scale spaces and to maintain landscape continuity within the community.  As may be approved by the Commission, sculpture and art may also be integrated into the landscape plan, and is encouraged. 

(8) 	
Landscaping in combination with fencing and walls shall be required to provide all seasons screening and buffering of parking, loading and services areas, as well as site utilities, from view of adjacent properties and roadways. 

(9) 	
Landscaping shall be used and designed to create boundaries, transitions, screens and buffers between areas of differing development intensities, as well as to separate areas of incompatible land uses. 

(10) 	
Landscaping shall be provided generally at the base of and surrounding buildings, structures, refuse enclosures, recycling enclosures, mechanical equipment, free-standing signs and similar site features.  Freestanding light fixtures shall be installed in appropriately located, sized and landscaped areas and islands, or integrated with sidewalks and other areas outside of parking areas. 

(11) 	
Irrigation if proposed shall be detailed and the sufficiency of the water source and supply shall be demonstrated. 

(12) 	
Certain landscaping shall be installed with the following minimum sizes: 

Deciduous shade trees 3-3½ inches DBH 
Ornamental trees 2-2½ inches DBH 
Evergreen screen trees 10-12 feet in height 
Evergreen trees, general 6-8 feet in height 
Shrubs 2-3 feet in height/or 24-36spread 


(13) 	
All disturbed areas to be landscaped shall be restored with topsoil, in an amount not less than six (6) inches unless otherwise permitted by the Commission and specified on the landscape plan. 


F. Lighting 
(1) 	
Regulation of exterior lighting is intended to avoid excessively bright lighting that would cause direct or indirect glare, up-cast lighting or sky-glow, to avoid excessive contrast between lighted and unlighted sites creating hazardous driving or walking conditions, to avoid nuisance light spillover or glare affecting nearby residential properties or traffic and to distribute light levels more uniformly across a site. 

(2) 	
Exterior lighting shall be controlled in both height and intensity and shall be in conformance with the requirements established in these Regulations. The type, design, location, hours of operation and height of light fixtures and their mounting supports shall be approved by the Commission. 

(3) 	
The Commission may require site lighting levels to be reduced on all or part of the site at different times of the day, either after a facility is closed, or for 24 hour a day operations during period of reduced usage.  Such requirement shall be established as part of the review process. 

(4) 	
The Commission shall determine the maximum height of light fixtures on an individual project basis but in no case shall free-standing light fixtures in residential districts exceed fourteen (14) feet in height, twenty (20) feet in height in Business Districts and twenty-four (24) feet in Industrial Districts, except as otherwise may be permitted pursuant to Subsection G below. Wall mounted light fixtures shall include recessed light sources which do not produce horizontal glare.  Down lighting shall be required to prevent objectionable side casting of light to neighboring properties and adjacent land uses. 

(5) 	
Light fixtures shall produce low lighting levels targeted to the intended purpose of such lighting, including the use of full-cutoff and fully shielded light fixtures utilizing flat and recessed lenses attached to a pole or building on a fixed arm oriented parallel to the ground that cast little or no light upward, which minimize lighting overlap, reflection, and horizontal glare, as well as are turned off when their use and purpose are not necessary. 

(6) 	
Parking lot, walkway and other site lighting levels shall not exceed an average illumination level of three-quarters (0.75) to five (5) foot-candles at the ground. 

(7) 	
An applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission, that the light level at any lot line shall not exceed one-quarter (0.25) footcandle measured at ground level and that there shall be no adverse light spillage off the property or over wetland or watercourse resources. 

(8) 	
Foundation.  All light poles shall be grounded with a suitable permanent foundation.  All building or other structure mounted lighting shall be securely attached thereto. 

(9) 	
Measurement of light pole height.  The height of a light pole shall be measured from the finished grade or surface on which the light pole is mounted to the highest point of the light fixture. 

(10) 	
The architectural style of site light fixtures shall be consistent and complementary to the site architecture, or as otherwise required at the discretion of the Commission.

§6.6 Flood Damage Control 
§6.6.1 Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives 
A. 	Finding of Fact -Cause and Effect 
The flood hazard areas of the Town of Monroe are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
B. 	Statement of Purpose 
(1) Objectives 
It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(a) 
To protect human life and health; 

(b) 
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 

(c) 	
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 

(d) 	
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 

(e) 	
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 

(f) 	
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 

(g) 	
To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 

(h) 	
To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 


(2) 	Methods of Reducing Flood Losses In order to accomplish its purposes, this Section includes methods and provisions for: 
(a) 	
Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 

(b) 	
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 

(c) 	
Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 

(d) 	
Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood drainage; and 

(e) 	
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 


§6.6.2 Applicability 
A. 	This Section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the Town of Monroe. 
B. 	The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Fairfield County, Connecticut, dated June 18, 2010, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated June 18, 2010, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of Monroe, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and are declared to be part of this Section.  Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this Section it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA.  The areas of special flood hazard include any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM.  Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the FIS for a community.  BFEs provided on a FIRM are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location.  The Flood Insurance Study is on file in the office of the Monroe Town Clerk, Town Hall, 7 Fan Hill Road, Monroe, Connecticut. 
C. 	Compliance 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations. 
D. 	Abrogation and Greater Restrictions 
This Section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Section and another ordinance, regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E. 	Interpretation 
In the interpretation and application of this Section, all provisions shall be: 
(1) 	
Considered as minimum requirements; and 

(2) 	
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and, deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under the Connecticut General Statutes. 


F. 	Warning and Disclaimer of Liability 
The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by development construction activities or natural causes.  This Section does not, imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Section shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Monroe, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
§6.6.3 Administration 
A. Establishment of Development Permit 
A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in §6.6.2B. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or Town Planner, and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.  Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1) 	
Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 

(2) 	
Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; 

(3) 	
Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in §6.6.4B(2), and 

(4) 	
Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 


B. Designation of Administrators 
The Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Town Planner are hereby appointed to administer and implement this Section by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. 
C. Duties and Responsibilities of Administrators 
Duties of the Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Town Planner shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1) 	
Permit Review 

(a) 	
Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this Section have been satisfied and to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 

(b) 	
Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. 

(c) 	
Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. For purposes of this Section, adversely affects means that the cumulative effects of proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, increases the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 



(2) 	
Use of Other Base Flood Data 


When base flood elevation data and or floodway data has not been provided in accordance with §6.6.2B, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or Town Planner shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and or floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source in order to administer §6.6.4B(1). 
(a) 	
In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, require that no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. 

(b) 	
Should data be requested and/ or provided, adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point along the watercourse. 


(3) 	
Information to be Obtained and Maintained 

(a) 	
Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures. 

(b) 	
For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures: 

(i) 	
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level), and 

(ii) 	
Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §6.6.3A(3) of these Regulations. 



(c) 	
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance. 



(4) 	
Alteration of Watercourse 

(a) 	
Notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

(b) 	
Require that maintenance is provided within the altered area or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 



(5) 	
Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries 


Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions).  The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §6.6.3D. 
D. Variance Procedure 
(1) 	
Appeal Board 

(a) 	
The Zoning Board of Appeals, as established by the Town of Monroe, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Section. 

(b) 	
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or Town Planner in the enforcement or administration of this Section. 

(c) 	
Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Superior Court, as provided in the Connecticut General Statutes. 

(d) 	
In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Section, and: 

(i) 	
Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 

(ii) 	
Danger to life and property due to flooding and erosion damage; 


(iii) 	Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(iv) 	
Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 

(v) 	
Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 

(vi) 	
Availability of alternative locations, for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damages; 


(vii) 	Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(viii) 	Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area; 
(ix) 	
Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

(x) 	
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 

(xi) 	
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 



(e) 	
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xi) in §6.6.3D(1)(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 

(f) 	
Upon consideration of the factors of §6.6. 3D(1)(d) and the purposes of this Section, the Zoning Board of Appeals deems necessary to further the purposes of this Section. 

(g) 	
The Zoning Enforcement Officer or Town Planner shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 



(2) 	
Conditions for Variances 

(a) 	
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 

(b) 	
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 

(c) 	
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 

(d) 	
Variances shall only be issued upon: 

(i) 	
A showing of good and sufficient cause; 

(ii) 	
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 


(iii) 	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in §6.6.3D(1)(d) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 

(e) 	
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in §6.6.2B or §6.6.3C(2) of these Regulations, the following provisions are required: 
(1) 	Residential Construction 
New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
(2) 	Nonresidential Construction 
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
(a) 	
Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 

(b) 	
Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 

(c) 	
Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.  Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in §6.6.3C(3)(b) of these Regulations. 


(3) 	Manufactured (Mobile) Homes 
Manufactured (Mobile) homes shall be anchored on a securely anchored permanent foundation in accordance with paragraph A above. All manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation (BFE).  This includes manufactured (mobile) homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.

(4) 	Recreational Vehicles 
Recreational vehicles placed on sites within areas of special flood hazard shall either be on the site for fewer than one-hundred-eighty (180) consecutive days and be fully licenses and ready for highway use, or meet all the elevation and anchoring requirements of §6.6.4A(1) of these Regulations.  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
C. Floodways 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §6.6.2B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1) 	
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification, with supporting technical date, by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.

Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality. 
F. Aboveground Storage Tanks 
Aboveground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure if and where permitted elsewhere in these Regulations must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water. 
G. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone 
If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA.  The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone.  The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone. 
H. 	Structures in Two Flood Zones 
If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the more restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE).  The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure.  (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.) 
I. 	No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water 
New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility. 
J. 	No Enclosed Areas Below Base Flood Elevation

(1) 	
That the application, including all accompanying site plans and associated site development information, data and application documentation, is in conformance with the applicable provisions of these Regulations.

§9.5 Zoning Board of Appeals 
§9.5.1 Organization and Rules of Procedure 
There shall be a Zoning Board of Appeals as provided for in the Charter of the Town of Monroe, subject to the provisions of §8-6 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall adopt bylaws, which shall be the official rules of procedure for the Board. 
§9.5.2 Membership 
The number and term of regular and alternate Zoning Board of Appeals members shall be as set forth in the Charter of the Town of Monroe and the bylaws of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
§9.5.3 Powers and duties 
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have all the duties and responsibilities delegated to it by the General Statutes of Connecticut, including the following: 
A. 	To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by the official(s) charged with the enforcement of these Regulations or any by­law, ordinance or regulations adopted under the provisions of Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
B. 	Determine and vary the application of the terms of these Regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not be required to hear any application for the same variance or substantially the same variance for a period of six (6) months after a decision by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of competent jurisdiction on an earlier such application. 
C. 	Town ordinances. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall be empowered to act in a capacity as may be required by such other town ordinance enacted by the Town of Monroe. 
§9.5.4 Variances 
A. 	Variances may be granted only if in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these Regulations and with due consideration for conserving the public health, safety, convenience, welfare and property values, when solely with respect to a parcel of land and owing to conditions especially affecting such parcel, but not affecting generally the district in which it is situated, a literal enforcement of such Regulations would result in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship so that substantial justice will be done and the public safety and welfare secured. Before granting a variance on the basis of exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship, there must be a finding by the Board that the following conditions exist: 
(1) 	
That the difficulties or hardship are particular to the property in question in contrast with those of other properties in the same district. 

(2) 	
That the hardship is not the result of the applicants own action. 

(3) 	
That the hardship is not solely pecuniary. 

(4) 	
The variance must be shown not to substantially affect the comprehensive zoning plan. 


B. 	The concurring vote of four members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be necessary to vary the application of these Regulations. At the discretion of the Zoning Board of Appeals, conditions may be attached to any granted variance to ensure that the intent and purpose of these Regulations are preserved. Further, any variance granted shall: 
(1) 	
Be the smallest or minimal necessary to achieve the requested relief; the Zoning Board of Appeals in granting any variance shall be specific in regard to the extent to which any such standard or zoning provision may be varied. 

(2) 	
Be specific to the application at hand and shall not grant blanket relief of the standard or requirement varied (i.e., a granted building setback variance shall be specific to the building proposed at the time of the variance application and shall not vary or relieve the application of the underlying zoning district setback for a different, subsequent or future proposed building or building addition). 

(3) 	
Run with the land and shall not be personal in nature to the person who applied for and received the variance. A variance shall not be extinguished solely because of the transfer of title to the property or the invalidity of any condition attached to the variance that would affect the transfer of the property from the person who initially applied for and received the variance. 


C. 	The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not permit by variance any use not allowed by the provisions of these Regulations, and shall not permit by variance in any zoning district a use not allowed by the provisions of these Regulations in such zoning district. 
§9.5.5 Appeals 
Any person claiming to be aggrieved by any order, requirement or decision made by any official charged with the enforcement and administration of these Regulations may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days from the issuance of notice of said order, requirement or decision. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide the appeal and may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify any order, requirement or decision appealed from, and shall have all the power of the authority for whose decision such appeal is taken, but only in so far as to enforce these Regulations, where an error has occurred. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement or decision issued by said official. 
§9.5.6 Application requirements 
Appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 124 of the State of Connecticut General Statutes, as amended, and within the time prescribed by said statutes. Applications and appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be submitted, in writing, on a form designated by the Zoning Board of Appeals, together with any required fees. If the applicant is not the owner of the property, a notarized letter of consent from the property owner must accompany the application. Each application or appeal shall clearly set forth the action desired by the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall state the circumstances creating the need for such action, pursuant to §9.5.4 of these Regulations, and where applicable shall illustrate with maps and other drawings the location and nature of the appeal or application. 
§9.5.7 Public hearing and notification 
A. 	A public hearing shall be required for all applications for variance and all zoning appeals. All decisions shall be rendered not later than sixty (65) days after the close of the public hearing. 
B. 	Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the Town of Monroe not more than fifteen (15) days before the date set for the hearing. 
C. 	Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed to persons who own land within a one-hundred 
(100) feet of the property perimeter of the lot that is the subject of the hearing at least seven 
(7) days prior to the hearing. Proof of mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing. The person who owns land shall be the owner indicated on the last completed grand list of the Town of Monroe as of the date such notice is mailed. The applicant shall be responsible for mailing and all associated costs thereof. 

§9.6 Architectural Review Board 
§9.6.1 Statement of Purpose 
The Commission hereby finds that excessive uniformity or dissimilarity or inappropriateness and poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of buildings, structures and land developments adversely affects the desirability of the immediate area and neighboring areas and, by so doing, impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing property in such areas; impairs the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real property in such areas; adversely affects the most appropriate development of such areas; produces degeneration of property in such areas, with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the inhabitants thereof; and creates an improper relationship between the taxable value of real property in such areas and the cost of municipal services provided thereto. It is the purpose of these Regulations to prevent these and other harmful effects and to achieve an improved architectural balance and continuity of buildings, structures and land developments in the Town. 
§9.6.2 Organization and Rules of Procedure 
There shall be an Architectural Review Board (ARB) as provided for in the Charter of the Town of Monroe. The ARB shall adopt bylaws consistent with these Regulations, which shall be the official rules of procedure for the ARB. The ARB shall be advisory to the Commission. 
§9.6.3 Membership 
The number and term of regular ARB members shall be as set forth in the Charter of the Town of Monroe. ARB members shall be specifically qualified by reason of training or experience in a relevant business or profession or by reason of civic interest and sound judgment to assess the effects of proposed buildings, structures and land developments, including the alteration or demolition of such upon the property values and development of surrounding areas. To the extent possible, one member of ARB shall be a Connecticut licensed architect and one member shall be a Connecticut licensed landscape architect. 
§9.6.4 Powers and Duties 
A. Applicability 
The ARB shall review all applications submitted to the Commission for Site Plan or Special Exception Permit involving the construction, reconstruction, expansion, addition or alteration of nonresidential and multifamily buildings, structures and related site development. 
B. Referral to ARB 
(1) 	
Upon submission of a Site Plan or Special Exception Permit application to the Commission, a copy of same shall be referred to the ARB for its review and recommendation. 

(2) 	
The Commission at its discretion may refer any other application or agenda item to the ARB for its review and recommendation. 

(3) 	
The Commission, at its discretion, may determine referral to ARB is not warranted or necessary due to the limited or diminished nature of an application. In doing so, the Commission shall state the reasons in making such a determination. 


C. ARB Meetings and Procedures 
(1) 	
Regularly scheduled meetings of the ARB shall be held bi-monthly, as needed, and at such other times as the Chair shall designate. The ARB shall keep minutes of all its proceedings. Any recommendation made by the ARB shall have a majority consensus of its members and shall be officially filed along with pertinent data upon which such recommendation was based with the Commission. 

(2) 	
The applicant is expected to appear before the ARB to present its application, answer any questions ARB may have and to provide or supplement its application materials, including provision of architectural drawings, sections, details, renderings, color simulations and sample building materials to support its illustration of the proposal. 

(3) 	
The ARB shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days to review and render a referral recommendation report as it deems appropriate to the Commission, concerning the design of the proposed buildings, structures and their related site development. 

(4) 	
The ARB may request additional time in which to review the referral application due to scheduling issues or complexity of an application, which the Commission and/or applicant may grant, provided no extension of time shall exceed the time frames in which the Commission must act upon said application. 

(5) 	
Failure of the ARB to report within thirty (30) days, unless additional time to review is granted by the Commission or applicant, shall be deemed that the ARB has no comments on the application at hand. 

(6) 	
The ARB shall submit its recommendations to the Commission in writing for consideration as part of the Commissions application review process. Recommendations where changes or modifications to any submission are recommended, the ARB's report shall set forth the specific changes recommended and the reasons for same. 


§9.6.5 Application Referral Materials 
A copy of the application for Site Plan or Special Exception Permit as submitted to the Commission shall be referred to ARB for its review and recommendation, including but not limited to the following: 
A. 	Descriptive application materials, narratives and other written documents. 
B. 	Site Plan documents as specified in these Regulations. 
C. 	Architectural floor plans and details prepared at a standard architectural scale, including floor plans indicating the usage, circulation and square footage. 
D. 	Architectural elevations showing all sides of proposed buildings and structures, and including building heights, finished floor elevations, fenestration details, building materials and colors. In the case of enlargement, addition or expansion of an existing building or structure, both existing and proposed conditions shall be detailed. The provision of perspective drawings, renderings, architectural simulations and/or models are encouraged to illustrate the proposal. The Commission may require same. 
E. 	Samples of exterior building or structure materials, including color samples and textures shall be provided, including presentation of actual material samples. 
F. 	Photographs and/or sketches of adjacent areas, buildings or structures may be required to assist both the ARB and Commission in evaluating the design of the proposed application. 
G. 	Other specific documentation may be required by the ARB or Commission to assist both the ARB and Commission in evaluating the design and its compatibility to the site, the surrounding landscape pattern, adjacent land uses, buildings and structures, and the community character of Monroe. 
§9.6.6 Review considerations 
In considering any request for review brought before it, the ARB shall evaluate the design of all proposals through consideration of the following: 
A. 	Landscape and Environment: To prevent the unnecessary destruction or blighting of the natural landscape or the built environment, and to ensure that proposed conditions have been designed such that open spaces, buildings and structures on the site relate harmoniously to the natural environment and topographic conditions. 
B. 	Design of Buildings and Structures: The appropriateness of the site plan layout, architectural design and construction materials proposed in maintaining and/or enhancing the existing and cultural community character of the site and surrounding area, and the extent to which the proposal compliments, protects and will preserve the integrity, architectural character and property values of the Town. 
C. 	Relationship of Buildings and Structures: To ensure the appropriateness of proposed buildings, structures and/or land development in relation to adjacent buildings, structures and land development existing or for which a permit has been issued, or to other buildings, structures and/or land development included in the same application with respect to one or more of the following features: 
(1) 	
Appropriateness of architectural style and detailing, as well as the materials used or colors and textures proposed. 

(2) 	
The repeated and adjacent use of identical or near identical facades or structures arranged without respect to natural features of terrain or other existing structures. 

(3) 	
Gross differences in cubical content of floor area, height of building or roof, contrasting roof lines and/or architectural details and materials. 

(4) 	
Other significant design features, such as material or quality of architectural design, roof structures, dividing walls, accessory structures, chimneys, mechanical equipment and services, service and storage enclosures, signs and lights, landscaping, walls and fencing, parking and loading areas, and similar site features. 


D. 	Protection of Adjoining Uses and Properties: To protect adjoining users and owners ensuring that reasonable provision has been made for such elements as sound and sight buffers, the preservation of views, light and air, and such other elements of design which may have a substantial effect or impact on adjoining areas. 
E. 	Design of Accessory Elements: Aesthetic and functional review of signage, lighting, landscaping, refuse management, exterior art, and similar accessory elements. 

§9.7 Fees and Escrow Accounts 
§9.7.1 Fees 
Fees for applications to the Commission shall be in accordance with a fee schedule, recommended by the Planning and Zoning Department, accepted by the Commission and adopted or amended by the Town Council at a public meeting, and shall be posted or made available upon request in the Planning 
and Zoning Department and the Town Clerks office. 
§9.7.2 Escrow Accounts for Consultant Services 
A. 	The Planning and Zoning Administrator, his/her designee, the Commission, or the Zoning Board of Appeals may retain the services of a professional consultant, including but not necessarily limited to scientific, engineering, and legal consultants such as a land use planner, landscape architect, engineer, surveyor, architect, attorney, biologist, archeologist, soil scientist, traffic consultant, real estate appraiser, or other expert consultant to review, comment, and guide its deliberations on any application, and/or to provide inspection and/or monitoring services. 
B. 	Issues for which such review, inspect or monitoring may be needed may include, but are not limited to, compliance with existing laws and regulations; the potential for environmental or other impacts; the need for public improvements, drainage improvements, sediment and erosion-control measures, and other environmental safety measures; and the provision of adequate legal conveyances and financial performance security. It is the purpose of this Section to ensure that any fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Town in procuring such services be reimbursed by the applicant. 
C. 	Upon the filing of an application or during the course of its review, the Planning and Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, the Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals, may determine that one or more consultant(s) are needed to analyze, review and report on areas requiring a technical review, and/or to provide inspection and/or monitoring services. In making such a determination, the following shall be considered: 
(1) 	
That the evidence in the record of the proceedings has been produced or is likely to be produced which requires the hiring of such consultant(s); 

(2) 	
That the Planning and Zoning Department staff will be unable to perform the technical review; and 

(3) 	
That adequate time exists for the applicant to review and respond to such consultant(s) report(s). 


D. 	If the assistance of professional consultants is found to be necessary or appropriate at any time after the submission of an application: 
(1) 	
The Planning and Zoning Administrator, Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals may require an escrow account to be established from which withdrawals shall be made to reimburse the Town for the cost of professional consultant review, inspection and/or monitoring services. The applicant shall be provided with copies of any Town voucher for such services as they are submitted to the Town by its consultants. 

(2) 	
A preliminary estimate of the fees or expenses that such consulting services are likely to entail shall be considered in establishing an initial escrow deposit. The preliminary estimate, which shall not be binding on the Town, may be derived in any reasonable manner, including but not limited to a good-faith estimate of the hours that the consultant is likely to require based upon the specific nature of the application. 

(3) 	
The applicant shall provide payment to the Town of Monroe, in addition to all other applicable application fees, one-hundred-fifty percent (150%) of the above estimate, which amount shall be held in escrow until the technical review(s) are completed. 

(4) 	
Should the amount in the escrow account be reduced to less than one-third (1/3) of its initial amount, the applicant shall upon request by the Planning and Zoning Department promptly replenish the account to the amount of the initial deposit or other amount as deemed appropriate. 

(5) 	
After all pertinent fess or expenses have been reimbursed to the Town, the Town shall refund to the applicant any excess amount collected and remaining on deposit. 

(6) 	
The establishment, payment and maintenance in good standing of an escrow account shall be considered an integral component of the application. The failure by the applicant to establish the escrow account and make initial and subsequent payments as may be required shall render the application incomplete. 

(7) 	
No Certificate of Zoning Compliance, Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be authorized for issuance unless all professional review fees charged in connection with an applicants project have been reimbursed to the Town.

Residential and Farming E  0.30  
Business No. 1 and No. 2  0.75  
Industrial Park  0.75  
Restricted Industrial  0.75  

E. 	Pipe. All pipe for storm drains shall be reinforced concrete pipe. The minimum size of pipe shall be fifteen (15) inches. In special cases, asphalt-coated corrugated metal pipe may be used if approved by the Town Engineer. 
F. 	Slope. The minimum slope for storm drains shall be five tenths percent (0.5%). 
G. 	Hydraulic design. The hydraulic design of pipes shall be based on the Manning formula. The roughness coefficient (N) used shall be fifteen-hundredths (0.015) for concrete pipe and nineteen-hundredths (0.019) for corrugated metal pipe. 
H. 	Cover. The minimum cover over all pipe shall be two (2) feet. 
I. 	Intersections. Inlets shall be installed to properly drain all intersections of new streets and intersections of new streets with existing town streets. 
J. 	Easements. Easements at least thirty (30) feet in width centered on the storm drain, shall be provided for all stormwater and sanitary sewer pipes which will not be installed in streets to be dedicated to the town. Easements for outlet pipes shall extend to a suitable existing storm drain or an adequate natural watercourse. Easements shall be provided for ditches, channels or natural streams and shall be of sufficient minimum width to include a ten-foot access strip in addition to the width of the ditch, channel or natural stream from top of bank to top of bank. In addition, a minimum easement width of twenty (20) feet shall be dedicated, if required, on the rear line of each lot for the use of public utilities, poles, pipes and conduits, except where the Commission deems such easements impracticable or undesirable. 
K. 	Channel lines. Channel and building lines shall be provided along any major stream or river for the purpose of preventing encroachment upon and constriction of the natural water channel by buildings, filling operations or other facilities and construction. The width of the channel shall be based on sound engineering calculations, anticipating long-range storms and flow potentials and recognizing proper alignment and gradients of the channel. A note shall be placed on the final map explaining the channel and building lines and stating the restrictions against encroachment upon the channel in a manner approved by the Town Attorney. 
L. 	Catch basins, drop inlets and manholes. 
(1) 	
The first inlet in a storm drain system shall be located within three hundred fifty (350) feet of the roadway high point. Other than the first inlet, all inlets will be spaced a maximum of three hundred (300) feet apart. When the spacing between inlets exceeds four hundred (400) feet, manholes shall be placed to give a maximum length of pipe between structures of four hundred (400) feet. 

(2) 	
Drainage structures (catch basins, drop inlets or manholes) shall be placed at each grade change along a storm drain, at each change in horizontal direction and at each junction point of two (2) or more storm drains. Normally, drop inlets shall be used. In areas that are susceptible to the deposit of sand or debris, catch basins shall be used. Double-grate inlets shall be used at sags where, due to off-street runoff, a design flow in excess of three 


(3) cubic feet per second will be entering the inlet. 
M. Discharge. 	The discharge of all stormwater shall be conducted into suitable watercourses, wetlands, or into town drains with adequate capacity to carry additional water. Where the discharge shall be onto private property adjoining the proposed subdivision, proper easements and discharge rights shall be secured by the applicant for the town before approval of the final map and acceptance of the drainage plan. No storm drain shall outlet into a natural watercourse, whether continually flowing or intermittent, or into an existing drainage system, so as to exceed the capacity of the watercourse or drainage system, without provisions being made to satisfactorily increase the capacity of the watercourse or downstream structure. [Effective 6-1S-80] 
N. 	Underdrain. Underdrains shall be installed in all areas where wet conditions prevail or where required by the Town Engineer. Underdrain outlets shall be connected to drainage structures whenever practical. When impractical, they shall be terminated with an approved end wall. 
O. 	Outlets. All storm drain outlets shall be terminated with an approved outlet structure and shall be so constructed as to dissipate the flow energy in a way that will minimize the possibility of soil erosion. Crossing culverts for established watercourses shall extend no less than twenty-five 
(25) feet from the street line. Except for crossing culverts, storm drains shall terminate at least one hundred (100) feet from the edge of an established watercourse into a rip-rapped ditch or swale. Storm drains shall terminate no less than one hundred fifty (150) feet from a street line except where required to maintain the minimum setback from the edge of an established watercourse. If a discharge less than one hundred (100) feet from the edge of an established watercourse is proposed, it shall require the approval of the State Department of Health as required by the State Public Health Code. [Effective 6-15-80] 
P. 	Ditches. The use of ditches to carry stormwater to natural watercourses will not be allowed except in special cases, and then only with prior approval of the Commission. 
Q. 	Special structures. Bridges, box culverts, deep manholes, nonstandard endwalls and other special structures shall be designed in accordance with good engineering practice and shall be subject to the approval of the Commission or its agent. Bridges and box culverts shall be designed to carry at least the full width of the required street pavement and at least a four (4) foot sidewalk on each side. 
§ 111-303 Open spaces. 
A. 	Open Space.  In accordance with §8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes and consistent with the Town of Monroe Plan of Conservation and Development, no subdivision or resubdivision of land shall be approved unless proper provisions have been made for the preservation of open space in conjunction with such subdivision or resubdivision. Open space for natural habitat preservation (preserving natural features, wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, ridgelines and hilltops, significant trees, environmentally sensitive areas, stonewalls, areas beyond wetlands and watercourses a minimum of 100 feet), passive recreation and/or active recreation (parks and playgrounds) shall be formally reserved as part of all subdivisions and resubdivisions in places as deemed proper by the Commission. Such open spaces shall be preserved in perpetuity and conveyed to and accepted by the Town or other approved conservation non-profit organization with the recording of an approved subdivision map.  Land reserved for open spaces shall be of such size, location, shape, topography and general character as to be useful to satisfy the needs determined by the Commission. Proper pedestrian and vehicular access, parking, drainage, and environmental protection measures shall be provided for each such reservation. Open space shall abut and have direct access to a public street, unless such open space is proposed to be merged with an existing preserved open space parcel that has existing suitable street frontage and access as determined by the Commission.  Reservation of land shall conform to the Town Plan of Conservation and Development pertaining to parks, playgrounds, recreation areas and open space. 
B. 	Condition of Open Space Lands. The Commission, in requiring the provision of open space, shall consider the proper development of the town, the density of population and existing public open spaces in the vicinity of the subdivision. No loam, fill or natural growth shall be removed from the area reserved for open space, and no foreign matter shall be permanently placed upon said space unless required by the Commission in connection with the grading, construction or development of the subdivision or resubdivision. 
C. 	Area of Open Space Reservation.  All subdivision and resubdivision applications shall include a dedication of open space equal to or greater than fifteen (15%) percent of the total combined acreage of the subdivision property.  At least fifty (50%) percent of this open space shall be preserved as Useable Open Space containing: no wetlands (as defined by the Monroe Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations) or excessive slopes (greater than twenty (20%) percent). The Commission may partially waive this requirement and permit the required open space area to include additional areas of wetlands and/or excessive slopes where the total area of the property to be developed contains more than twenty-five (25%) percent of such areas.  In all cases the proportion of wetlands and/or excessive slopes that is included within the open space shall not exceed the proportion that exists within the total area to be developed. 
D. 	Method of Protection. The applicant shall submit with an application the necessary draft proposed map and legal instrument designed to ensure that designated open space lands shall be preserved in perpetuity.  The applicant shall be responsible for any filing fees due to the Office of the Town Clerk. 
E. 	Exclusions. The open space requirement set forth herein shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) lots is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision includes affordable housing as defined in CGS §8-39a, as amended, equal to twenty (20%) percent or more of the total housing to be constructed in said subdivision. 
F. 	Alternatives to Open Space Reservation On-Site.  The following alternatives to on-site open space reservation may be considered by the Commission only in instances where the Commission determines that the subdivision or resubdivision property does not possess lands suitable for open space reservation based on the criteria set forth in Subsections A through C above: 
(1) 	
Off-Site Land Reservation In lieu.  In lieu of the reservation of open space on-site, the Commission may approve the reservation of property located off-site which is equal to that otherwise required on-site, provided said property is also of suitable access, location and character as otherwise required if from the application property. 

(2) 	
Payment In lieu.  In lieu of reservation of open space on-site, the Commission may authorize a payment of a fee in lieu of, or may approve a combination of paying a fee to the Town of Monroe and preserving land in accordance with this Section, in lieu of part or the full requirement to preserve open space otherwise required by these Regulations. 

(3) 	
Market Value. Any in lieu fee payment, or combination of payment and the fair market value of the land to be reserved, shall be equal to ten (10) percent of the fair market value of the total land to be subdivided or resubdivided prior to the approval of same. 

(4) 	
Appraisal.  The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant, the cost of which appraisal is to be paid by the applicant.  Each such appraisal shall be prepared in conformance with the current version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and with such other standards as may be required by Connecticut State Law.  The Commission shall reserve the right to determine whether such standards have been met.  If the Commission finds that any appraisal was not prepared in conformance with such standards, it may reject such appraisal. 

(5) 	
In lieu Fee Payment. 

(a) 
At the option of the applicant, the applicant may submit: 

(i) 	
The entire payment may be provided to the Town in one lump sum prior to the recording of an approved Subdivision or Resubdivision Map with the Town Clerk; or 

(ii) 	
Equal fractional payments, the numerator of which is one and the denominator is the number of approved building lots in the subdivision or resubdivision, may be provided to the Town no later than the time of the sale of each approved building lot (i.e., prior to the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance and certificate of occupancy). With this election, notation describing this requirement shall be placed on the final Subdivision or Resubdivision Map recorded in the Town Clerk's office. 



(b) 
When fractional payments are elected to be provided in lieu of reservation of open space land, the applicant shall execute a lien for each individual lot in a form and substance acceptable to the Commission and Town Attorney, including evidence of satisfactory Certificate of Title.  Each such lien shall place the Town with first priority and shall state the exact dollar amount to be paid to the Town at the time of sale of the individual lot.  Such liens shall be recorded on the Town of Monroe Land Records. The fee in lieu shall be paid prior to the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance and certificate of occupancy for each individual lot.  A release of lien for an individual lot shall be provided by the Town upon the Towns receipt of the fee for that individual lot. The applicant shall be responsible for any filing fees due to the Office of the Town Clerk. 

(c) 
All payments of fee in lieu shall be deposited by the Town in the Open Space and Land Acquisition Fund (Chapter 60 of the Code of the Town of Monroe) as may be amended from time to time.  All fees shall be paid to the Town prior to the release of any subdivision or resubdivision bond. 




§ 111-304 Design of lots. [Effective 3-24-85] 
A. 	Lot size and arrangement. 
The area and width of the proposed lots shall conform to the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Monroe (8) and shall be of such shape, size, location and character that buildings can be constructed in conformity with the requirements of such regulations. The lots shall be as nearly rectangular as is practical. The design of lots to include unusable area consisting of unusual shapes and angles that deviate in the extreme from the practical rectangular design of the lot for the purposes of meeting lot standards of the Zoning Regulations, or maximizing the number of lots is not acceptable and shall constitute grounds for rejection of the proposal. 
(8) Editors Note: See Chapter 117 Zoning. 
B. 	Lot quality. 
The lots shall be of such character that they can be used for building purposes without danger to the health and safety of the public or the occupants. Any lot which is found to be unsuitable for buildings by reasons of water or flooding conditions, unsuitable soil, topography, ledge, rock, or other conditions shall be combined with another lot that is suitable or shall be marked "Not a Building Lot" on the final map until necessary improvements to the lot have been made and approved by the Commission. 
§ 111-305 Streetlights. 
A. 	When required by the Commission, the developer shall install streetlights at all intersections, including intersections of new streets with existing streets. Streetlights shall be in operation before any certificate of occupancy is issued. 
B. 	The developer shall be responsible for all operating' and maintenance costs until the streets are accepted by the town. Streetlighting installed shall be in accordance with standards established by the town or recommended standards for municipal streetlighting as established by the power company providing local service. 
§ 111-306 Marking of lot boundaries. 
All lots in a subdivision must be pinned or have monuments set at all points of significant changes in direction of the lot boundaries. Monuments will consist of concrete and pins will be of metallic composition with a minimum diameter of three-fourths (¾) inch and be forty-eight (48) inches long. Such pins or monuments shall be set with the top at grade level. 
§ 111-307 Pedestrian easements. 
In areas where the proposed street system does not conform to the anticipated pattern of pedestrian circulation, particularly in the vicinity of schools and playgrounds, the Commission may require the provision of ten-foot easements deeded to the town for the establishment of pedestrian ways. 
§ 111-308 Utility locations. 
All utility distribution and service lines shall be located underground with a depth and distance from the center line of pavement as specified in the Standard Specifications of the Town of Monroe or as directed by the Town Engineer and in compliance with all regulations of the Public Utilities Commission. 
§ 111-309 Reserved rights-of-way. 
When required by the Commission, the developer shall dedicate to the town reserved rights-of-way for future street connections to adjoining property susceptible to being subdivided. Such reserved rights­of-way shall be included in an agreement by and between the town and the developer and shall include slope rights fifteen (15) feet outside of the street rights-of-way. These rights-of-way shall have necessary radial intersections. Lots adjoining these rights-of-way shall be so laid out that access to a house or garage shall not be over the reserved right-of-way. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the developer of said adjoining property shall be required to connect to and build the street over the reserved right-of-way at his own expense. 
§ 111-310 Street trees. 
Street trees shall be planted on both sides of any street to be dedicated to the town. The developer may elect either to plant the trees himself or to contribute a sufficient sum to the Town Tree Planting Account to have such planting accomplished by the town. 
A. 	Tree specifications. The variety of tree shall be specified by the Town Tree Warden. Each tree shall be nursery grown, free from disease and bark damage, and shall have a minimum height of ten (10) feet and a straight trunk with a caliper of at least one and three-fourths (1¾) inches. The head of each tree shall be multiple-branched with the branches starting approximately six 
(6) feet above the ground. 
B. 	Location and spacing. Trees shall be planted on both sides of the street at locations designated by the Tree Warden. Trees shall be spaced approximately fifty (50) feet apart, subject to variations made necessary by driveways, street corners and walks. Existing trees along the proposed street which conform to these requirements may be used in lieu of new trees. 
C. 	Planting. A bare-rooted tree shall be planted in a hole twice the width of the spread of the roots. A balled tree shall be planted in a hole whose diameter exceeds that of the ball by at least twelve (12) inches. All holes shall be backfilled with good loam and shall be deep enough to set the trees on six (6) inches of loam at the bottom of the hole. All trees shall be planted as deep as they were growing at the nursery, and bare rooted trees shall be staked with three (3) wooden stakes one by one by six (1 x 1 x 6) inches and light cable secured with hose around the tree trunk.

Placards giving notice of the requested bond release shall be posted at the intersection of each subdivision street by the Commission to coincide with the publication of the first legal notice. 

(4) 	
The advertising and notice period shall consist of thirty (30) days commencing on the first day of publication of legal notice. 

(5) 	
Following the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, providing that no comment or unsatisfactory work has become apparent, the Commission shall recommend the road(s) to the Town Council for acceptance as town roads. The bond shall be eligible for release upon said acceptance. 

(6) 	
Should public comment be made or discovery of unsatisfactory work become apparent, said comment or work shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the Commission prior to recommendation for acceptance. 


§ 111-702 Maintenance bond and contract. 
Prior to the release of subdivision improvement bond, the Commission shall require the posting of a maintenance bond and signing of maintenance contract to cover correction of any defects in materials and workmanship, or omissions from approved plan, that may become apparent after release of the performance bond. Such bond shall be in an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the original amount of the performance bond and said bond and contract shall remain in effect for a minimum period of one (1) year from date of issue. Said bond shall be posted by irrevocable letter of credit through a recognized bank doing business in the State of Connecticut and with offices in the State of Connecticut, using form(s) prescribed by the Commission. No other form(s) shall be accepted. [10-1-87] 
§ 111-703 Release of maintenance bond.

ARTICLE VIII Waiver of Requirements [Effective 3-15-80] 
§ 111-800 Requests for Waiver. 
The Commission may waive requirements under these regulations by a three-quarters vote of all the members of the Commission in cases where conditions exist which affect the subject land and are not generally applicable to other land in the area, provided that the waiver is sought under one or more of the conditions contained in §111-801. No waiver shall be granted that will have a significant adverse effect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. The Commission shall state upon its records the reasons for which a waiver is granted. 
§ 111-801 Conditions for Waiver. 
The Commission may waive requirements of these regulations upon request of the applicant, or upon initiation by the Commission where owing to conditions especially affecting the subject land, a literal enforcement of these regulations would result in practical difficulty in its development, so that substantial justice will be done and the intent of these regulations secured. Conditions under which waivers may be considered shall be limited to the following: 
A. 	Topographic or geologic features making compliance with design standards as set forth in §§111-300 through 310 of these regulations impractical; 
B. 	Size and shape of property making compliance with design standards as set forth in §§111-300 through 310 of these regulations impractical; 
C. 	Inability of public utilities to provide service. 
In no case shall a waiver be granted without the Commission first receiving a report from the Town Engineer. 

ARTICLE IX Violations of Zoning Regulations [Effective 7-20-83] 
§ 111-900 Zoning Enforcement Officer; Report. 
Prior to the acceptance by the Commission of any application for subdivision or resubdivision, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall review the premises being the subject of the application and shall return a report to the Commission advising whether the premises are free of any violations of the Zoning Regulations (Chapter 117 from the Code of the Town of Monroe) or any violations which actually exist. No application shall be accepted by the Commission unless such report is received. 
§ 111-901 Effect of Violation. 
Should the Zoning Enforcement Officer find any violation(s} exist, no application shall be accepted by the Commission until such time as there is compliance with the applicable provisions of the Zoning Regulations, unless it is a stated intent of the purposes of the application to achieve compliance. 

ARTICLE X Water Supply Plan [Rev. 11-1, 1996] 
§111-1000 Method of water supply; requirements. 
Where any portion of property to be subdivided lies within a distance specified in §111-1001 of an existing public utility water supply main, all lots shall be supplied with water by the public utility, at no cost to the Town. Where any portion of property to be subdivided lies beyond a distance specified in §111-1001 of an existing public utility water supply main, the method of water supply shall be subject to the written approval of the Fire Marshal of the Town of Monroe, in consultation with other appropriate fire officials of the Town, and may be subject to such conditions which he may impose. The Fire Marshal, in his review, may take into consideration the requirement of public utility water supply, various alternative methods of water supply, or such other safeguards which may be deemed necessary to achieve fire safety. (For the purpose of this section: measurement of footage shall be from the existing water main terminus, along public road and/or approved subdivision road centerlines to a point perpendicular to the closest extremity of the subject property.) 
Statement of Purpose: The purpose of this section is to achieve continuing higher degrees of public safety through fire safety by providing more ready access to water supply and related appurtenances, while providing sources of potable water in the best interest of public health, as mandated in Chapter 126, Connecticut General Statutes. 
Waiver Provision: Upon written request by an applicant prior to approval of a subdivision application, the Commission shall consider waiving the requirement that the subdivision be supplied with water from a public utility at no cost to the Town (in the event of any part of the property to be subdivided lies within a distance specified in §111-1001 of an existing public utility water supply main) as to all or any part of the property to be subdivided which is the subject of the application. Said public water requirement may be waived subject to conditions as may be imposed by the Commission, in the event the Commission shall find that all of the following requirements are met: 
1. 	
That requiring public water would create an unusual hardship and substantial difficulty for the applicant, which arises out of conditions unique and particular to the property which is the subject of the application and the waiver request. 

2. 	
That the method of water supply proposed by the applicant as an alternative to public water complies with the provisions of this section relating to subdivisions which are not required to have a public water supply. 

3. 	
That the Monroe Fire Marshal approves unconditionally, the proposed alternate water supply plan and the alternate method of fire protection acceptable to the Fire Marshal. 

4. 	
That the proposed alternate plan of water supply will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, general welfare and property values of the general area and neighborhood. 

5. 	
That the future development of the property which is the subject of the application and/or of the surrounding area and the neighborhood as well as any anticipated future general needs of the surrounding area and Town in general will not be detrimentally effected by failure to supply public water to the subject property. 


The Commission's findings shall be stated upon the records of the Commission. 
§111-1001 Distance required for mandatory public water supply. 
A. 	Minimum requirement. The minimum distance for mandatory public water supply shall be five hundred (500) feet. 
B. 	Method of calculation. In the case of subdivisions of land resulting in four (4) or more lots the required minimum distance for mandatory public water supply shall be computed by multiplying the gross number of lots in the proposed subdivision by one half (0.5) times the minimum required street frontage of the underlying zone. 
C. 	Calculation of sectioned (phased) development. When a subdivision is to be performed in sections or phases, or has the potential to be performed in sections or phases the computation of distance (see Subsection B above) shall be made based upon the gross number of lots which can be attained from the parcel. 

ARTICLE XI Miscellaneous 
§ 111-1100 When effective; applicability. 
These regulations and any amendments thereto shall become effective on the date of adoption and shall apply to all subdivisions except as noted below:

Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life.
Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more.
The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state.
It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Monroe."
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission of the Town of Monroe, established in accordance with an ordinance adopted June 22, 1987 as further amended and hereby referred to as the Inland Wetlands Commission, shall implement the purposes and provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act.
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Inland Wetlands Commission (The Commission) shall enforce all provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act pursuant to sections 22a-28 et seq. inclusive, as same may be amended from time to time (hereinafter the Act) and shall:
a. Provide subdivision and re-subdivision reports with recommendations to the Planning and Zoning Commission;
b. Issue approvals/permits, or denials for regulated activities within all inland wetlands, watercourses, upland review areas and other regulated areas as further defined in these regulations and the Act;
c. Consider requested amendments to the regulations or the Town Wetlands Map;
d. Resolve issues relative to violations;
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 7 of 32
e. Provide determinations for uses termed as of right and/or non-regulated (See also Sec. 4.4);
f. Hear appeals relative to decisions of the wetlands agent;

d. The application shall describe any changes in facts or circumstances involved with or affecting wetlands, watercourses or upland review areas or the use of the land for which the permit was issued;
e. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of a permit, accept an untimely application to renew such permit if the authorized activity is ongoing and allow the continuation of work beyond the expiration date if, in its judgment, the permit is likely to be renewed and the public interest or environment will be best served by not interrupting the activity.
8.9 Application for Permit Renewals:
a. Any application to renew a permit shall be granted upon written request of the permit holder unless the Commission finds that:
1. There has been a substantial change in circumstances which requires a new permit application;
2. There is an increased potential for impact to the wetlands or watercourses due to the requested extension of time;
3. There is an apparent need for an enforcement action or there is an enforcement action pending with regard to the regulated activity for which the permit was issued.

d. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.9(c), any permit issued prior to July 1, 2011, that has not expired prior to May 9, 2011, shall expire not less than nine years after the date of such approval. Any such permit shall be renewed upon request of the permit holder unless the agency finds that there has been a substantial change in circumstances that requires a new permit application or an enforcement action has been undertaken with regard to the regulated activity for which the permit was issued, provided no such permit shall be valid for more than fourteen years.
8.10 The Commission may charge fees sufficient to cover the cost of reviewing and acting on applications involving issues that the Commission determines by a majority vote that additional analysis is required in order to assist the Commission regarding information submitted by the Applicant. Such fees may include, but are not limited to, the cost of retaining appropriate professionals to analyze, review, and report on issues warranting such analysis. Said fees will be established by the Commission and/or its agent, based on preliminary estimates from such professionals, and said estimate of fees times 150% will be paid to the Town by the applicant. The fees shall be paid pursuant to section 19 of these regulations within 10 days of the applicants receipt or notice of the amount due. Any portion of the fees in excess of the actual cost shall be refunded to the applicant after the publication of the Commissions decision.

10.1 Considerations for Decision:
The Commission may consider the following in making its decision on an application:
a. The application and its supporting documentation;
b. Reports from other agencies, commissions and officials including but not limited to the:
1. Monroe Conservation Commission
2. Monroe Planning and Zoning Commission
3. Monroe Town Engineer
4. Monroe and/or State Health Department
5. Applicable state agencies and/or commissions
c. Comments on any application from agencies including but not limited to the Southwest Conservation District, the Connecticut Metropolitan Council of Government, Aquarion Water Company or other regional organizations; agencies in adjacent municipalities which may be affected by the proposed activity, or other technical agencies or organizations which may undertake additional studies or investigations ;
d. For an application for which a public hearing is held, public comments, evidence and testimony;
e. The current Plan of Conservation and Development for the Town of Monroe.
Non-receipt of comments from state agencies and commissions listed in l0.l. b and c above within the prescribed time shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Commission.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 23 of 32
10.2 Standards and Criteria for Decision
In carrying out the purposes and policies of the Act, including matters relating to regulating, permitting and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Commission shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, which may include, but not be limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses including the effects on the inland wetland's and watercourse's;
b. The applicants purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses;
c. The relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity;
f. Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses;
g. Measures which would mitigate the impact of any aspect of the proposed regulated activity.
10.3 In the case of an application which included a public hearing pursuant to a decision by the Commission that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Commission finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. However, a conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a presumption that a permit should be issued. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the application is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Monroe and the Act. In making this decision, the Commission shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection 10.2 of this section of these regulations. The decision and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Commission shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate. This subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant in proving entitlement to the permit or in presenting alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 The Commission shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses. For purposes of this section, (1) wetlands and watercourses includes aquatic, plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) habitats means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 In reaching its decision on any application, the Commission shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Commission in its decision.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 24 of 32
10.7 An application may be denied without prejudice when a new/revised map and/or other new/revised information is submitted on the consideration deadline day, the last day of the hearing, or too close to the aforementioned days to permit adequate review of said information/map by commissioners, staff and/or public.
10.8 No permit to commence activity shall be issued until all applicable fees are paid.
10.9 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to subsection 7.9c of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide proof to the inland wetlands commission that granting of the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction. Upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction, the inland wetlands commission shall not grant the permit approval.
10.10 In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of subsections 7.9c or 7.9d of these regulations, the party holding the conservation or preservation restriction may, not later than fifteen days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands commission, subject to the rules and regulations of such commission relating to appeals. The inland wetlands commission shall reverse the permit approval upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction.
Section 11
Decision Process and Permit
11.1 The Commission, or its duly authorized agent acting pursuant to section 12 of these regulations, may, in accordance with section 10 of these regulations, grant the application as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the regulated activity designed to carry out the purposes and policies of the Act, or deny the application. Such terms may include any reasonable measures which would mitigate the impacts of the regulated activity and which would (a) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (b) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (c) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources.

11.3 The Commission shall state upon its record the reasons and bases for its decision.
11.4 The Commission shall notify the applicant and any person entitled to such notice of its decision within fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the Commission shall cause notice of its order in the issuance or denial of the permit, to be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town wherein the inland wetland or watercourse lies. In any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen day period, the applicant may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.
11.5 If an activity authorized by an inland wetlands permit also involves an activity which requires a zoning or subdivision approval, special zoning permit, or variance or special exception, under sections 8-3(g), 8-3c, or 8-26 of the Connecticut General Statues, the Commission shall file a copy of the decision and report on the application with the Town of Monroe Planning and Zoning Commission within fifteen days of the date of the decision thereon.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 25 of 32
11.6 Approval Expiration/Permit Issuance: The conditions of an approval must be met and the final plans accepted and signed by the Wetlands Agent within 270 days of the date of approval or said approval becomes null and void. The aforementioned plans (once stamped, signed and dated), and a completed permit form, constitute a permit.
11.7 No permit issued by the Commission shall be assigned or transferred without the written permission of the Commission.
11.8 If a bond or insurance is required in accordance with section 13 of these regulations, the Commission may withhold issuing the permit until such bond or insurance is provided.
11.9 If the Commission denies an application, the application shall not be resubmitted unless the proposal is modified in a fashion that reduces the impacts which resulted in the denial and/ or addresses the reason for the denial. Such re-submission shall take the form of a new application.
11.10 General provisions in the issuance of all permits:
a. No permits to commence construction shall be issued until all the appropriate pre-construction conditions of the approval have been met;
b. The Commission has relied in whole or in part on information provided by the applicant and if such information subsequently proves to be false, deceptive, incomplete or inaccurate, the permit may be modified, suspended or revoked;
c. All permits issued by the Commission are subject to and do not derogate any present or future rights or powers of the Commission or the Town of Monroe and convey no rights in real estate or material nor any exclusive privileges, and are further subject to any and all public and private rights and to any federal, state, and municipal laws or regulations pertinent to the subject land or activity;
d. If the activity authorized by the Commissions permit also involves an activity which requires zoning or subdivision approval, special permit, variance or special exception under sections 8-3g, 8-3c, or 8-26 of the Connecticut General Statutes, no work pursuant to the wetland permit may begin until such other approval(s) is (are) obtained;
e. In conducting the authorized activities, the permittee shall implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) consistent with the terms and conditions of the permit as needed to control storm water discharges, to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to otherwise prevent pollution of wetlands and watercourses;
f. Upon the completion of permitted activities, the Commission or its agent may require the installation of permanent markers indicating Regulated Area. Details of specific marker requirements may be obtained from the Inland Wetlands office.
11.11 An application deemed incomplete by the Commission shall be withdrawn by the applicant or denied by the Commission.
Section 12
Agent Approvals
12 .1 The Commission may delegate to its duly authorized agent the authority to approve or extend a permit for an activity that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when such Commission finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater than a minimal impact on any wetlands or watercourses provided such agent has completed the comprehensive training program developed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection pursuant to section 22a-39 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Requests for such approval shall be made on a form provided by the Commission and shall contain the information listed under section 7.5 of these regulations and any other information the Commission may reasonably require. Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing applications prescribed in sections 8, 9 and 11 of these regulations, such agent may approve or extend such an activity at any time, and may require a bond to assure acceptable completion of approved activity. The value of the bond may be determined by the Commission and/or its Agent upon assessment of the project, generally not to exceed $1,000.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 26 of 32
Any bond exceeding $1,000 must be approved by the Commission. The Commission has the right to control the requirements of any bond in accordance with section 13 of these regulations.
12.2 Any person receiving such approval from such Agent shall, within ten days of the date of such approval, publish, at the applicants expense, notice of the administrative approval in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town of Monroe and/or the towns in which the activity may have an effect.
12.3 Any person may appeal such decision of such agent to the Commission within fifteen days after the publication date of the notice and the Commission shall consider such appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting provided such meeting is no earlier than three business days after receipt by such Commission or its Agent of such appeal. Any person may appear and be heard at the meeting held by the Commission to consider the subject appeal. The Commission shall, at its discretion, sustain, alter, or reject the decision of its Agent or require an application for a permit in accordance with section 7 of these regulations.
Section 13
Bond and Insurance
13.1 Upon approval of the application and prior to issuance of a permit, the Commission may require as a permit condition the filing of a bond (or other form of financial security) with such surety in such amount and in a form approved by the Commission, and in such amount, as may be approved by the Commission, to guarantee that the applicant(s) and/or property owner(s) will complete all required work. A cash bond is the form of security generally preferable to the Commission, but the Commission may accept or require another form of security. The security shall guarantee, without limitation, erosion and sediment control, wetlands remediation, engineering and/or inspection fees, public noticing and costs associated with a cease and desist order and/or notice of violation.
13.2 The bond/security shall be conditioned on compliance with the provisions of these regulations and the terms, conditions and limitations established in the permit.
13.3 The bond shall be released to the permittee upon receipt by the Commission of a written request from the applicant and receipt of the bond report/recommendation from the Inland wetlands Agent including evidence that the proposed activities have been completed in a satisfactory manner. The Commission may, at its own discretion, release a portion of the bond amount if it is of the opinion that the permitted activities have been substantially completed and only a minor portion of the activities remain to be completed.
13.4 The bond can be called by the Commission to correct violations or compliance problems on a permitted site in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of these regulations.
13.5 The Commission may require the applicant to certify that it has public liability insurance against liability which might result from the proposed operation or use of the wetlands or watercourses covering any and all damage which might occur within two (2) years of completion of such operations, in an amount commensurate with the regulated activity.
Section 14
Enforcement
14.1 The Commission may appoint an agent or agents to act in its behalf with the authority to issue notices of violation or cease and desist orders and carry out other actions or investigations necessary for the enforcement of these regulations. In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Commission or its duly authorized agent shall take into consideration the criteria for decision under section 10.2 of these regulations.
14.2 The Commission or its agent may make regular inspections at reasonable hours of all regulated activities for which permits have been issued under these regulations with the consent of the property owner or the authorized agent of the owner during the life of the permit.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 27 of 32
14.3 If the Commission or its duly authorized agent finds that any person is conducting or maintaining any activity, facility or condition which is in violation of the Act or these regulations, is exceeding the conditions or limitations placed on a permit or the scope of work as set forth in the application, or has obtained a permit through deception or through inaccurate information as to either the activity or its environmental impact, the Commission or its duly authorized agent may:
a. Issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to immediately cease such activity and/or to correct such facility or condition. Within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of such order the Commission shall hold a hearing to provide the person an opportunity to be heard and show cause why the order should not remain in effect. The Commission shall consider the facts presented at the hearing and within ten (10) days of the completion of the hearing notify the person by certified mail that the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in effect, or that the order has been withdrawn. The Commission shall publish notice of its decision in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality. The original order shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the Commission affirms, revises or withdraws the order.
The issuance of an order pursuant to this subsection shall not delay or bar an action pursuant to section 22a-44(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended;
b. Issue a notice of violation to such person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation, the jurisdiction of the Commission, and prescribing the necessary action and steps to correct the violation including, without limitation, halting work in regulated areas (wetlands, watercourses and upland review areas). The Commission may request that the individual appear at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission to discuss the unauthorized activity, and/or provide a written reply to the notice or file an application for the necessary permit. Failure to carry out the action(s) directed in a notice of violation may result in issuance of the order provided in section 14.4.a or other enforcement proceedings as provided by law, including but not limited to, recording violations on the Town Land Records after notice and hearing, in accordance with Connecticut General Statues, as amended.
14.4 If it finds that the permittee has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work as set forth in the application including application plans, the Commission may:
a. Suspend or revoke a permit. Prior to revoking or suspending any permit, the Commission shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct which warrants the intended action. The Commission shall hold a hearing to provide the permittee an opportunity to show that it is in compliance with its permit and any and all requirements for retention of the permit. The permittee shall be notified of the Commissions decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain a permit by certified mail within fifteen (15) days of the date of its decision. The Commission shall publish notice of the suspension or revocation in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality;
b. Bring an action in Superior Court, pursuant to CGS section 22a-44 for the collection of all fines and penalties, together with all costs, fees and expense of such collection, including reasonable attorney's fees;
c. Bring an action pursuant to CGS section 22a-44 in the Superior Court, in all cases of continuing violation, for an order restraining such continuing violation and for such orders directing that the violation be corrected or removed as the Commission, pursuant to a public hearing, deems necessary and appropriate for the protection of inland wetlands and watercourses, and for the costs, fees and expenses of such action together with reasonable attorney's fees.
14.5 Nothing in these regulations shall be taken as limiting or excluding such other remedies as are available to the Commission for the protection of inland wetlands and watercourses, including, but not limited to, suits under CGS sections 22a-14 through 22a-20 for the protection of natural resources, and any legal or equitable powers or remedies that may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations Page 28 of 32
14.6 Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of these regulations may be fined the maximum allowed by law as per CGS section 22a-44, and to such other penalties as the law may provide. Each violation of said regulations shall be a separate and distinct offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, each days continuance thereof shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct violation. The Superior Court, in an action brought by the Commission, shall have jurisdiction to restrain a continuing violation of said regulations and to issue orders directing the violation to be corrected or removed. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such action shall be assessed as damages against the violator.
