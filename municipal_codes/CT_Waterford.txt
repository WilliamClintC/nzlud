WATERFORD, CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Town of Waterford, Connecticut 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Waterford, Connecticut, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1991, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Calvin K. Brouwer, town clerk. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning in November 2009, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through amendments of February 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of November 2009, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of November 2009, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Nominations and elections of a candidate as a member of the representative town meeting under this charter shall be made in accordance with subsections (a)-(g), inclusive, of this section as follows. 
(a)  The nomination and election of candidates as members of the representative town meeting may be in the same manner as provided for the nomination and election of the town officers in the general statutes so far as they are not superseded by this charter, provided (1) no political party shall nominate more candidates for each district than two-thirds of the members to which such district may be entitled, such candidates to be resident electors of the district for which they have been nominated provided, if the number of members to which a district is entitled is not divisible by three, each political party may nominate the next highest whole number in excess of such two-thirds, and (2) nomination of a candidate as member of the representative town meeting may also be made by petition signed in ink on forms approved and provided by the town clerk, said petition to be signed by not less than one hundred resident electors of the district in which the candidate resides and shall be filed with the town clerk not less than sixty days prior to the election.

A petition may contain more than one name but not more names than the number of candidates which a political party may nominate under this charter for the same district at the forthcoming election. 
(b)  The town clerk shall, at least twenty-one days before the time of holding the election at which the nominees are to be voted for, certify and transmit the names of candidates nominated in accordance with this charter to the Secretary of the State, and the town clerk shall prepare ballot labels for each district for such election of members of the representative town meeting, and shall post certified lists in the hall of records and publish the same in a newspaper having circulation in the Town of Waterford each successive full week thereafter until election.

(f)  An elector may vote for any number of candidates to be elected as members of the representative town meeting in the district wherein such elector shall reside, provided that an elector shall vote for no more than the number to be elected. 
(g)  That number of candidates in each district sufficient to fill the number of members of the representative town meeting to which such district may be entitled who have polled the highest number of votes shall be declared elected. 
(Amended 11-8-94, effective 12-8-94) 
3.1.10 - VACANCIES. 
Any representative may resign by filing a written resignation with the town clerk and such resignation shall take effect upon the date of filing. The town clerk shall, within seven days, publish notice of any vacancy in the office of district representative to the town meeting, which vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term at a special meeting of the representatives of the district in which said vacancy occurs, called for that purpose by the town clerk, within thirty days of such notice. Such meeting shall elect its own chairman and clerk and shall vote by ballot. If the person previously occupying the office which is vacant had been elected as a nominee of a political party, the vacancy shall be filled by a person of the same political party. The vacancy shall be filled from a slate of no less than three persons eligible for election as a representative from said district who have been nominated by the same political party, in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes for nomination of town officers, provided the names of said persons have been submitted to the town clerk and said persons have signified their willingness to stand for election as a member of the representative town meeting. If such slate shall not have been submitted, or fewer than three persons thereon are willing to accept such election, the representatives of the district shall not be obligated to fill the vacancy from such slate. The election of a representative as chairman or clerk shall not disqualify him from voting. A majority shall constitute a quorum, and a majority vote of those present shall elect. The successful candidate shall be deemed a duly qualified representative for the remainder of the unexpired portion of the term upon filing with the town clerk a certificate of his election signed by the chairman of such special meeting of the district. 
3.1.11 - REGULAR AND SPECIAL MEETINGS. 
(a) The annual town budget meeting shall be held on the first Monday of May. The annual representative town meeting shall be held on the first Monday of December. Regular meetings shall be held on the first Monday of February, April, June, August and October. Such meetings shall be held upon the warning of the moderator or, in his absence or inability, of the town clerk. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to change the date of the regular biennial meeting of all the electors for the election of town officers. 
(b)  Special meetings of the representative town meeting shall be held upon the warning of the moderator or, in his absence or inability, of the town clerk, or upon written petition therefor received by the moderator from the first selectman or two or more representatives or fifty electors of the town. Special meetings may also be called by the moderator after written notice has been given by him to the town clerk of his intent to call a special meeting. Said notice shall contain a general description of items to be placed on the call of such special meeting. Special meetings shall be held upon the warning of the moderator or, in his absence or inability, of the town clerk, within thirty days of receipt of said notice or said petition. 
(c)  The town clerk shall notify all representatives of the time, place and purpose of said meeting by providing a copy of the warning to each member at least five days before the date of the meeting in the manner specified by the Representative Town Meeting Rules of Procedure, and shall cause to be published a copy of the warning in a newspaper of current circulation in the town of Waterford at least five days before the date of the meeting. 
3.1.12 - PROCEDURE. 
(a) All representative town meetings shall be public and any duly qualified elector or a property holder who, except as otherwise provided in this charter, would be qualified to vote at town meetings pursuant to Section 7-6 of the General Statutes, may speak at such meeting upon recognition by the moderator, but shall not vote. 
(b)  All representative town meetings shall be called to order by the moderator, or, in his absence, by the first selectman. 
(c)  The representative town meeting shall, at its first annual meeting and annually thereafter, elect from among its elected members a moderator, who shall act as moderator of all representative town meetings for a term of one year and until his successor is elected and has qualified. Election of a moderator shall not disqualify him from voting in the representative town meeting. In the absence of the moderator, the representative town meeting may elect, by majority vote, a moderator pro tempore. The town clerk shall act as clerk of all meetings. 
(d)  A majority of the elected members of the representative town meeting shall constitute a quorum. A lesser number may organize temporarily and adjourn, but may take no other action. 
(e)  The representative town meeting shall establish its own rules of procedure, not inconsistent with any of the provisions of this charter. 
(f)  The representative town meeting shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its members. A majority vote shall be sufficient to determine questions arising under this subsection. 
(g)  Upon written request of an elector, or of a property owner qualifying as provided in subsection (2) hereof, presented at any representative town meeting at which a quorum is present, asking that the vote on a question be taken by roll call, the vote on the question specified in the request shall be by roll call. 
3.1.13 - WHEN ACTION OF REPRESENTATIVE TOWN MEETING BECOMES EFFECTIVE. 
(a) Within one week after legislative action, including the enactment of ordinances, has been taken at a meeting of the representative town meeting, the town clerk shall make available for examination copies of such legislative action except that ordinances shall be published as currently provided by law. Such legislative action shall become effective fifteen days after enactment, unless a petition for a referendum thereon shall have been previously filed, as provided in Section 3.1.14 herein, in which event such legislative action shall not become effective unless and until approved by such referendum, provided emergency legislation shall become effective immediately, but shall be subject to repeal, modification or approval by a referendum held pursuant to Section 3.1.14 herein. Legislation shall be deemed emergency legislation only when so designated by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of the duly elected and qualified representatives, which vote shall specify briefly the facts constituting such emergency. 
(b)  The town clerk shall keep a record of the attendance of representatives and of all actions taken by vote of the representative town meeting and of all legislation passed by it, together with a record of the vote cast by each representative upon all action taken by a roll call vote as provided by law in books kept by him for that purpose, and such books shall constitute a public record. 
(1)  If a referendum is being held from an action of the representative town meeting (other than an appropriation) the labels on the machines shall state separately each matter to be voted on, in substantially the following form: "Shall the following action by a representative town meeting held on (date) be approved?" followed by a statement of the action in substantially the same language and form in which it appears in the records of such town meeting, and the voting machine shall provide a means of voting "yes" or "no" on each question so presented. 
(2)  If the referendum is being called from an appropriation made by a representative town meeting, the labels on the machine shall state separately each matter to be voted on, in substantially the following form: "Shall an appropriation approved by the representative town meeting in the sum of $_______ for (state the purpose) be decreased (or increased, as the case may be) to the sum of $_______?" and the voting machine shall provide a means of voting "yes" or "no" on each question so presented. 
3.1.14 - REFERENDUM ON ACTS OF REPRESENTATIVE TOWN MEETING. 
The electors of the town shall have the power by referendum to reverse or approve any action of the representative town meeting. Further, the electors of the town shall have the power by referendum to reverse, approve, or modify any appropriation made by the representative town meeting, provided however, that in the case of a referendum to increase an appropriation, the maximum increase shall be to the amount requested of the board of finance by the affected board or agency, and provide further, that in those cases where no appeal is taken to the representative town meeting from budget cuts imposed by the board of finance, the maximum level of funding which may be restored by referendum shall be the total recommended by the board of finance. However, no appointment made by the representative town meeting may be affected by subsequent referendum in accordance with this Section. Any action of or appropriation made by the representative town meeting shall have an effective date in accordance with Section 3.1.13(a) of this charter before it is subject to referendum in accordance with this section. The procedure for holding a referendum as provided for herein is as follows: 
(a)  If a written petition is filed with the town clerk before the effective date of any act (including an appropriation) of the representative town meeting as provided in Section 3.1.13(a) of this charter, which petition requests that a specific act or acts or appropriation of the representative town meeting be referred to a vote of all the electors of the town, and if such petition is signed by electors in ink in number not less than five (5) percent of the total number of electors in the town as of the date of the last certification thereof by the registrars of voters pursuant to Section 3.1.8 herein, the selectmen shall call a referendum of electors to be held not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days from the filing of said petition for the purpose of voting approval or reversal of such act or acts or reversal, approval, or modification of such appropriation. 
(b)  Voting shall be held in the respective voting districts of the town.

Chapter 2.50 - ETHICS COMMISSION 

2.50.010 - Preamble and declaration of policy and purpose. 
A.  Public office is a public trust. The trust of the public is essential for government to function effectively. Public policy developed by government officials and employees affects every citizen of the municipality, and it must be based on honest and fair deliberations and decisions. This process must be free from threats, undue influence, and all forms of impropriety, so that the confidence of the public is not eroded. By enacting this code of ethics, the Town of Waterford seeks to avoid any loss of trust and to maintain and increase the confidence of our citizens in the integrity and fairness of their government. 
B.  The proper operation of the town government of the town requires that all public officials and town employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, shall be impartial and responsive to the public interest; that public office and employment should not be used for personal gain or advantage; and that public office is a trust conferred by public authority for a public purpose. Public officials and town employees should not place themselves in positions where private interest conflicts with public duty. The administration of legislative or quasi-judicial power demands the highest public confidence. Anything which tends to weaken such confidence and to undermine the sense of security of individual rights which the citizen is entitled to feel is against public policy. 
C.  In recognition of these principles and pursuant to Sections 7-148(c)(10)(B) and 7-148h of the Connecticut General Statutes there is established a code of ethics for all public officials and employees, paid or unpaid, of the town. 
(R.T.M. 6-1-92 (part)) 
(Amend. of 2-4-13(1)) 
2.50.020 - Definitions.

"Officer" refers only to the president, executive, or senior vice president or treasurer of such business. 
B.  "Gift" means a payment, subscription, advance, forbearance, rendering of service, deposit of money, or anything of value, which is directly and personally received, unless consideration of equal or greater value is given in return. Gift shall not include: 
1.  A political contribution otherwise reported as required by law; 
2.  Services provided to support a political candidate or political party without compensation by persons volunteering their time;

7.  An award publicly presented in recognition of public service; or 
8.  Any gift which would have been offered or given to the individual regardless of the individual's status as a public official or town employee.

D.  "Individual" means a natural person. 
E.

F.  "Official act or action" means any legislative, administrative, appointed or discretionary act of any public official or town employee or of any department, agency, board, committee, or commission of the town. 
G.  "Person" means any individual, business, corporation, union, association, firm, partnership, committee, club or other organization or group of persons.

(R.T.M. 6-1-92 (part)) 
2.50.030 - Code of ethics. 
A.  A public official or town employee has an interest which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of duties or employment in the public interest and of responsibilities as prescribed by the laws of this state, if the public official or town employee has reason to believe or expect that the public official or town employee, his spouse or a dependent child, or a business with which he is associated, will derive a direct monetary gain or suffer a direct monetary loss, as the case may be, by reason of the public official or town employee's official activity. The public official or town employee does not have an interest which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of duties in the public interest and of responsibilities as prescribed by the laws of this state, if any benefit or detriment accrues to the public official or town employee, his immediate family, or a business with which he or his immediate family is associated as a member of a profession, occupation or group to no greater extent than any other member of such profession, occupation or group. 
B.  A public official or town employee may not take official action on any matter where a substantial conflict (as defined in subsection A of this section) exists. If the conflict is disclosed, a public official or town employee may participate in discussions with or give opinions or recommendations to a town board, agency, commission, committee, department or another public official or town employee. 
C.  Public officials and town employees shall refrain from using their positions for personal gain and will keep confidential all information not available to all citizens that is acquired by virtue of their position in the town government. 
D.  Public officials and town employees shall not request, permit or engage in the unauthorized use of town-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit.

F.  No public official or town employee shall enter into any non-bid contract with the town exceeding five hundred dollars or a series of non-bid contracts exceeding two thousand dollars in any one year. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent any public official or town employee from submitting a competitive sealed bid in response to an invitation to bid from the town purchasing agent or any commission, board, agency or committee provided such person does not violate subsection A of this section. Town employee union contracts with the town are not subject to the prohibition of this section. Employee contracts by nonunion personnel are also not subject to the prohibition of this section. 
G.  No public official or town employee shall seek or grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen. No town employee shall seek any special consideration regarding the employee's employment from any town employee or public official. No town employee shall use the employee's position to directly benefit any political party or candidate for public office. 
(R.T.M. 6-1-92 (part)) 
2.50.040 - Establishment of an ethics commission. 
    In accordance with the provision of Section 7-148h of the Connecticut General Statutes there is created an ethics commission. This commission is empowered to investigate or to cause to be investigated allegations levied against any town board, agency, commission, committee, official or employee of unethical conduct, corrupting influence, or illegal activities. Allegations of criminal misconduct or violations of the state penal code shall be referred to the police department or State's Attorney's office whenever such allegations come to the attention of the commission, whether upon receipt of a complaint or during the course of an investigation. Notwithstanding provisions herein to the contrary, established internal complaint procedures of any town board, agency, commission or committee, as such procedures may be amended, shall take precedence over the procedures established herein as to allegations levied against any town employee of such board or commission. Complaints which fall under the purview of an established complaint procedure of an agency shall be referred to that agency for disposition. The commission may issue subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum, enforceable upon application to the superior court, to compel the attendance of persons at hearings and the production of books, documents, records and papers. The commission shall not initiate investigations on its own volition. 
    The commission shall be comprised of seven resident electors, none of whom shall be town employees or public officials. Two of the appointed members will be designated as alternates by the representative town meeting (R.T.M.). All members shall be appointed by majority vote of the R.T.M. No more than four members shall be members of the same political party. Of the five members initially appointed, three shall be appointed for a term of two years and two for a term of one year. One of the alternates shall be appointed for a term of two years and one shall be appointed for a term of one year. All subsequent appointments to the commission shall be for a term of two years. Any regular member having served three consecutive two-year terms shall be ineligible for reappointment to the commission for a period of two years. For individuals filling a vacancy, consecutive terms of service shall commence with the beginning of the next appointment term. The two alternative members may fully participate in all hearings and discussions but may not vote unless a regular member steps aside or is not present at the time of the vote. No more or less than five members shall ever vote on any decision of the commission and, to be eligible to vote, the members must have been in attendance at all meetings at which testimony was presented. A person will not be disqualified from serving on the commission if a member of his immediate family is employed by the town or by the Waterford board of education or is a public official; however, if an accused person is an immediate family member or an immediate family member's supervisor or employed in the same department as a member of his immediate family, the commission member will be disqualified from voting on that particular matter. 
(R.T.M. 6-1-92 (part))

B.  Any advisory opinion concerning the public official or town employee who requested the opinion and who acted in reliance thereon, in good faith, shall be binding upon the commission and it shall be an absolute defense in any action brought under the provisions of the code of ethics (Section 2.50.030 of this code) that the accused party acted in reliance upon such advisory opinion, assuming there are no relevant facts of which the commission was not aware when the opinion was rendered that would change the opinion of the commission. 
C.  Each opinion of the ethics commission shall include a disclaimer to the effect that the opinion may be different if different facts are presented to the commission at a later date. 
(R.T.M. 6-1-92 (part)) 
2.50.070 - Procedure for receiving and hearing complaints.

A town employee who discloses illegal activities or unethical practices is protected by Section 31-51m of the Connecticut General Statutes from discharge, discipline or other penalty unless the town employee knows the report is false. If the person makes a false statement, the person shall be subject to fines under the provisions of Section 53a-157 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
B.  Unless the commission makes a finding of probable cause, a complaint alleging a violation of the code of ethics shall be confidential except upon the request of the respondent. A commission evaluation of a possible violation of the code of ethics prior to the filing of an opinion by the commission shall be confidential except upon the request of the subject of the evaluation. If the evaluation is confidential, any information supplied to or received from the commission shall not be disclosed to any third party by a subject of the evaluation, a person contracted for the purpose of obtaining information or by a commission, board or agency or staff member. No provision of this subsection shall prevent the ethics commission from reporting the possible commission of a crime to police department or State's Attorney's office as appropriate. 
C.  An investigation conducted prior to a probable cause finding shall be confidential except upon the request of the respondent. If the investigation is confidential, the allegations in the complaint and any information supplied to or received from the commission shall not be disclosed during the investigation to any third party by a complainant, respondent, witness, designated party, or board, commission or agency or staff member. 
D.  Upon receiving a complaint of an alleged violation of the code of ethics, the commission shall, within seven days, notify in writing the respondent, advising the respondent of the specific nature of the complaint made and being investigated by the commission, and enclosing therewith a copy of the complaint.

After notifying the respondent, the commission shall make a preliminary investigation of the validity of the complaint including interviews or discussions with the complainant, town personnel or members of other public or private agencies. The preliminary investigation shall be completed within ninety days after notifying the respondent unless the commission notifies the complainant and the respondent in writing that additional time is required.

E.  Not later than three business days after the termination of the investigation, the commission shall inform the complainant and the respondent and, at the discretion of the commission, the respondent's appointing authority or elected body, of its opinion as to probable cause and provide them a summary of its reasons for forming that opinion. Upon the respondent's request, the commission shall publish its opinion and may also publish a summary of its reason for forming such opinion. 
F.  If the commission finds no probable cause for such complaint, the commission shall dismiss the complaint. In that event the complaint and the record of its investigation shall remain confidential, except upon the request of the respondent and except that some or all of the record may be used in subsequent proceedings. No complainant, respondent, witness, designated party, or commission, board or agency or staff member shall disclose to any third party any information learned from the investigation, including knowledge of the existence of a complaint which the disclosing party would not otherwise have known. If such a disclosure is made, the commission may, after consultation with the respondent if the respondent is not the source of the disclosure, publish its opinion and a summary of its reasons therefor. 
G.  The commission shall make public an opinion of probable cause not later than five business days after the termination of the investigation. At such time the entire record of the investigation shall become public, except that the commission may postpone examination or release of such public records for a period not to exceed fourteen days for the purpose of reaching a stipulation agreement pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 4-177 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
H.  Within ten days after receipt of notice of an opinion of probable cause, the respondent may waive the right of a hearing by the commission.

(R.T.M. 10-5-98) 
3.12.160 - Tax abatement for volunteer firefighters. 
A.  Definitions. 
1.  "Firefighter" includes any firefighter certified as a Firefighter I or greater by the state of Connecticut Commission on Fire Prevention and Control or any fireperson appointed as a fire-police by the chief of any fire company or department to perform fire police duties per Connecticut General Statutes Section 7-313A. 
2.  "EMT (emergency medical technician)" means an individual who has successfully completed the requirements of the State of Connecticut, Department of Health Services Office of Emergency Medical Services, and shall include EMT-P (emergency medical technician-paramedic) and MRT (medical response technician). 
B.  In order to efficiently administer this abatement program, two separate processes will occur each year: 
1.  A determination of who is eligible for the program and their level of participation. 
2.  A computation of the abatement by the tax collector. 
    The next two subsections describe these two processes. 
C.  To be eligible for the tax abatement pursuant to this section for any calendar year, a firefighter/EMT must have served as a volunteer firefighter/EMT for a Waterford Volunteer Fire Company/Department for not less than one immediately preceding calendar year, or a resident of a town with whom Waterford has executed an inter-local agreement for purposes of participating in this abatement program. The director of fire services shall on or before March 1st prior to such the next fiscal year, present to the tax collector a written statement certified as correct by that firefighter/EMT's chief of a Waterford Volunteer Fire Company/Department, which statement shall include the name and address of the firefighter/EMT, and that the firefighter/EMT has been determined eligible for this abatement program. Eligibility for this abatement program will only be made available to firefighters/EMT's who are not delinquent as of the May 1st due date on any financial obligations (i.e., taxes, sewer use or assessment) to the Town of Waterford and who does not share property ownership with anyone who is delinquent on any financial obligation to the Town of Waterford. A volunteer firefighter/EMT's level of participation in the program will be determined by the number of fires/EMT calls attended during the immediately preceding calendar year expressed as a percentage of the total number of calls of the department with the lowest number of calls dispatched. The total number of calls required for each level of eligibility will be established annually by the director of fire services. Thereafter the eligibility shall be computed based on the total number of calls throughout the calendar year. In cases where a firefighter/EMT has responded to a call as to which a department other than his/her own has been dispatched, in calculating the percentage of calls attended for that firefighter/EMT, the attendance shall be treated as if it were attendance at a call to which the firefighter/EMT's own department had been dispatched, and the number of calls to which the firefighter/EMT's department has been dispatched shall, as to him/her, be increased by the same number. Years of service shall not be deemed to have been interrupted by department medical leave, by military service with the United States, or by injury where worker's compensation is received. When a person has served as a volunteer firefighter/EMT and left such service, and then returned to volunteer firefighting/EMT duty, the person shall not be eligible for the tax abatement until he or she has completed one full calendar year of service. All issues or appeals between the EMT/volunteer firefighter regarding eligibility as well as level of eligibility must be resolved prior to March 1st of the year the abatement is sought. 
D.  Computation of the abatement. The property taxes of each eligible volunteer firefighter/EMT of the Waterford Volunteer Fire Companies/Department (Jordan, Quaker Hill, Goshen, Oswegatchie, Cohanzie) and the Waterford Ambulance Service shall be entitled to an abatement against real and/or regular (not supplemental) motor vehicle property tax bills owed to the Town of Waterford by such firefighter/EMT. The abatement will be at different levels established by this section as either fifteen percent, twenty percent, twenty-five percent, and thirty percent, depending upon the participation level attained by eligible volunteers. Each participation level will give an anticipated tax benefit as follows: 
Participation level Tax Benefit (+/-) 15% $300.00 20% 500.00 25% 750.00 30% 1,000.00  
E.  The order of application of the tax abatement shall be first against real estate tax owing to the Town of Waterford and then the remainder against regular (not supplemental) motor vehicle taxes owing to the Town of Waterford.

Chapter 3.17 - FLEET MANAGEMENT PLAN AND RESERVE ACCOUNT FUND 
Sections: 

3.17.010 - Establishment. 
    WHEREAS, The first selectman, acting pursuant to this authority under the Town Charter Section 3.2.3 is authorized to develop a capital spending plan, which is then ratified by the board of selectmen and board of finance and forwarded to the representative town meeting; 
    WHEREAS, "Capital items" include capital expenditures that exceed ten thousand dollars in cost, such as vehicles and other apparatus; 
    WHEREAS, the finance director, acting under the first selectman and board of finance, has proposed that the capital spending plan include a component entitled, "Fleet Management Plan" to properly manage the capital expenses of said vehicles and apparatus and account for those specific town funds; 
    NOW, THEREFORE, a fleet management plan and reserve account ordinance is hereby established to be known as the fleet management plan. 
(Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.020 - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to all town boards, commissions, agencies and departments, including the town board of education. 
(Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.030 - Intent of plan. 
    In recognition of the budgetary burden to maintain its fleet, the Town of Waterford shall prospectively recognize the annual costs associated with fleet replacement based upon defined life-cycle parameters and establish a segregated reserve fund to account for timely asset replacement, using a combination of proceeds derived from an equalized rate of annual appropriation complemented by residual value proceeds and fund investment income. 
    It is the intent to level the budgeting requirement of fleet replacements over an extended period of time and to that end it is recognized that the annual budget requirement will not be equal to the defined costs of replacement. The plan is structured using the full replacement value of the fleet as a base and spreading the cost over a number of years to provide a constant level of budget annually and allow the residual resale values of the replaced vehicles and the fund performance (investment income) to equalize the annual cost differentials. 
(Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.040 - Implementation. 
    The first selectman, under the authority of Charter Section 3.2.3, capital spending plan, through the town finance director, shall supervise and implement a "fleet management and 5-year capital improvement plan guideline" to effectuate the administration of the fleet management plan. 
(Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.050 - Definitions. 
    Variance. Any change that involves a substitution in equipment, change in the replacement year called for in the plan, or expenditure for a budgeted acquisition in excess of ten percent of the amount noted in the plan, or twenty-five thousand dollars, whichever is less. 
(Amend. of 2-6-17(1); Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.060 - Reserve account agreement. 
    Procedures: 
1.  The first selectman, with the advice of the finance director, will develop a funding level for the asset replacement schedule for the current year capital budget. As part of the annual capital improvement budgetary process, departments will be provided with a list of assets within its department scheduled to be replaced in the upcoming fiscal year. If the department heads have recommendations other than that defined by the plan, they must justify in writing each change to the first selectman. 
2.  During the budgetary process, once the department heads agree with the vehicles/equipment due for replacement in the budgetary period as defined by "the plan," the value of all departmental replacements is to be noted on the project consolidation form under the project name of fleet management in the current year capital budget. 
3.  The first selectman will provide the board of selectmen with a list of assets due for replacement in that fiscal year (the "plan") together with a summarization of the departmental requests and put forth a recommendation on the funding level of fleet management in the current year capital budget. This recommendation will be calculated by using an average of the next seven years' funding requirements. This level of budget will remain constant throughout that period only if the plan is not amended to eliminate or increase the number of assets from the prior year. 
4.  Any town official or board who/which seeks to challenge the first selectman's asset replacement list shall bring their challenges directly to the board of selectman for its consideration as part of its recommendation to the board of finance for current year capital budget. Moreover, all town boards, commissions, and officials may appeal the plan's total budget before the RTM at its annual budget meeting each fiscal year. 
5.  The board of finance through its budget review process will make a recommendation to the representative town meeting on the first selectman's fleet management plan, as part of the current year capital budget. 
6.  The board of finance can recommend approval of the first selectman's plan or return the fleet management plan to the board of selectmen with a zero dollar recommendation for the board of selectmen to reconsider the plan as a whole or to reconsider the appropriation originally put forth by the board of selectmen. 
7.  The representative town meeting will take final appropriation action. 
8.  In the event of a variance requested by a department after the budget process has been completed, the first selectman shall commence a meeting of the fleet management ad hoc committee, consisting of the first selectman or his/her designee, RTM moderator or designee, board of finance chairperson or designee, and finance director to consider the plan variance request. A quorum of three-fourths of the committee is required for business to be transacted. A unanimous vote of the committee present and voting is required for any fleet plan variance to be approved. It is recognized that the process is not static and priorities will change due to service outsourcing, downsizing or technology advancements. 
9.  If an emergency requiring a mid-year replacement outside the defined schedule should occur (i.e., replacement of a vehicle damaged in an accident), the department head shall request a meeting of the fleet management ad hoc committee to determine if such vehicle will be replaced out of cycle. The committee shall report to the board of finance on any approvals granted through this process. 
(Amend. of 2-6-17(1); Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.070 - Fleet management reserve fund. 
    The Town of Waterford will maintain a segregated account entitled, "fleet management reserve fund" and all assets maintained in this account shall be invested in a manner to satisfy the anticipated liquidity needs to replace assets. Any assets being held in reserve beyond that required for current year replacements, may be invested in securities or other appropriate instruments in which liquidity is not a consideration in order to maximize investment earnings. All investment earnings shall be redeposited in the account for the purpose of offsetting the expense of providing fleet replacement funds. 
    The major source of funding will be provided through an annual operating transfer in from the current year capital fleet management line item. 
    Residual values from sale of replaced equipment shall also be deposited into this account for the purpose of offsetting the expense of providing fleet replacement funds. The fund may also accept revenue from other sources such as rental of equipment or vehicles, grants, gifts or donations. 
    Funds may be expended from the fleet management reserve fund if they have previously been appropriated by the representative town meeting or an exception from the fleet management plan has been approved by the board of finance expenditure authorization committee. 
    An annual reconciliation/accounting shall be completed by the finance department and subject to audit to verify the expenses of the account. 
(Amend. of 6-1-09) 
3.17.080 - Effective date. 
    This chapter shall take effect fifteen days from date of passage, and shall remain in effect until otherwise amended, pursuant to Section 3.1.13 of the Waterford Charter.

Such minimum square shall not include the required yard areas and at least 80% of the minimum square area shall contain suitable soil conditions and topography for the development of the type of structure proposed as determined by the Commission. All residential structures shall be located entirely within such designated minimum square.
3.14.6 A yard equal to the minimum side yard requirement for the district in which the lot is located shall be required at all lot lines.
3.14.7 The lots shall be large enough to adequately accommodate the sanitary disposal field required by the State Health Code, or the proposed buildings shall be connected to the municipal sewer system.

a. The unaccepted street was in existence and in regular use prior to June 19, 1972, and is shown on the zoning map dated January, 1971.
b. Such action shall be in harmony with the general purposes and the intent of the Zoning Regulations and the Subdivision Regulations of the Town, as determined by the Commission.
c. Such a request shall originate with the property owner(s) whose land abuts the unaccepted street, and the property owner(s) shall present a plan and profile, prepared by a licensed Professional Engineer and/or Land Surveyor licensed by the State of Connecticut, as provided by State Law, indicating that such unaccepted street is to be improved in accordance with the provisions of item (e) herein. Said land owner(s) shall also provide quit claim deeds to the Town for that portion of the private right-of-way passing in front of their property(ies) required to accomplish such improvements.
d. The entire costs of all improvements shown on the plan submitted in accordance with item (e) herein shall be borne by the abutting land owner(s).
e. All unaccepted streets being utilized under the provisions of this Section 3.15 shall be improved in accordance with all requirements of Section 5.6 of the Town's Subdivision Regulations.

3.15.3 In no instance shall any provision of this Section 3.15 prevent the issuance of a zoning permit for the construction of any farm or accessory buildings on such property, provided such construction complies with all provisions of the Town's Zoning Regulations and the State Building Code.

3.17 AGE RESTRICTED HOUSING (Effective October 1, 2000)
3.17.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The following regulations are established to promote the development of housing for older persons (age 55 or older) within a common interest community. The development of housing projects to meet the specialized needs of this age group shall be designed in a manner that is sympathetic to the surrounding neighborhood and sensitive of the ability of the site and infrastructure to accommodate the project. These regulations provide for increased design efficiency and acknowledge that impacts on infrastructure are less with this age group than would be expected in an unrestricted housing development.
Age Restricted Housing projects may be allowed in the R-20, R-40, and developed in RU-120 Zoning districts subject to the approval of a special permit in accordance with Section 23 of these Zoning Regulations and Subdivision as applicable and subject to the additional provisions of Section 3.17.6.3 with respect to development of such housing in the RU-120 Zone. The Commission recognizes that some Age Restricted developments are likely to be complex and/or built in phases. Therefore in the alternative application for Master Plan approval for the entire site at a scale of 1 = 100 feet is permissible.
3.17.2 APPLICATION
All applications for Age Restricted Housing submitted under the provisions of 3.17 herein shall be considered as an application for a Special Permit in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Waterford. Should any provision of this Section 3.17 be in conflict with any provisions of said Regulations, then the provisions of Section 3.17 shall apply.
3.17.3 CONTENT OF THE APPLICATION
Such application shall include the following:
3.17.3.1 Application for Approval of a Special Permit (16 copies).
3.17.3.2 Site Plan:
A site plan shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 22.3 of these Regulations, except because of the probable size and complex nature of the site involved, such plan may be drawn at a scale of not less than 100 feet to the inch and may, in lieu of the requirements of Section 22.4.4g4, g.6, g.8 merely show schematically the proposed methods of storm water drainage, water supply and sanitary sewage disposal (16 copies). However, in environmentally sensitive areas, the applicant must provide in reasonable detail a storm drainage plan which addresses flooding impacts and water quality.
3.17.3.3 A conceptual plan showing typical landscaping shall be incorporated into the design and where feasible existing vegetation shall be preserved. The proposed Master Plan shall include a 40 foot landscaped buffer along any property line which defines the external boundary of the Age Restricted Housing development. The commission may require additional setbacks, landscaping or screening between buildings and accessory buildings and uses, natural resources and the adjacent properties.
3.17.3.4.1 In addition the intended general architectural design of the homes and accessory buildings within the development, including typical floor plans and building elevations drawn to scale showing the exterior materials and treatment to be used, shall be submitted as part of the development application and may be modified by the Commission. The Commission recognizes that the actual homes and site design may
vary due to market and site conditions, but the intent is that the development be constructed substantially in accordance with the plans approved by the Commission and these Regulations, as may be modified by the conditions which the Commission attaches to the approval.
3.17.3.5 In addition to other site plan requirements of Section 22, the applicant should submit as part of this application a separate site resource plan drawn to scale that identifies:
a) All non-buildable areas by type i.e.:
1) Areas with topography greater than 25% slope in grade exceeding a vertical heights of 10 as measured across the steepest portion of the ground surface in minimum horizontal increments of 40.
2) Sanitary landfill areas.
3) Inland wetlands or watercourse soils as delineated by a detailed soil survey of the property conducted by a certified soil scientist.
4) Areas within a 100 year flood hazard area as detailed on the most recent flood insurance rate maps for the Town of Waterford (FIA-FEMA).
5) Areas with the following sensitive coastal resources: beaches, dunes, bluffs, escarpments, rocky shorefronts, and tidal wetlands.
b) Inland wetlands and watercourses upland review areas and non-encroachment areas as established by the Conservation Commission,
c) Existing vegetation on site, Exposed ledge, Hilltops, and ridges,
d) Existing paths and trails
e) Existing and Proposed utility easements, Public Roads
Said plan shall be used by the Commission and may be used by the Conservation Commission to establish areas of open space, recreation and development. This may include the preservation of, or restriction on development within, buildable areas with exposed ledge, hilltops, ridges and areas of vegetation determined to be of value for habitats, buffering or as an amenity to the design of the project.
3.17.4 PROCEDURE
In taking action on a proposed Age Restricted Housing application, the Commission shall grant approval to each of the following parts of the application.
3.17.4.1 Application for Special Permit including all data required under Sections 3.17.3.1, 3.17.3.2, 3.17.3.4, 23.4 and 23.5 herein.
3.17.4.2 Conceptual Site Plan drawings in accordance with Sections 3.17.3.2, 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.3.5 herein which shall delineate the approved design
concept described within the Special Permit approval, and will establish the maximum number of units to be built on the site. However, while such plan will substantially fix the basic parameters of the Age Restricted Housing approval, it is recognized that the final design configuration within these basic parameters might change to
some extent between that time when original submission of an Age Restricted Housing application is made and that time when final construction drawings are prepared. For instance, the location of buildings on the site may change as the Master Plan which is at a scale of 1"=100' is refined for site plan approval to a scale of 1"=40'. Such movement will be allowed so long as the dwelling unit remains within the buildable area as defined in 3.34.5 of these Regulations. In addition, all other standards as established by this Regulation including setbacks and separations between buildings must be met unless otherwise modified by the Commission. As such, the final element of this approval process will consist of a detailed site plan as described in Section 3.17.4.3 herein.
3.17.4.3 Detailed Site Plan drawings meeting all of the requirements of Section 22.4 and 22.5 of these Regulations. Such plans may be submitted subsequent to the granting of approval with regard to 3.17.4.1 and 3.17.4.2 or may be submitted in lieu of the conceptual site plan described in 3.17.4.2 herein.
3.17.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1) Deed restrictions, and/or covenants shall be provided at the time of application, in a form acceptable to the Commission. These documents will permanently bind the owner and their successors to comply with all state and federal fair housing laws and enforce the restriction that all units within such development will be permanently reserved for occupancy by persons, at least 55 years of age except that one spouse may be less than age 55. These restrictions shall run with the land and be filed in the land evidence records at the time the special permit notice and plans are filed.
2) The development shall be considered as a separate development application on a separate lot and shall comply with all provisions of the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations separate from any other use.
3) Public water and public sewer shall serve the entire development. The total number of units shall not exceed the capacity of the existing public sewer allocated for this parcel as determined by the Waterford Water Pollution Control Authority. If public sewer is not currently available directly to the project parcel, approval of an extension shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the Waterford WPCA pursuant to CGS 8-24, prior to making any application under this section. Unless otherwise provided for all costs associated with said extension, including costs to reconstruct roads, shall be paid for by the project. Said extension shall make reasonable provision for future access and tie-in by other properties within the sewer shed. Further, nothing in these Regulations shall prevent the Applicant from entering into a cost reimbursement agreement with the WPCA to recoup a reasonable share of the costs upon such future tie-ins.
4) The development may be phased as approved by the Commission for a period of up to 5 years. Thereafter the Commission may grant annual extensions not to exceed a total extension of 5 years.
5) MODIFICATIONS: As provided herein, the Commission in furtherance of the purpose of providing for age restricted housing in the Town of Waterford may grant modifications, pursuant to Section 19.1.10 of the Regulations. Such modifications shall be applied for as part of any application and the Commission
shall state in the public record its reasons for acting on the modifications applied for.
3.17.6 STANDARDS
1) The minimum area upon which an Age Restricted Housing Project may be built shall be 50 acres exclusive of any other use.
2) The development shall be designed in accordance with Section 3.34 of these Regulations. The maximum allowable density, subject to compliance with all other requirements, shall be two times the buildable area divided by the minimum lot size required in the zone in which the development is to be located except that the density in the RU-120 Zone will be determined by the underlying regulations without a density credit for age restricted housing. The building area is defined as the total site area less the non-buildable area as defined in 3.17.3.5(a) above. For purposes of this calculation buildable area within an area of a proposed public road maybe counted toward density..
3) When a parcel of land proposed for Age Restricted Housing is partially in an R-40 Zone and partially in an RU-120 Zone, Age Restricted Housing may be developed in the RU-120 Zone. However, for purposes of calculating the maximum allowable number of units for the entire site, only the buildable area as defined herein in the R-40 Zone may be used. The buildable area is defined as the total site area less the non-buildable area as defined in 3.17.3.5(a) above.

Flag lots shall only apply to single family detached home development.
3.38.2 Minimum Building Setbacks
Setbacks shall comply with the district standard and Section 3.34 requirements. Each flag lot shall contain a front and a rear yard. Where interpretations are necessary to establish compliance with current yard definitions, the Commission or its agent shall locate the front and rear yards based upon the proposed lot's relationship to abutting lands and uses, and not upon the lot's orientation to the street. Front and rear yards shall be located to promote conventional separation and orientation of buildings (reference Figure F).
3.38.3 Minimum Lot Area
The flag lot shall meet the minimum lot area requirement for the district in which the lot is located, with the exception of lots in the R-20 district, which shall be a minimum of 40,000 square feet. The area of the access strip shall not be applied towards the minimum lot area or minimum buildable area requirement. Flag lots shall comply with the minimum buildable area requirements of Section 3.34.
3.38.4 Access Strip
Each flag lot shall be served by an access strip extending from the street line to the point at which the lot achieves the minimum lot width for the district. The required access strip shall be held in singular ownership as part of the flag lot it serves, and shall be no less than 25' wide for its entire length. Access to the public street shall be taken over the access strip. No more than two access strips shall abut. Where two access strips abut, a common drive serving both lots may be required at the Commission's discretion, with a single curb cut to the street. Unless a common drive is required by the Commission, all drives shall be a minimum of 5 from the property line. Common drives and/or curb cuts may be required to protect resources, reduce traffic conflicts, and for other similar purposes. Where the Commission approves a drive to extend onto an adjacent flag lot, deeded access, maintenance, and utility easements shall be filed on the Land Evidence Records prior to the issuance of a Zoning Compliance Permit for single family home development. No single access strip shall exceed 1,200 feet in length as measured from the street line to the point at which the minimum lot width is achieved.
3.38.5 Flag Lots in Cluster Subdivisions
Flag lots may be permitted within Cluster Subdivisions, however, such flag lots shall meet the requirements of Section 3.38, not the reduced bulk standards of Section 3.16. The inclusion of flag lots in a cluster subdivision shall not increase the total number of lots permitted in the development through Section 7 of the Subdivision Regulations.
3.38.6 Driveway Standards
Driveways serving flag lots shall be a minimum of 12' wide, with a minimum of 15' vertical clearance, and paved to a minimum of 20' within the property. Where the remainder is not paved, a minimum of 6" of processed gravel base shall be provided for the remaining length of the drive. Proper provisions for storm water drainage shall be made. When necessary to assure the completion of driveways consistent with these
standards, the Commission or its agent may require a surety bond, and/or withhold issuance of Certificates of Occupancy.
3.38.7 Residential Sprinkler Requirements
Where the front building line is more than 500' from the public street where lot access is taken, as measured through the access strip, the principal residence shall be served by a residential sprinkler system in compliance with NFPA 13R, as amended. The Zoning Compliance and/or Subdivision Plan shall note this requirement.
3.39 ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (Effective 6/30/13)
Accessory dwelling units shall be permitted in R-20, R-40, RU-120, and OS zoning districts in accordance with the standards contained herein, subject to the issuance of a Special Permit in conformance with Section 23 of these Regulations.
The purpose of the accessory dwelling unit is to allow flexibility in the design and construction of accessory housing on a lot and expand housing choices within the town to accomplish the housing goals of the approved plan of preservation, conservation and development.
3.39.1 Submission Requirements
In addition to the requirements of Sections 22 & 23, the Special Permit Application shall be provided in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the standards of Section 3.39.2 and shall include at a minimum, the following information:
3.39.1.1 Required application form, completed, signed, and dated accompanied by a fee(s), in accordance with Chapter 16.08 of the Waterford Code of Ordinance (see Section 26.6).
3.39.1.2 A copy of the deed for the subject parcel.
3.39.1.3 A sworn, notarized statement from the owner that they will reside in at least one of the dwelling units as a full time occupant, or they will not rent on a temporary basis the premises of the said unit at the subject premises as a condition of maintaining the validity of the accessory dwelling unit. This statement shall be placed on the Land Evidence Records against the name of the owner and shall only be released upon removal of the accessory dwelling unit or replacement with a similar statement executed by a subsequent owner. Failure to comply with the owner occupancy requirements herein shall be deemed a violation of these regulations.
3.39.1.4 Floor plans and building elevations, drawn to scale, indicating the interior and exterior use and appearance of the accessory dwelling unit. Exterior elevations shall indicate the type and color of siding existing and proposed, and other similar features including but not limited to windows, doors, shutters, trim, roof material, porches and decks
3.39.1.5 The commission may, when it is determined that the proposed accessory dwelling unit is in close proximity to the main building, require the submission of elevations that depict the locational relationship of each
structure and size and style of the main building in relation to the size, scale, style and materials of the proposed accessory dwelling unit.
The plan shall include a calculation of floor area for the existing home and accessory dwelling unit with respect to compliance with Section 3.39.2.7.
3.39.1.6 Site plan drawn to scale in accordance with Section 22.
3.39.2 Design Standards:
3.39.2.1 The accessory dwelling unit shall be a permanent structure constructed on a concrete slab, crawl space, or basement, and shall be architecturally integrated with the main building on the lot and shall maintain the architectural style and be compatible with the appearance of the main building. The commission may waive this requirement if the applicant demonstrates the proposed architectural styles and colors are historically compatible, located and applied.
3.39.2.2 The accessory dwelling unit must be detached from the main building and there may be only one accessory dwelling unit permitted for each one family dwelling.

3.40 USES SUBJECT TO A MORATORIUM (Effective 12/31/14)
A. INTENT AND PURPOSE
The Planning and Zoning Commission has determined that the following uses have the potential to impair the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and that a temporary, limited moratorium is needed in order to properly develop restrictions and standards for the implementation of these uses. Since the prior moratorium the Commission has determined that the recent establishment of the uses noted below in surrounding communities has still not provided sufficient time for the Commission to make a determination as to the potential impacts they may have upon the Town; therefore the Commission has determined that a limited extension to said moratorium is necessary to allow for additional review of the below uses and their applicability to one or more zoning districts.
B. IDENTIFIED USES SUBJECT TO MORATORIUM
1. Medical Marijuana Dispensary Facility
2. Medical Marijuana Production Facility
C. APPLICATION
1. No application for a medical marijuana dispensary or production facility and no installation or creation of a medical marijuana dispensary or production facility shall be permitted in any zone within the Town of Waterford during the effective dates specified in Sec. 3.40.D.1
D. EFFECTIVE DATE and EXPIRATION

SECTION 6A - VILLAGE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (VR)
(Amended 10/25/82, Effective 12/1/82)
6A.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of the Village Density Residential District is to preserve the existing character of a village, permit infill development consistent with the existing density and character of a village, and prevent villages from being non-conforming under the R-20 zone. A goal of the Towns Plan of Development is to foster the preservation of the strong village identities which currently exist throughout the community. Thus, the Commission declares that it is in the public interest to insure that the distinctive character of a village should not be injuriously affected and that the scale of a village be maintained.
The criteria for classifying a community as a village residential district are as follows:
1. A village is a stable residential area, generally composed of lots smaller than the 20,000 square feet minimum required in the R-20 zone.
2. A village functions as an entity.
3. A village has an existing, identifiable character which distinguishes it from surrounding development, resulting from one or more factors including:
a. common density
b. similar building ages, sizes, and/or styles
c. geographic features, including water, topography, and man-made barriers.
d. street system
e. historic identification
4. A village was generally developed before the present zoning regulations were enacted.
5. A village does not contain large tracts of undeveloped land.
6A.2 DESIGN OBJECTIVES
All development within the Village Density Residential Zone must be consistent with the following objectives:
1. The pattern of development in these areas must be consistent with the present pattern of development and with the Plan of Development.
2. The character and quality of existing village is to be maintained; structural rehabilitation is to be encouraged, and the scale of the new development should be compatible with the existing buildings.
3. No high intensity use or uses inconsistent with the residential character of these areas are to be permitted or be allowed to infringe on these villages.
4. Architectural and site design which promote aesthetic qualities while sustaining and enhancing the unique qualities of the Village are required, and shall be incorporated in all applications for permits. The Zoning Official may refer an application, which in his/her opinion is inconsistent with these regulations to the Planning and Zoning Commission for action as a site plan. (Effective 8/1/02)
5. Due to the limited lot sizes permitted, proximity to coastal waters, and potential impacts on water quality resulting from sewage discharges, each lot shall be served by public water and sewer. (Effective Date: 11/28/88)
6A.3 MINIMUM LOT SIZE
The minimum lot size of a village density residential district varies and is a function of the character of the village. Minimum lot sizes are subject to compliance with the lot design standards of Section 3.34 of these
regulations. The subscript following the VR designation (on the zoning map) indicates the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet. (Amended 7/2/90, Effective 7/13/90)

The Medical Campus Overlay District (MCOD) is an overlay zoning district located in the area south of Interstate 95, west of the boundary of the R-20 Zoning District adjacent to Cross Road, north of 429 to 475 Boston Post Road, and east of the boundary of the existing IP-1 Zoning District. The MCOD is located in an area where a range of business, industrial, and residential land uses are permitted in close proximity to interstate highways and frontage roads. The purpose of the MCOD is to enable a site with at least 40 contiguous acres to be developed into a Medical Campus as defined in Section 1.59.
13a.2 ADDITIONAL USES PERMITTED IN THE MCOD SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF A SPECIAL PERMIT
Within the MCOD, all uses allowed in the underlying zone district(s) are permitted, subject to the requirements contained in the respective underlying zone district(s). In addition, Medical Campuses may be permitted in the MCOD, if approved by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section and sections 19 and 23 of these regulations. Unless otherwise specified herein, Medical Campuses shall comply with the requirements of Section 13 (IP-1 Zoning District).
13a.2.1 The primary use(s) within a Medical Campus shall be one or more of the following uses: Hospital, Medical Clinic, Medical Services Laboratories and/or Professional Offices primarily serving as Medical and Dental Offices as defined in section 1 and the standards of section 20.3. Hereafter these uses will be collectively referred to as the "Primary Medical Use(s)."
13a.2.2 It is presumed that the following uses serving the needs of patients, clients and employees of a Medical Campus are incidental to a Primary Medical Use and thus shall be considered part of the Primary Medical Use portion of a Medical Campus: food service, personal service, retail sales including pharmacy, educational institutions or facilities with a primary emphasis on medicine or health care, personal fitness and recreation, child and adult day care, on call sleeping accommodations and other similar uses as found acceptable by the Commission. The determination of the extent to which such uses shall be considered part of the Primary Medical Use(s) shall be based on square footage proposed as well as population to be served and may be limited by the Commission to an overall percentage of the gross floor area of the building.
13a.2.2.1 Medical Marijuana Dispensary Facility: (Amended 5/31/2015)
a) Only one such facility shall be allowed on one lot,
b) The facility shall be no larger than 2,000 square feet of gross floor area,
c) The facility shall be separated from another dispensary facility by a distance 1,000 feet measured from property line to property line,
d) The facility shall not be located within 1,500 feet of any establishment that holds a liquor license of any type, package store, restaurant, hotel, inn, tavern,
e) The facility shall not be located any closer than 500 feet to a property line or residential zone district boundary line, as measured from the closest pointy of the facility to the closest property line.
f) The facility shall not be located within 1,500 feet to a property line of any school, church, public place of worship, or library. In determining compliance with these provisions, the controlling distance shall be the
shortest distance between those property lines of the proposed facility and those property lines of the affected facility or use.
13a.2.3 A Medical Campus shall contain at least 75,000 square feet of gross floor area dedicated to one or more Primary Medical Uses. The development of a Medical Campus may be phased, but at no time shall the constructed portion of the development contain less than 60% of its gross floor area dedicated to a Primary Medical Use.
13a.2.4 Up to 40% of the gross floor area of a Medical Campus may be dedicated to uses which are not a Primary Medical Use. Up to one-half of the gross floor area of such uses may be dedicated to one or more of the following uses not otherwise allowed in the underlying Zoning District, provided that the Commission makes a determination that said use will be supportive of the purpose and operation of the proposed Medical Campus, regardless of whether it may also become an independent destination for the public:
a. Retail stores and service establishments
b. Financial institutions
c. One-family dwellings
d. Two-family dwellings
e. Multi-family dwellings
As a condition of approving a use under this section 13a.2.4, any subsequent change in use within a Medical Campus, except to a Primary Medical Use, is subject to the issuance of a new special permit. This provision will also apply to a proposed change to a use allowed in the underlying zone which is not a Primary Medical Use to ensure that the purpose of these regulations is considered by the Commission at the time of the proposed change.
13a.3 PHASED APPLICATIONS
Notwithstanding any provisions in these regulations to the contrary, an application that proposes phased development of a Medical Campus is not required to include Detailed Site Plan drawings meeting the requirements of Section 22.4 and 22.5 of these regulations for phases of the Medical Campus beyond the initial phase proposed for development, provided that a master plan for the entire Medical Campus depicting general locations for land uses, site utility systems, drainage systems, and traffic access is submitted in conjunction with the application filed pursuant to sections 19 and 23 of these regulations. Once an application for a multiple phase Medical Campus has been approved by the Commission, all later phases of development after the initial phase must be approved pursuant to the provisions of section 19.4.3 of these regulations pertaining to Detailed Site Plan drawings.
13a.4 START OF CONSTRUCTION
Notwithstanding any provisions in these regulations to the contrary, initial construction of a Medical Campus shall be commenced within 5 years after the date of special permit approval by the Commission. For good cause shown, the Commission may grant one or more extensions of time to commence construction, not to exceed a total extension of 5 years.
SECTION 14 - WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (WD)
14.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of the Waterfront Development District is to encourage a mixture of land uses, with emphasis on waterfront access and water dependent and related uses (defined by the State of Connecticut as those uses and facilities which require direct access to, or location in, marine or tidal waters and which therefore, cannot be located inland, including but not limited to: marinas, recreational and commercial fishing and boating facilities, finfish and shellfish processing plants, waterfront dock and port facilities, shipyards and boat facilities, navigation aids, basins and channels, industrial uses dependent upon waterborne transportation or requiring large volumes of cooling or process water which cannot reasonably be located or operated at an inland site and uses which provide general public access to marine or tidal waters).
The Town of Waterford contains a number of valuable waterfront areas, which have potential for waterfront development. These areas include several of the Thames River peninsulas and portions of the Mago Point area on the Niantic River. The Waterfront Development District is designed to achieve the most appropriate use of land and structures in these waterfront areas consistent with the design guidelines included here and in special plans adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission for Mago Point or any of the designated Thames River peninsulas.

SECTION 18A - ADAPTIVE REUSE DEVELOPMENT FOR MULTIFAMILY OR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT (Effective 9/1/2014)
PURPOSE:
The intent of Adaptive Reuse Development is to allow flexibility in development to promote the renovation, reuse of existing structures or support future or past environmental remediation of sites that are no longer viable for their original intended use as a result of aging building infrastructure, arrangement of building patterns and floor plan, evolving economic market dynamics, environmental contamination or condemnation. It is recognized that the promotion of the Adaptive Reuse of Underutilized Buildings and sites classified as Brownfields, reducing the demand on building resources and is vital to protecting undeveloped landscapes, protecting the unnecessary expansion of infrastructure, and focusing redevelopment in already developed areas which support traffic and utility infrastructure.
18A.1 GENERAL
Each application for an Adaptive Reuse Development shall require a plan review with a special permit as provided for in Section 23 of these Regulations. Each application shall be acted upon by the Commission acting in its capacity as Zoning Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-3(c) of the Connecticut General Statutes as may be amended. The Commission, at the applicants expense, may hire a third party to review submitted material, testimony or other information deemed necessary for the Commission to render a decision.
18A.2 USES ALLOWED IN ADAPTIVE REUSE DEVELOPMENT
All uses specified below are subject to plan review and special permit as provided in Section 23 of these regulations.
18A.2.1 R-20 and R-40 districts: Multi-Family Dwellings
18A.2.2 VR, NB, NBPO, or a Village District that has been established under the Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-2j zoning district
a. Mixed Use Development subject to the following provisions:
a. The uses allowed in a Mixed Use Development shall include the permitted uses in the underlying zone, as may be amended from time to time.
b. Multi-family development is permitted by special permit only when no less than 25% of the gross floor area of all buildings associated with the parcel is designated for a use other than residential dwelling.
c. In VR, NB and NBPO districts, no residential dwelling units shall be allowed on the first floor.
18A.3 LOCATION ELIGIBILITY
18A.3.1 In order for a property to be redeveloped as an Adaptive Reuse Development as defined by Section 1 of these regulations, the Commission shall determine the property meets Adaptive Reuse Eligibility Criteria. This determination shall be made in conjunction with the procedures of a site plan and special permit Application. In making their findings under a special permit for Adaptive Reuse Development, the Commission shall base their decision upon the criteria specifically described in Section 23 of these Regulations and the following Adaptive Reuse Development Eligibility Criteria
a. The property shall be entirely located within an R-20, R-40, VR, NB, NBPO or a Village District that has been established under the CGS 8-2j zoning district.
b. Except as otherwise provided, the property shall have frontage upon Rope Ferry Road and be located between the easterly side of the intersection of Rope Ferry Road and Gardiners Woods Road and the westerly side of the intersection of Rope Ferry Road
and Great Neck Road.
c. The property shall be connected to both public sewer and water with demonstrated capacity to support the intended use as determined by a licensed professional engineer and confirmed by the Waterford Utility Commission.
d. The property shall have adequate transportation infrastructure or the applicant shall demonstrate that improvements can be made that will accommodate future traffic generation.
e. The property shall have a building that is fifty (50) years or older at the date of the adoption of this Adaptive Reuse Regulation.
18A.3.2 At the time of making the determination that the location is eligible, the Commission shall also make the determination that the site meets at least one of the following:
a. Is a Historic Building as defined in Section 1 of these Regulations. A site that contains a state or national listed structure and is located within 500 of Rope Ferry Road but does not have frontage on said roadways may be eligible for an Adaptive Reuse Development.
b. Is determined by the Commission to meet the definition of an Underutilized Building.
c. Is on a site that is classified or was classified as a Brownfield.
18A.4 STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS
18A.4.1 Each proposal for an Adaptive Reuse Development submitted under the provisions of Section 18.3 herein shall meet each of the following standards and conditions.
18A.4.2 Building Reuse and Demolition: Underutilized Buildings may be demolished and new buildings erected to accommodate the intended purpose of this regulation only if:
a. More than 50% of the total of all building area has been condemned by the Building Official; or
b. Substantial evidence is provided that the buildings physical condition cannot support a viable use as a result of floor plan configuration or costs to renovate; in making such a determination, the Commission shall review evidence submitted by the applicant to support such a decision. This shall include the certification from a Structural Engineer as to the extent of the costs of the renovation necessary to create a viable use.
c. No more than 10% of an existing building to be reused will be demolished. However, if the site is classified as a Brownfield, all buildings may be demolished and new structures constructed.
18A.4.3 Setbacks: Unless existing setbacks are legal, non-conforming setbacks, setbacks shall conform to the underlying zone.
18A.4.4 Building Height. Building height shall conform to the underlying zone.

SECTION 19  PLANNED DESIGN DISTRICT (PDD) (Effective Date: 8/21/15)
19.1 GENERAL
19.1.1 The Commission recognizes that there exists properties located in commercial, industrial or multi-family districts, along with adjacent land in residentially zoned districts, which present unique opportunities to encourage the development of coherent and related groups of buildings and uses. These same properties can be developed or redeveloped in a manner to promote creativity and superior design through flexible and context-sensitive design standards, support significant economic investment, and reduce impacts associated with large-scale development. Moreover, these sites offer prospects to foster sustainable and environmentally responsible development and provide protection to adjoining neighborhoods in a manner consistent with policies, goals, and objectives outlined within the Plan of Conservation and Development (POCD), as amended. Accordingly, the Commission hereby creates the Planned Design District (PDD) to provide an alternative to the traditional development of these properties under their existing zoning designation.
19.1.2 The approval of a PDD constitutes a change in zone and will be a floating zone governed by a Master Design Plan in accordance with these regulations. Any substantial or material change to an approved Master Design Plan, as defined herein, shall be subject to the same review and public hearing procedures as the original zone change. Once enacted, the PDD will supersede all pre-existing zoning, and any development on the rezoned property will be subject to the approved Master Design Plan and these PDD regulations.
19.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT
19.2.1 The Commission shall establish the PDD by approving a Master Design Plan, which while not intended to be a substitute for detailed documentation associated with a site plan, provides sufficient information to determine whether the proposal is in conformance with the purpose of the PDD and is consistent with the POCD. Such adoption shall constitute a zoning map amendment in accordance with Section 28 of these Regulations.
19.2.2 Additions and Alterations. Any addition or alteration to the Master Design Plan must conform with the purpose of the PDD and remain consistent with the POCD. Furthermore, any addition or alteration, which, in the discretion of the Commission, constitutes a substantial or material change, shall be subject to the same review and public hearing procedures as the original zone change. A substantial or material change shall include, but shall not be limited to, any revision, extension, enlargement, movement or other change in the proposed development of the site which results in increasing the total amount of approved coverage by more than 25%, increasing the total approved height of any building by more than 20%, reducing the approved relationship between the amount of building area and the amount of parking to be provided, reducing the total amount of approved landscaped area by more than 10%, locating any building closer to an adjacent property or street line than that which is approved, or reducing the size of or changing in any way the location of any approved intersection or driveway connection with a public street.
19.2.3 District Eligibility. To be eligible for the PDD designation a site must: (1) encompass one or more contiguous parcels of land totaling four (4) acres or more in gross area; (2) have the ability to connect to a public water supply and municipal sanitary sewer; and (3) be 1ocated in a commercial, industrial, or multi-family district or may include residentially zoned land that is adjacent to said commercial, industrial, or multi-family district provided that the amount of residentially zoned land does not exceed 25% of the total area of the proposed PDD.
19.2.4 Numbering of Districts. Each PDD shall be numbered and depicted sequentially on the most recently adopted Town of Waterford Zone District Map in accordance with the date of adoption (i.e. PDD-1, PDD-2, PDD-3, and so forth).
19.3 MASTER DESIGN PLAN SUBMISSION

Requests for such waivers shall be submitted to the Commission and shall include all information required in section 21.7b, an application fee of $50.00, and a narrative explaining the proposals compliance with these standards and criteria. In approving such signs, the Commission shall state upon the record its reasons for approval, and may establish conditions and stipulations regarding, existing or future signs, including those allowed as of right.
STANDARDS AND CRITERIA
1. The signs shall comply with all other provisions of these regulations. The area of any such building mounted sign shall not exceed the maximum area permitted for the building wall below said sign, and shall be included in the total sign area permitted for that building wall. Only one roof mounted sign may be permitted per building.
2. Any roof mounted sign shall not extend above the ridgeline of a pitched roof, or more than three feet above the roofline of a flat roof, unless mounted upon a parapet or similar architectural feature, designed as an integral part of the building itself, and approved by the Commission. Roof top signs shall be placed parallel to the ridgeline and the bottom of any such sign shall be no more than 1 foot from the roof surface. Roof signs shall be constructed so as to conceal all structure and fastenings.
3. The applicant shall demonstrate that the need to increase the size or place the sign on the roof, or to increase the height of a freestanding sign as permitted herein is due to a physical limitation relating specifically to the visibility of the use as viewed from the closest arterial and/or collector street.
21.9 MEASUREMENT OF SIGN AREA

b. The support for a sign, whether it be columns, a pylon, or a building or part thereof, shall not be included in the computation of total sign area, except in the case of free- standing signs where such supporting member or members, when viewed from a point directly in front of the sign area, covers an area exceeding 25% of the total sign area supported. When supporting members of a sign exceed this 25% limitation, they shall be computed as part of the allowable sign area.
21.10 ILLUMINATION
All signs shall meet the following requirements as pertain to illumination:
a. A sign may be illuminated only if the illumination is confined to or directed upon the surface of the sign only. The light from or directed upon any illuminated sign shall be shaded, shielded or directed in such a way as to assure that the light intensity or brightness therefrom shall not be directed upon any public thoroughfare, highway, sidewalk or property other than that on which the sign is located.
b. No sign shall be illuminated by or contain flashing, fluttering, blinking intermittent, rotating, or moving light or lights, nor shall any sign be illuminated by a light source which does not maintain a constant intensity, brightness or color, except signs indicating time and/or temperature by means of white intermittent lighting.
c. No colored lights shall be used at any location or in any manner so as to be confused with or construed as traffic control devices or marine navigational devices.
d. Neither the direct, or reflected light from primary light sources shall create a traffic hazard to operators of motor vehicles on public thoroughfares.

SECTION 22a -INFORMAL STAFF MEETINGS AND PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW
22a.1 PURPOSE
Applicants are encouraged to request informal staff meetings and a preliminary staff review for special permit, site plan, zone change, regulation amendment and other administrative approvals. The objective of informal staff meetings and preliminary staff review is not to evaluate detailed site plan applications. The intent is to allow town staff to assist an applicant in understanding town requirements for formal applications based upon a single proposed development program. To assist the applicant in making site plan and special permit applications the outcome of informal staff meetings and preliminary staff review will attempt to address the following:
a) Review the zoning district(s) the subject property resides within
b) Determine the appropriate type of land use classification
c) Based upon land use, provide direction for the type of permit application(s) required
d) Provide direction to applying appropriate sections of the regulations (i.e. bulk standards, parking, landscaping, lot design, etc.)
e) Review conceptual design of site layout, grading, stormwater management and building design to provide general direction associated with applying applicable regulations to the proposed application
In addition, an applicant may request a pre-application review meeting with the Commission. The purpose of a pre-application is to introduce a plan or use and receive non-binding input from the Commission. This may be beneficial for both the Commission and applicant, particularly for more complex or unique development scenarios.
Participation in any of the above and the level of review provided is at the discretion of the Commission or its Agent.
At anytime there is a discrepancy in interpreting the zoning regulations between the applicant and staff or Commission, the applicant has the right to request an interpretation of any part of these zoning regulations from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
22a.2 PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW FOR USE OF PROPERTY AND RIGHT TO FILE APPLICATION
All Pre-application Review procedures are subject to the provisions of CGS Sec. 7-159b.
The applicant has the right to file a formal application at anytime.
22a.3 INFORMAL STAFF MEETING(S)
Informal staff meeting(s), separate from a Commission Pre-application Review Meeting, can be requested. The nature of the application will determine the extent of a particular town departments involvement. At minimum, this will include planning and zoning staff.
Informal staff meetings may continue at the discretion of town staff.
22a.4 PRELIMINARY STAFF REVIEW
In addition to informal staff meeting(s) the applicant may request town staff to conduct one (1) preliminary review of the application. Conducting the preliminary review and the content of its submission is at the discretion of the Commissions agent. This review shall occur prior to a Commission Pre-application Meeting, if applicable. Staff will review the submitted information and provide written comments to the applicant. Additional comments from staff during the formal application review should be anticipated.
For Preliminary Staff Review, submission of detailed plans and reports (i.e. grading and drainage plans, erosion and sedimentation control, traffic reports, drainage calculations, etc.) are discouraged. Material should be conceptual in nature but clearly represent the intent and nature of the use. An example of submission materials for an informal staff review may include the following:

SECTION 23 - SPECIAL PERMITS WITH DESIGN REVIEW (Amended 5/1/14)
23.1 PURPOSE
The purpose and execution of a comprehensive Zoning Regulation is based upon the division of the community into zoning districts in which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or regulated so as to be uniformly permitted in a particular zoning district, without careful consideration in each case of the impact of such uses upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area; and without careful evaluation of the public need for such uses in the particular locations proposed. Such uses, therefore, shall be treated individually through the use of Special Permits, as provided in Sections 3.17, 3.18, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 6A.5, 7.2, 7A.3, 8.2, 8A.2, 9.2, 10.2, 11.2, 12.2, 13.2, 14.3, 15.2, 16.2, 17.2, 17A.2 and 19 of these regulations. Special Permits shall also be used to control height requirements under the provisions of Section 3.6; modifications to multi-family development requirements under the provisions of Section 18.7; and excavation operations under the provisions of Section 25.1 of these regulations.
23.2 APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL PERMITS WITH DESIGN REVIEW (Amended 5/1/14)
Each application for the approval of a Special Permit shall be filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer on a form provided by the Commission at least five calendar days prior to the Commissions next regularly scheduled meeting and shall be accompanied by a fee, as required by Section 23.3 herein. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not take action on any Special Permit application until after a public hearing has been held in accordance with the requirements of Section 8-3c of the Connecticut General Statutes (see appendix to these regulations).
Each Special Permit application shall include a site plan prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 22 of these regulations. The Commission may take action simultaneously on both the Special Permit application and the site plan prepared for the subject property, however, approval of a Special Permit application shall not constitute approval of the site plan for the subject site unless specifically stated by the Commission.
All Site Plans associated with a special permit are subject to the provisions and additional submission requirements of Section 22b  Design Review of Site and Building Improvements. (Effective 5/1/14)
23.3 FEE
An application fee as specified in Section 26.6 shall accompany each Special Permit application. Such fee shall be paid by check or money order payable to the order of the Town of Waterford and shall be used to defray the publication costs of the required legal notices. Such fee shall be non-refundable. Furthermore, if the actual costs of legal advertising are found to be more than the application fee, the applicant shall pay such additional money as may be required to cover all estimated legal advertising costs to the Town of Waterford prior to the Commission taking action on the applicants request.(Effective Date: July 25, 1983)
23.4 NOTIFICATION OF ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS
Each application for a Special Permit shall include a list, prepared by the applicant, of the names and addresses of the owners of all land included within the application and of all properties 150 feet or less distant therefrom, all as shown on the most recent records on file in the Town of Waterfords Tax Assessors Office (or the actual owners of record if otherwise known to the applicant). The applicant shall mail notification of said pending application to at least one owner of each such property not more than 15 days nor less than 10 days before the date set for the public hearing, by transmitting the text of the public hearing notice as provided by the Commission.
Evidence of such mailing, in the form of United States Post Office Certificates of Mailing, shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer along with the above said list of property owners, not less than five calendar days prior to the hearing date. Failure to comply with any of the procedures required herein shall be deemed valid basis for denial of a Special Permit request.
23.5 FINDINGS
A Special Permit shall not be granted until the Planning and Zoning Commission has determined that all of the following conditions and site plan requirements have been satisfied. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant, at the time an application for Special Permit is made, to provide plans and reports which describe the proposed developments conformance with the required findings of Section 23.5. Any data, plans, and reports submitted in support of an application may be made additional conditions and stipulations of approval of a Special Permit. (Effective Date 1/1/87)
23.5.1 Compliance with the Adopted Plan of Preservation, Conservation and Development
The proposed use of the subject site is consistent with the purpose and intent of the Town of Waterfords adopted Plan of Preservation, Conservation and Development. This includes but is not limited to addressing types of uses that meet the changing needs of the community and aids in long range goals of the Plan, and such proposed use is one that is specially permitted within the zoning district.
23.5.2 Orderly Development
The location, type, character and size of the use and of any building or other structure in connection therewith shall be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the town and the neighborhood and will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent property.
23.5.3 Property Values
The proposed use will not depreciate adjacent property values and the size and height of all proposed buildings and the extent of all proposed site improvements shall both be such as to harmonize with the existing character of the neighborhood in which such use is to be established.
23.5.4 Public Safety
The nature and location of the proposed use and of any building or other structure in connection therewith shall be such that there is adequate access to it for the purpose of fire protection, police protection, and other emergency equipment.
23.5.5 Traffic Considerations
The streets serving the proposed use are adequate to carry all prospective traffic; adequate provision is made for entering and leaving the subject site in such a manner that no undue hazard to traffic or undue traffic congestion shall be created; adequate off-street parking and loading facilities are provided as required by Section 20 of these regulations; and the development of the subject site provides for the continuation and appropriate improvement of streets terminating at or proposed to be constructed through the lot on which the proposed use is to be located.
23.5.6 Landscaping and Buffers
The site on which the proposed use is to be located will be suitably landscaped to protect the neighborhood and adjacent property and the proposed use of the subject property will not result in the loss of any existing buffering between the subject site and adjacent single-family residentially zoned properties. When adequate buffering is not found to exist, sufficient buffers between the proposed use and adjacent properties shall be provided.
23.5.7 Relationship to Utility Systems, Drainage Systems and Impact on Community Facilities
The subject site has adequate water and sewerage systems to service the proposed use. Adequate provision for storm water drainage can be provided without adversely affecting neighboring properties or adjacent public drainage systems, and the proposed use will not adversely impact existing community facilities.
23.5.8 Compliance with Zoning Regulations
In addition to meeting the other conditions described herein, the proposed use and the arrangement of all proposed buildings, structures, facilities and other site improvements shall comply with all applicable provisions of these Zoning Regulations.
23.5.9 Community Character, Health, and Welfare
Design of buildings and sites has an effect upon the community character and health, safety and welfare of the residents and visitors of the Town. The nature and location of the proposed use, supporting infrastructure, building design and placement, use of dissimilar or excessive uniformity of materials, inappropriate application of architectural styles, spaces between buildings, circulation patterns, signs, lighting, the arrangement of plant material and site amenities, parking configuration and other site improvements; access to parks , recreation and open space and provisions for alternative modes of transportation, including walking and biking; and promoting physical exercise through the use of materials, patterns and textures to encourage walking shall be such that they enhance and contribute to an individuals physical and emotional well being, positively impact property values and help to define a neighborhood and the overall Town character.
23.6 PERMITTED STIPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL PERMIT
The Commission, in approving a Special Permit, may stipulate such restrictions as appear to the Commission to be reasonable to protect or promote the rights of individuals, property values and the environment in the area as a whole, the public health, safety or welfare, sound planning and zoning principles, improved land use, site planning and land development, or better overall neighborhood compatibility. Such restrictions may concern, without limitation, the components of the site plan; building location, size and layout; distribution of and relationship between uses and structures; vehicular and pedestrian circulation; parking; open space; landscaping and screening; signs and lighting; and the design and architectural treatment of all structures.
23.7 SUBSTANTIAL CONSTRUCTION WITHIN ONE YEAR
If substantial construction has not begun on a building or structure, or no use has been established on a lot for which a Special Permit was approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, within one year from the date of issuance of such Special Permit for said building, structure or use, such Special Permit shall become null and void. Substantial construction shall include the erection of all foundation structures and at grade slabs.
However, in its discretion, and for good cause, the Planning and Zoning Commission, upon request of the applicant, may extend for an additional one year the period for the beginning of substantial construction or establishment of a use, provided such extension shall be granted only once for any particular Special Permit.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may also, at its discretion and for good cause, upon request of the applicant, approve a staging timetable for the start of construction or the establishment of a use, provided that such a staging timetable shall include all portions of the proposed development, and the approval of such staging program shall take precedence over other provisions established herein.
23.8 REVOCATION OF SPECIAL PERMITS
Whenever the Commission shall find, in the case of any Special Permit hereafter granted pursuant to the provisions of this section, that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such approval was granted are not being complied with, the Commission may rescind and revoke such approval after giving due notice to the owner of record of the property involved and the applicant for said Special Permit. Furthermore, whenever a use permitted by a Special Permit is abandoned, as defined in Section 24.2.6 of these regulations, the approval of such permit shall be rescinded and revoked. Continuation of a use for
which a Special Permit approval has been rescinded and revoked shall constitute a violation of these Zoning Regulations.
23.9 CHANGES REGARDING APPROVED SPECIAL PERMITS
The following provisions shall govern any proposed changes regarding an approved Special Permit:
23.9.1 Once a Special Permit has been granted to use a lot under the provisions of Section 3.17, 3.18, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 6A.5, 7.2, 7A.3, 8.2, 8A.2, 9.2, 10.2, 11.2, 12.2, 13.2, 14.3, 15.2, 16.2, 17.2 or 17A.2 of these regulations, and a site plan regarding such use has been approved under the provisions of Section 22 of these regulations, no subsequent change to the approved building or structure, parking lot, sign or outdoor use of land shall be permitted unless a new site plan is submitted to and approved by the Commission regarding such change.
If any such modification involves a change in the use of the property or buildings thereon, from that which was originally approved, a new Special Permit application delineating such change in use shall be submitted to and approved by the Commission. In interpreting the provisions of this section, the mere expansion of an approved use into additional space shall not be considered a change of use.
23.9.2 Except as provided herein, no requirement modified under the provisions of Section 3.6 or 18.7 of these regulations shall be modified in any way unless a new Special Permit application has been submitted to and approved by the Commission regarding such modification. However, no new Special Permit application shall be required if a property owner chooses to comply with the requirements of any provisions for which a modification was approved.
23.9.3 When any Special Permit is granted under the provisions of Section 25.1 of these regulations, no change in the scope of operations or conditions of the approved site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Commission regarding such change.
SECTION 24 - NON-CONFORMING USES, LOTS AND STRUCTURES
24.1 GENERAL
A non-conforming use, lot or structure is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, prior to the date these regulations or any amendment thereto became effective, and which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable requirements of these regulations or any amendment thereto.
24.2 NON-CONFORMING USES
For the purpose of these regulations, a non-conforming use shall be defined as a use of land and/or buildings which lawfully existed prior to the enactment of the Zoning Regulations or any amendment thereto, which does not comply with the use restrictions applicable to the district in which it is situated, and which is continuously maintained after the effective date of such enactment.
24.2.1 No non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, extended or altered except in changing the use to one which is permitted in the District in which such use is located. No non-conforming use of an existing structure shall be extended to occupy land outside such structure or space in another structure.
24.2.2 No non-conforming use of land shall be moved to another part of a lot or outside the lot, and no non-conforming use of a structure shall be moved to any part of the structure not manifestly arranged and designed for such use at the time the use became non-conforming, and no structure containing a non-conforming use shall be moved, unless the result of such move is to end the non-conforming use.
24.2.3 Non non-conforming use of land or of a structure shall be changed to any use which is substantially different in nature and purpose from the former non-conforming use, except such uses as are permitted in the district in which they are located.
24.2.4 When a non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not hereafter be changed to any use not permitted in the district in which the use is located.
24.2.5 Any non-conforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be reestablished. Any structure or land, or structure and land in combination, which has been abandoned, shall not again be devoted to any use other than those uses which are permitted in the district in which the structure or land, or structure and land in combination, is located.
24.2.6 The term abandonment, as used herein, shall mean the voluntary discontinuance of a use, when accompanied by an intent not to reestablish such use. Any of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon:
a. Any positive act indicating such intent; or
b. In the case of a structure or of a structure and land in combination, discontinuance of the non-conforming use for 12 consecutive months or for a total of 18months during any three-year period;
c. In the case of land only, discontinuance of the non-conforming use for 90 consecutive days, or for a total of six months during any one-year period.
24.2.7 For the purpose of these regulations, failure to meet the required parking or loading requirements, failure to provide required buffer areas, and/or failure to provide adequate landscaping as required by these regulations shall be deemed to constitute a non-conforming use. However, nothing in these regulations shall prohibit a property owner from improving his property in such a way as to eliminate such non-conformity.
24.3 NON-CONFORMING LOTS
For the purpose of these regulations, a non-conforming lot shall be defined as a lot which had a separate existence prior to the enactment of those zoning regulations, or any amendment thereto which required a larger area, frontage, width or depth that that which existed prior to such enactment.
24.3.1 In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of these regulations, single-family dwellings and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any non-conforming lot which was in separate ownership and not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership as evidenced by a deed recorded in the Land Records of the Town of Waterford prior to the effective date of adoption of these regulations, or any amendments thereto which created such non-conforming lot, provided that construction on and use of each such lot shall comply with all other provisions of these regulations.

No portion of said undivided lot shall be used or sold as a building lot which does not meet lot frontage, width and area requirements established within these regulations, nor shall any division of a lot be made which leaves any remaining lot with frontage, width or area below the requirements stated within these regulations.
24.3.3 Where two or more lots or combinations of lots or portions of lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership as described in Section 24.3.2 herein and a lawfully erected building containing a primary use is located on such lot or lots, such lots shall be combined in such a way that each primary use is located on a conforming lot and in no case shall any lot be so created or maintained which is non-conforming in area, width, or frontage.
24.3.4 If any non-conforming lot contains an existing conforming use within an existing structure, permitted accessory uses may be erected and any existing structure may be modified, altered, or expanded so long as all new construction complies with all other applicable requirements of these regulations.
24.3.5 However, no requirement contained within this Section 24.3 shall supercede the provisions of Sections 8-26a, 8-28a and 8-28b of the Connecticut State Statutes.
24.4 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES (Effective 12/1/02)
For the purpose of these regulations, a non-conforming structure shall be defined as a structure which existed lawfully prior to the enactment of these regulations or any amendment thereto, which does not comply with the restrictions as to size, nature of construction, location of the structure on the land, or location of the structure in proximity to other buildings required by the regulations adopted subsequent to its construction, and which is continuously maintained after the effective date of such regulations or amendment thereto.
24.4.1 Any non-conforming structure lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations may be continued to be used, as long as such use is either permitted within the district in which it is located or is a legal non-conforming use; such structure may be expanded, modified or altered in accordance with the following provisions:
a. Such expansion, modification or alteration must not result in the expansion of a non-conforming use.
b. No increase in the area, any dimension or bulk of that portion of the structure which is non-conforming shall be permitted and all new construction shall comply with all requirements of these
regulations, except that the height of that portion of the structure in non-conformity may be increased to the height permitted in the district in which the building is located.
24.4.2 In order to assure that the fair interests of all parties will be protected, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prohibit the restoration of any non-conforming structure and its use where such structure has been destroyed by means out of the control of the owner, provided the restoration of such structure and its use in no way increases any former non-conformity and provided further that restoration of such structure is begun within one year after the date of such destruction and all construction is diligently pursued to completion within two years following the date of such destruction.
24.5 MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF STRUCTURES CONTAINING NON-CONFORMING USES
In order to assure that structures containing non-conforming uses will be maintained in safe and decent condition for so long as such non-conforming uses continue, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prohibit:
24.5.1 Work to be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls, ceilings, floors, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, in the non-conforming structure or non conforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that such work does not expand or increase the extent of the non-conformity.
24.5.2 Any work required by the codes and ordinances of the Town of Waterford as ordered by any Town Official charged with protecting the public health, safety, or welfare, if such work does not enlarge or extend a non-conforming use or otherwise increase any non-conformity.
SECTION 25 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
25.1 EARTH PRODUCTS EXTRACTION, GRADING AND FILLING (Effective Date: 12/22/11)
The purpose of this section is to provide a regulation to allow land to be excavated, graded or filled on a temporary basis when the activity is not associated with an approved site plan for a building or use permitted in the Zoning District where the property is located. It is the intent of these regulations to restrict these temporary activities, due to the potential impact on the natural resources and potential to generate excessive erosion and water quality degradation. Earth products including soil, loam, topsoil, sand, gravel, clay, rock or stone may be excavated or removed from any lot and land may be regraded or filled, as a temporary use for a period not to exceed two years subject to the approval of a Special Permit in accordance with Section 23 of these Regulations and Site Plan approvals in accordance with Section 22 of these Regulations and the following restrictions
a. These regulations are not intended to permit the mining or quarrying or processing of extracted earth products as a permanent use in any Zoning District. Permanent earth product processing is prohibited, constituting a long term land disturbance, and having cumulative impacts on the environment, property values and the public welfare.
b. The Commission may grant a Special Permit for a limited period of time, not exceeding two years, if it shall find that such excavation, regrading, removal or filling will not result in the creations of any sharp declivities, pits, or depressions, land forms not in harmony with the surrounding topography, or create any drainage or sewage problems or other conditions which would impair the use of the property in accordance with the Zoning Regulations and that such excavation, regrading, removal or filling will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Regulations.
25.1.1 Exceptions
a. Excavation, removal, regrading or filling in conjunction with an approved site plan and grading plan as required in Section 22.4.3b.1 of these regulations.
b. Excavation, removal, regrading or filling in conjunction with an approved subdivision grading plan and certified soil erosion and sediment control plan.
c. Excavation, removal, regrading, or filling in conjunction with and clearly essential to the construction or alteration of a building or structure on the same premises for which a building permit, health permit, and zoning compliance permit has been issued.
d. Incidental excavation, removal, regrading or filling in connection with property maintenance or landscaping. No more than 500 cubic yards of material shall be deposited or removed from a lot, or no more than 20,000 square feet of a lots area shall be disturbed, subject to the provisions of Section 25.1.6.
e. A sanitary landfill operation of the Town of Waterford which has been approved by the Department of Environmental Protection.
f. Agricultural excavation, regrading or filling operations provided that no more than 1,000 cubic yards of materials deposited or removed.

25.2.4 No zoning permit shall be issued for any structure within the Town of Waterford if such structure is located on a lot on which inland wetlands areas or watercourses are located until the request for such permit has been referred to the Town of Waterfords Conservation Commission and they have taken action regarding the construction proposed.
25.3 DEVELOPMENT IN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS (Revised: 7/5/2011)
The flood hazard areas of Waterford are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
25.3.1 Purpose:
It is the purpose of these regulations to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: A) restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; B) require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; C) control the alternation of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; D) control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and E) prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
25.3.2 Definitions:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations its most reasonable application.

A. The provisions of these regulations shall apply to any land and improvements which are located within a flood hazard area, floodway, or coastal high hazard zone, as indicated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, which are on file in the offices of the Town Clerk and Planning & Zoning Commission.
B. These regulations shall also apply to any development which will alter the natural drainage patterns of a site so as to result in the flooding of on-site or adjacent properties, buildings, structures, utilities and other improvements, on a one percent or greater chance in any one year.
C. These regulations shall also apply to areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New London County, Connecticut, dated August 5, 2013 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated August 5, 2013 (Panels 09011C0361J, 09011C0362J, 09011C0363J, 09011C0364J, 09011C0477J, 09011C0481J, 09011C0483J, 09011C0484J, 09011C0491J, 09011C0492J, 09011C0501J, 09011C0503J, 09011C0511J) and July 18, 2011 (Panels 09011C0336G, 09011C0337G, 09011C0339G, 09011C0341G, 09011C0342G, 09011C0343G, 09011C0344G, 09011C0482G), and other supporting data applicable to the Town of Waterford, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A, AE, and VE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. The VE Zone and Coastal AE Zone bounded by a line labeled Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA) are also identified as the Coastal High Hazard Area on a FIRM. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevation (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. (Revised 8/5/13)
D. As provided in Section 26.3 of the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Waterford, a Zoning Compliance Permit shall be required in conformance with these regulations prior to the commencement of any development activities, including the issuance of any building permit for construction of any nature located within any designated Flood Hazard Area. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, used, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and other applicable regulations. In addition, no manufactured home shall be placed within any designated Flood Hazard Area in accordance with these provisions and Section 3.20 of these regulations, unless a Zoning Compliance Permit has been issued indicating that such placement meets all of the conditions of Section 25.3 herein, and all other applicable requirements of these regulations.
E. Aboveground Storage Tanks  Above ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent floatation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
F. Portion of structure in flood zone  If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
G. Structures in two flood zones  If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone, structure must be built to the highest BFE) The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks
or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
H. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water  New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility.
I. This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these regulations and another ordinance, regulation, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
J. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Waterford or upon any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
K. The Zoning Officer shall forward written notice by certified mail to the State of Connecticut Department of Water Resources, the New England Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and to abutting municipalities upstream, and downstream, and if applicable, to those otherwise impacted by any proposal to relocate or alter a watercourse. Such notice shall be made prior to final action on the permit by the commission or its agent. Failure to receive comments from the above referenced shall not restrict the commission or its agent from taking final action on the permit.
L. Federal and State Permits - All development and construction proposals for land within any designated Flood Hazard Area shall be reviewed to determine if Federal and/or State permits are required, and if such are required, no Zoning Compliance Permit shall be issued until all said permits have been obtained.
M. Administration and enforcement of these Regulations shall be done in accordance with Section 26 of these regulations.
N. All records pertaining to the provisions of these regulations shall be maintained in the office of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall obtain and maintain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor(including basement) of all new construction and substantial improvements; obtain and maintain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which all new construction and substantial improvements have been flood-proofed; and in coastal high hazard areas (VE zones and Coastal AE Zones bounded by a line labeled Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)), obtain and maintain the elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member for all new construction, substantial improvement or repair to a structure that has sustained substantial damage.(Revised 8/5/13)

H. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact boundaries of an area of special flood hazard, i-e., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as so provided in these regulations.
I. In the event base flood elevation data or floodway data has not been provided, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer the provisions of these regulations
25.3.5 Design Standards:
A. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
1. New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from Hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, and shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage and shall also be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
2. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during the conditions of flooding.
3. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges from the system into flood waters.
4. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system into flood waters.
5. On site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
6. Any structure already in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration, reconstruction or improvement to the structure.
7. Placement of fill within Special Flood Hazard Areas shall only be permitted to the minimum extent feasible and only in order to meet the elevation standards contained herein for structures or substantial improvements to structures.
8. Where feasible, structures will be setback to the maximum extent possible from wetlands, watercourses and water-bodies, and the commission or its agent may require greater setbacks to these resources as permitted under Section 25.2.1 of the Waterford zoning Regulations. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be located landward of the high tide line.
9. Equal Conveyance- Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
10. Compensatory Storage  The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction cause by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from the offsite property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
B. Manufactured Homes:
1. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved, including mobile homes placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer, shall be elevated so the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation. This includes manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park in which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.
2. All manufactured homes, as specified in part (1) above, shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored, and to which the structure is securely anchored, so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but may not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
3. Manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage and shall be provided with adequate access and drainage.
4. Manufactured homes elevation construction standards shall include piling foundations placed not more than 10 feet apart, and reinforcement shall be provided within piers extending six or more feet above ground level.
5. Recreational CampingVehicles shall either be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the general standards of Section 25.3.5 A and the elevation and anchoring requirements of Section 25.3.5.B for a manufactured home. A recreational camping vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
C. Watercourses:
1. The flood carrying capacity in any portion of a watercourse which has been altered or relocated shall be maintained or improved.
2. Watercourses without established base flood elevations shall be reviewed utilizing the data set forth in Section 25.3.4I.
D. Specific Standards:
In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been determined, the following provisions shall apply:
1. New residential construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no less than 1 foot above the base flood elevation;
2. New non-residential construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no less than 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
3. Non-residential structures may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic loads, hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall provide the certification of flood-proofing as set forth in Section 25.3.4F of these regulations.
4. All new construction or substantially improved structures on pilings or columns shall be securely anchored thereto;
5. All pilings or columns with anchored structures thereon shall be designed and constructed to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support system shall be designed and constructed with wind and water loading values which equals or exceed the 100 year mean recurrence interval, i.e. a 1 percent annual chance.
E. Elevated Buildings:
1. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings and structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed and constructed to preclude finished living space below the base flood elevation, and to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on foundation or exterior walls.
2. Designs for complying with the requirements of this Section must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or must meet the following criteria;
a. Provide a minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
b. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
c. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade;
3. Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation;
4. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles, i.e. a garage door; or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, i.e. a standard exterior door; or entry to the living area, i.e. a stairway or elevator.
5. Such enclosed areas shall not be subgrade on all four sides.
F. Floodways:
1. Applicants must address floodway issues in all areas of special flood hazard where elevations are available, whether or not a regulatory floodway has been established. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply;
2. Where floodways have been identified and adopted under Section 25.3.3.C of these regulations, the following provisions shall apply. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increases in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge published by FEMA. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design.
3. In A Zones where base flood elevations have been determined but no floodway has been identified, the following provisions shall apply: No new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when considered with all existing and anticipated development, will not increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. Applicants shall identify the floodway and there shall be no fill within this floodway. Fill within the floodplain shall be minimized per Section 25.3.5A.7.
4. The community may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the municipalitys request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community.
G. Coastal High Hazard Areas. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 25.3.3C of these regulations are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (Zones VE and Coastal Zone AE that is bounded by a line labeled Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)). These areas are subject to high velocity waters, including wave wash; therefore, the following special provisions shall apply: (Revised 8/5/13)
1. All new construction or substantial improvement shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located 1 foot above the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open and free of obstruction so as not to impede the flow of water. Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure must be elevated 1 foot above the base flood elevation and cannot be located below the structure. Any service equipment that must be located below 1 foot above the base flood elevation must be floodproofed to prevent water from entering during conditions of flooding. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support system shall be designed with wind and water loading values required by applicable State or local building codes.
2. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design, specifications, and plans for construction are in accordance with acceptable standards and are in compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1 above and Sections 25.3.5.D.4 and 25.3.5.D.5 of these regulations.
3. Non-supporting breakaway walls, lattice work or mesh screening shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided such materials are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to break away, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used, and provided the following design specifications are met:
(a) Design safe loading resistance values for each wall shall not be less than 10 nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
(b) If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting the foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).
4. If breakaway walls, lattice work or screening are utilized, the resulting enclosed space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.
5. There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage.
6. There shall be no fill used as structural support.
7. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located at least 25 feet landward of the reach of the mean high tide.
8. All manufactured homes to be newly placed or undergoing improvements shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member is located one foot above the base flood elevation. The manufactured home must also meet all the construction standards for Zone VE and Coastal Zone AE that is bounded by a line labeled Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)as per Section 25.3.5.G. and the additional standards for manufactured homes in Section 25.3.5.B. 2-4. This includes manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision or on a site in an existing manufactured home park in which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of flooding. (Revised 8/5/13)
9. Recreational Camping Vehicles shall either be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the general standards of Section 25.3.5.A., the coastal construction requirements of Section 25.3.5H., and the additional standards for manufactured homes in Section 25.3.5.B.2-4. A recreational camping vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
H. Standards for Subdivision Proposals. Requirements in all special flood hazard areas:
1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
4. In all A Zones, the flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions.

3. Deficiencies detected by review of the above information shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the verification or failure to make said corrections require herein shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
25.3.6 Special Conditions Regarding Variances for the Use of Land in Flood Hazard Areas:
The Town of Waterford Zoning Board of Appeals may grant variances to the requirements and conditions described within Section 25.3.5 herein. However, no such variance shall be granted except as permitted by the following conditions:
A. Variances shall be used only upon (1) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
B. Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
C. If new construction or substantial improvements are to be erected on a lot of ½ acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, a variance may be issued if the other conditions of this Section are complied with.
D. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historical places or the State Inventory of Historic Places.
E. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage, create no additional threat to public safety, and meet the other requirements of this section.
F. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the following criteria in granting a variance:
1. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
2. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
3. The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
4. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
5. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood condition, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, streets and bridges.
G. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purpose of these regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of these regulations.
H. If a variance is granted under the provisions of this Section, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of the Zoning Enforcement Officer that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance commensurate with the increased risk, up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and (2) such construction below the base level increases risks to life and property. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain a record of all variance actions with regard to the provisions of Section 25.3 herein, including justification for their issuance when approved, and shall report all variances so issued to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its biennial report.
I. In addition, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination rendered by the Zoning Enforcement Officer in the enforcement or administration of these regulation.

DEVELOPMENT & ARCHITECTURAL
STANDARDS
Introduction
Section 19 of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations allows for the adoption of a Planned Design District (PDD), governed by a Master Design Plan (MDP), as an alternative to the traditional development of eligible commercial, industrial, and multi-family properties within the Town of Waterford. The Town of Waterford Planning & Zoning Commission may, subject to a public hearing, rezone properties to a PDD designation based on a MDP which establishes specific zoning requirements for a proposed conceptual development, allowing for deviation from the typical requirements for use, bulk, and other development and architectural standards.
Any provision of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations not superseded by adoption of the MDP and these Development & Architectural Standards shall continue in full force and effect and shall govern the development of this PDD. In the event of any conflict, the provisions of these Development & Architectural Standards shall control.
The following Development and Architectural Standards are submitted pursuant to Section 19.3.2.4 and 19.3.2.5 of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations.

Architectural Standards
Purpose:
To provide general standards for the architectural design of buildings within the Master Design Plan to promote quality design and protect the architectural integrity of the surrounding community.
Standards:
1) Architectural Styles. A variety of compatible buildings, forms, materials and architectural details should be encouraged to accentuate the mix of uses desired, with attention given to entries and primary facades along streets, while enhancing a pedestrian-friendly environment.
2) Massing and Scale. Building massing and scale may vary within the development to reflect unique uses and the desired prominence of certain structures, providing visual focal points as appropriate. Uninterrupted lengths and heights of facades facing Boston Post Road shall be broken up through the use of architectural projections, setbacks, canopies, trellises, variations in roof form, entryways, windows, and changes in materials as necessary.
3) Materials and Colors. Exterior materials may consist of wood, synthetic wood, fiber cement (siding, panels, or trim), brick, brick veneer, cast stone, unit masonry, EIFS, GFRC, metal panels, hardy plank, asphalt shingles, metal, rubber (on flat surfaces not visible to the ground only), and any other materials approved by the Commission. Exterior building shell and trim colors shall compliment the overall architectural character of the development and remain compatible with similar buildings in the surrounding area.
4) Rooflines and Profiles. Roof forms shall express the individual integrity of each building. Flat roofs shall be screened from view from immediately adjacent public rights-of-way with parapets or other architectural features as necessary. Roof mounted mechanical equipment such as heating and air conditioning units, as well as antennas and other mechanicals, shall be properly screened from view from public rights-of-way.
5) Typical Building Facades and Elevations. See an example of Typical Building Facades and Elevations on the next page. All proposed buildings on the Conceptual Layout Plan shall have similar and/or compatible facades and elevations.
6) Design Review Board. All proposed buildings shall be subject to review by the Design Review Board in connection with the submission of any Application for Site Plan Approval.

SECTION 2  PRELIMINARY SUBDIVISION PLAN
2.1 PURPOSE_AND_PROCEDURE  The purpose of a preliminary subdivision plan is to
provide an opportunity for both staff and potential applicants to review the proposal's
compliance with the requirements of the subdivision regulations. Submittal of a
preliminary subdivision plan is not required but is strongly recommended. Such reviews
are primarily design oriented and all efforts must be made to create a proposal that
meets not only the letter, but the intent, of the Subdivision Regulations.
Preliminary subdivision plans provide the Commission's staff and potential applicants
with an opportunity to review the design's compliance with the Subdivision Regulations
before potential applicants incur engineering, application, and legal costs in conjunction
with a formal application. Preliminary reviews can point out potential areas of conflict
that can be addressed through redesign at an early stage, thus simplifying the process
during formal review with the Commission.
Before preparing a detailed subdivision plan for formal presentation to the Commission,
potential applicants should provide a preliminary subdivision plan to the Commission's
agent for review. These plans will also be referred to various Town departments for
their review and comment. Review meetings can be scheduled with the Commission's
agent upon request by contacting the Planning Office.
Preliminary plans have no official status and staff review with regard to their feasibility
in no way implies approval of the final subdivision plan. No fee or application form is
required for review of a preliminary subdivision plan. Questions involving
interpretations of the regulations may be presented to the Commission if such conflicts
have substantial impact on the preliminary design. In all cases, subdivisions shall be
designed with respect to the parcel's unique characteristics and the capacity of the land
to accommodate the design proposed.
2.2 CONTENTS  The preliminary subdivision plan, if submitted, shall be drawn to scale and
shall contain the information required as part of the Preliminary Plan Checklist in
Appendix A.
10 Town of Waterford, CT
SECTION 3  SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURES
3.1 PURPOSE  The purpose of this section is to provide predictable, lawful, and clear
procedures for the review of subdivision applications in the Town of Waterford. These
procedures are designed to demonstrate compliance with all development standards
found within these subdivisions regulations through the provision of plans and
information to the Commission, and, within the framework set by state law, to provide
the Commission with procedures for reviewing applications for subdivisions, discussing
applications within a public setting, and rendering decisions.
3.2 CONTACT COMMISSION  All applications for a subdivision shall be submitted to the
Planning Office. Applications shall be received at the next regularly scheduled meeting
of the Commission immediately following the date of submission or 35 days after
submission whichever occurs first.
3.3 REVIEWS BY THE WATERFORD CONSERVATION COMMISSION
3.3.1 Plans Including Regulated Wetlands/Watercourses  If an application includes
land defined as an inland wetland or watercourse under the provisions of
Chapter 440 of the Connecticut General Statutes or contains upland review
areas as defined in the Town of Waterford Inland Wetland and Watercourse
Regulations, the applicant shall submit an application to the Waterford
Conservation Commission (the inland wetlands regulatory agency for the Town
of Waterford) no later than the day the application is filed for the subdivision
or resubdivision with the Commission. For purposes of this section, no
application for subdivision or resubdivision which requires an Inland Wetlands
Permit as determined by the Conservation Commission or its agent shall be
approved by the Commission without an Inland Wetlands Permit.
Applications received without proof of submittal to the Conservation
Commission for an Inland Wetlands Permit may be determined to be
incomplete and may be denied. Withdrawal or denial of an Inland Wetlands
Permit application while a concurrent application is pending before the
Planning & Zoning Commission may be considered reason for denial of the
application. When such conflicts arise, applicants should withdraw the
application.
3.3.2 All Subdivision Plans  The Commission shall provide a copy of the received
application to the Conservation Commission and request that the Conservation
Commission evaluate the application for consistency with environmental, open
space and recreational goals identified in the POCD. The Commission shall
consider the Conservation Commissions report in taking final action.
11 Town of Waterford, CT
3.4 SUBMISSION OF PLAN, APPLICATION AND FEE  The plan shall be submitted with an
application in the form prescribed in Appendix B of these Regulations with the
application fee. For those subdivisions located fully or partially within the coastal
boundary as defined by CGS 22a-94 and as delineated on the Coastal Boundary Map for
the Town of Waterford which are subject to a Coastal Site Plan Review pursuant to
Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-105 through 22a-109, the subdivision plan
submitted shall in addition include an application for a Coastal Site Plan Review. Fees
for subdivision applications and Coastal Site Plan Reviews are listed in the Waterford
Code of Ordinances Chapter 16.08, as amended. In the case of a resubdivision, the fee
or fees shall apply only to those lots proposed for change by the subdivision. The plan
submitted shall be the plan upon which action is taken by the Commission.
Modifications to the plan may be made by the applicant or by action of the Commission
to approve a subdivision plan.
3.5 HEARING  The Commission may hold a public hearing regarding any subdivision
proposal within sixty-five (65) days of the date of receipt thereof if, in its judgment, the
specific circumstances require such action. No plan of resubdivision shall be approved
by the Commission without a public hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be published in
a newspaper of general circulation in the Town at least twice (2) at intervals of not less
than two (2) days, the first not more than fifteen (15) days, nor less than ten (10) days,
and the last not less than two (2) days prior to the date of such hearing, excluding the
date of the hearing and the date of publication; and by sending a copy thereof by
registered or certified mail to the applicant.
Additional public notice shall be provided for subdivision applications for which a public
hearing is to be held, as follows: The applicant shall provide a list of property owners
within 100 feet including names of all property owners, street address per the
Assessor's map, and Assessor's map(s) and parcel number(s) for each property. Such list
shall be provided at the time of application submission. Such notice shall be made by
the applicant or his agent by contacting all property owners within 100 feet or less of
the parcel to be subdivided. Such mailing shall be sent to at least one owner of each
such property not more than 15 days nor less than 10 days before the date set for the
public hearing, by transmitting the text of the public hearing notice as provided by the
Commission or its agent. Evidence of such mailing, in the form of United States Post
Office Certificates of Mailing, shall be submitted to the Planning & Zoning Commission
office not less than 5 calendar days prior to the hearing date. Failure to provide notice
as required herein may result in denial of the application.
3.6 REFERRAL TO REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY  When a subdivision is proposed that will
abut or include land in a neighboring municipality the Commission shall, before
approving the plan of subdivision, submit a copy of the plan to the Southeastern
Connecticut Council of Governments. The Agency shall, within thirty (30) days, report to
the Commission and the applicant its findings on the inter-municipal aspects of the
proposed subdivision. Such report shall be purely advisory and the failure of the Agency
12 Town of Waterford, CT
to submit a report within thirty (30) days after transmittal shall imply that the Agency
does not disapprove of the proposed subdivision.
3.7 VOTE BY THE COMMISSION  The Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or
disapprove any subdivision application or maps and plans submitted therewith within
sixty five (65) days after the public hearing thereon or, if no public hearing is held, within
sixty five (65) days after the receipt thereof, provided, however, an extension of time
not to exceed a further period of sixty-five (65) days for all time periods, cumulatively,
may be had with the consent of the applicant. Notice of the decision of the Commission
shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality
and addressed by certified mail to the applicant by its secretary or clerk, under the
secretary or clerks r signature within fifteen (15) days after such decision has been
rendered.
3.8 POSTING OF BOND  Prior to sale of any lots in the subdivision, the Commission shall
require the applicant to post a performance bond in an amount and with surety and
conditions satisfactory to it securing to the municipality the actual construction and
installation of all improvements as required by Section 6 and measures for erosion and
sedimentation control as required by Section 4.3 of these Regulations which have not
been completed by the applicant. The amount of the performance bond shall be
determined by the Commission after consultation with the Director of Public Works and
the Utility Commission, as appropriate. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not
accept insurance bonds. Release of bonds and acceptance of improvements shall be
governed by sections 6.14 and 6.15 of these Regulations.
3.9 CONDITIONAL APPROVAL  The Commission may allow the conditional endorsement of
the approved subdivision plan to be filed prior to the submission of a performance
bond. The plans shall have a signature block for the Chairman to endorse the
conditional approval. The signature block shall be located below a notation which reads
in bold print: "This subdivision has been conditionally approved. No transfer of title for
any lot shall occur until the required improvements have been completed and final
approval has been granted or upon the provision of a performance bond in accordance
with these regulations ($1,000.00 penalty per lot)."
Above the required note shall be a blank space measuring 3" high by 5" wide for the
final plan endorsement. The endorsement of this block shall constitute release of
conditional approval and final plan approval. Prior to the filing of a subdivision plan
conditionally approved, an erosion control and site restoration bond shall be submitted
to the Commission. The bond shall be at least 10% of the total performance bond
estimate and shall ensure compliance with the certified erosion control plan, and to
allow for site restoration. Notice of conditional approval shall be posted in the land
evidence records by the use of the form in Appendix C of these Regulations.
13 Town of Waterford, CT
3.10 ENDORSEMENT OF THE PLAN  If the Commission votes to approve a plan or modify and
approve a plan, its approval with the date thereof, together with a statement of any
modifications applying to such approval, shall be endorsed and signed by the Chairman
or Secretary of the Commission. Prior to endorsement, the Applicant shall provide two
paper copies and one PDF copy of the plan to the Planning Office to serve as check
prints. Other supporting electronic files shall be provided in accordance with the
checklist requirements in Appendix A. These check prints shall be reviewed
administratively to confirm that any conditions of approval have been met. Upon
satisfactory review of the check prints, the Applicant shall provide one mylar copy and
eight (8) white print paper copies with space provided for endorsement. Any lot not
approved for building purposes shall be so marked on the plan prior to endorsement.
Such endorsement shall occur, and the applicant notified, as follows:
3.10.1 Not more than thirty (30) days after the time for taking an appeal from the
action of the Commission has elapsed; or not more than thirty (30) days after
the date that plans modified in accordance with the Commissions approval
and that comply with Connecticut General Statutes Section 7-31 are delivered
to the Commission, whichever is later.

has been endorsed thereon by the chairman or secretary of the Commission, and the
filing or recording of a subdivision plan without such approval shall be void. At such
time as the Commission Chairman or Secretary endorse the Final Subdivision Plan in
accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Commission shall cause the applicant to
be notified, by certified mail, that such endorsement has occurred. Such notice shall
constitute "delivery" for the purposes of Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25.
3.11 FILING THE PLAN  The endorsed mylar of the Final Subdivision Plan shall be filed by the
applicant in the Office of the Town Clerk and any plan not so filed within ninety (90)
days following the date of the Commission's vote to approve the subdivision or within
ninety (90)days of the date upon which such plan is taken as approved by reason of the
failure of the Commission to act, shall become null and void, except that the
Commission may extend the time for such filing for two additional periods of ninety (90)
days and the plan shall remain valid until the expiration of such extended time.
3.12 ALTERATION OF FINAL SUBDIVISION PLAN PRIOR TO FILING WITH TOWN CLERK  No
Final Subdivision Plan may be altered without approval from the Planning and Zoning
Commission. If the Final Subdivision Plan is altered, changed, erased or revised in any
14 Town of Waterford, CT
way between the time the Commission's approval is endorsed thereon and the time the
Plan is filed with the Town Clerk, the modification shall be void unless the alteration has
been approved by the Commission and so indicated on the Plan.
3.13 ALTERATION OF FINAL SUBDIVISION PLAN AFTER FILING WITH TOWN CLERK  If the
Final Subdivision Plan is altered, changed, erased, or revised in any way after the time
the Plan is filed with the Town Clerk, the modification shall be void unless the Amended
Subdivision has been approved by the Commission and a new Final Plan endorsed and
filed with the Town Clerk.
3.14 AMENDMENT OF AN APPROVED SUBDIVISION  Amendments to an approved
subdivision may be approved through a Zoning Compliance Permit when one or more of
the following conditions are met and the amendments do not require resubdivision
pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes:
3.14.1 Lot Line Revisions where no more than two lot lines are revised.
3.14.2 Corrections of clerical errors.
3.14.3 Minor modifications to proposed improvements not in areas reserved for
public use, provided that the modifications do not adversely affect adjacent
properties, stormwater management features, or otherwise impair public
health, safety or welfare.
Where amendments to an approved subdivision do not meet the above criteria for
administrative approval, the Commission may approve an amended subdivision upon
request of the Applicant. All provisions of the original approved subdivision or resubdivision
shall be complied with, except as specifically approved by the Commission.
No amended subdivision shall be deemed final until an endorsed Final Subdivision Plan
has been filed in the Office of the Town Clerk. The Commission shall hold a public
hearing when reviewing proposed amendments meeting the definition of resubdivision.
3.15 COMPLETION OF WORK  Any person, firm or corporation making any subdivision of
land shall complete all work in connection with such subdivision within five years after
the approval of the plan for such subdivision; the Commission's endorsement of
approval on the plan shall state the date on which such five year period expires. For
purposes of this section, the term "work" shall mean all physical improvements required
by the approval plan, other than staking out lots, and includes but is not limited to the
construction of roads, storm drainage facilities and water and sewer lines, the setting
aside of open space and recreation areas, installation of telephone and electric services,
planting of trees and other landscaping, and installation of retaining walls or other
structures.
3.16 PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY  In accordance with Connecticut General Statutes
Section 8-25, any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association making the
subdivision or re-subdivision of land without approval of the Commission shall be liable
15 Town of Waterford, CT
to a fine of One Thousand ($1,000.00.) Dollars for each lot sold or offered for sale. In
the event that any subdivider shall violate these Regulations, or the conditions or
requirements of any subdivision approved hereunder, the Commission may, following a
public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any
such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records.
3.17 EXTENSION OF TIME  In accordance with Connecticut General Statues Section 8-26c,
the Commission may grant extensions of time for the Applicant or Applicants designee
to complete all public improvements, such extensions of time not to exceed an
additional five (5) years. In determining whether to grant such extensions of time, or
the length of each such extension of time, the Commission shall consider:
3.17.1 The number of dwellings or other buildings occupied in the subdivision and
served by such public improvements. As the occupancy of a subdivision
increases, the need for the completion and acceptance of the improvements
also increases.
3.17.2 The extent to which public improvements are incomplete and the amount of
work required for final completion. The more work that remains to be done,
the more time is appropriate and, conversely, the less work that remains to be
done, the more feasible it is for the subdivider to finish the work and have the
public improvement accepted.
3.17.3 The length of time that the public improvements have been at their current
stage of completion. To the extent that the subdivider is not diligently working
to complete public improvements, a shorter period of extension is appropriate.
3.17.4 The overall condition of access roads and other public improvements that are
necessary for emergency services, resident access, visitor access, and other
vehicles and pedestrians. To the extent that public improvements are difficult
or inconvenient to use, a shorter period of extension is appropriate.
3.17.5 Changes in the zoning or subdivision regulations, or in applicable State laws,
that render the subdivision noncompliant with current standards of public
health, safety, welfare, environmental protection, coastal area management.
3.17.6 Other matters that the Commission may lawfully consider when acting on
subdivision applications.
16 Town of Waterford, CT
SECTION 4  FINAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 CONTENTS  An applicant for subdivision shall submit Final Plan materials in accordance
with the application checklists attached as Appendix A to these regulations. These
checklists are designed to provide information required by the Commission in order to
determine compliance with the design standards within these regulations and render a
decision. These plans include:
4.1.1 Context Plan  The purpose of this plan is to provide the geographic and
planning context of the property and the surrounding environs.
4.1.2 Existing Conditions Plan  The purpose of this plan is to provide a
comprehensive inventory of the physical opportunities and constraints on the
property. Conditions beyond the property boundaries may be described on the
basis of existing published data available from governmental agencies, and
from aerial photographs.
4.1.3 Proposed Subdivision Plan Set  The purpose of this plan is to provide a fully
engineered subdivision design that meets the design requirements of these
regulations. Lot sizes and other bulk requirements shall be in accordance with
Section 3.16 of the Zoning Regulations. The Commission shall review the plan
to assess its accuracy, conformance with municipal regulations, and likely
impact upon the natural and cultural resources on the property.
4.1.4 Supplementary Information  The purpose of this submittal is to provide
narrative information or other documentation that substantiates the
information on site plans.
4.1.5 Supporting Materials  The purpose of this submittal is to ensure the Town has
information regarding other permits, utilities, encumbrances, and similar
issues.
4.2 THIRD PARTY PEER REVIEW  Pursuant to the Waterford Code of Ordinance Chapter
16.08, the Commission may require third party peer review for conventional or cluster
subdivisions in accordance with the following conditions:
4.2.1 The Commission shall require third party peer review for any proposed
subdivision that will require site disturbance of more than ten (10) acres. This
peer review shall include a review of the design and viability of the stormwater
management system, the provision of access to the Town for enforcement or
repair related to project infrastructure, and compliance with all applicable local
regulations.
4.2.2 The Commission may require third party peer review for projects that disturb
fewer than ten (10) acres, but have the potential to adversely impact municipal
infrastructure, adjacent properties, require significant regrading of existing
topography, or that may create hazardous conditions during or after
construction.
17 Town of Waterford, CT
4.2.3 The Commission may waive the requirement for third party peer review where
there will clearly be no adverse impact to municipal infrastructure, and where
site conditions do not require significant regrading of existing topography.
4.3 EROSION & SEDIMENT CONTROL PLANS AND NARRATIVE  In order to minimize the
erosion of topsoil and the depositing of sediments in drainage structures and
watercourses in the Town of Waterford, the Commission shall require that plans for the
subdivision of land include measures the applicant will take to control erosion and
sedimentation during the construction of the subdivision and to prevent its occurrence
after completion of the subdivision. This requirement shall apply to both standard and
cluster subdivisions. Erosion and Sediment Control measures shall be in conformance
with all applicable provisions of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations.
18 Town of Waterford, CT
SECTION 5  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it
can be used for building purposes without danger to health and public safety. Every
effort shall be made to locate streets, building lots and open space in a manner that
avoids sensitive resources, reduces disturbance and associated impacts, and manages
construction and post-construction impacts. To the extent possible, development shall
be compatible with the landscape and existing cultural and archaeological resources,
resulting in a minimum disturbance of the natural terrain and vegetation.
5.2 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING  In areas contiguous to water bodies subject to flooding,
including tidal flooding, proper provisions shall be made for protective flood control
measures. Such land as identified on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and in the Flood
Insurance Study as amended shall not be subdivided unless the following conditions are
met:
5.2.1 Water supply and sewage disposal systems shall be designed and located so as
to avoid impairment or contamination from flooding, erosion or related
circumstances.
5.2.2 All utilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
5.2.3 Drainage systems shall be designed to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
5.2.4 The Applicant shall demonstrate that proposed development conforms to all
applicable FEMA requirements.
5.2.5 The Applicant shall demonstrate that proposed development meets the
requirements of section 25.3 of the Waterford Zoning Regulations.
5.3 LOTS
5.3.1 Lot Sizes  All lots in proposed subdivisions shall conform to the requirements
of the Zoning Regulations, except that the Commission may require larger lots
if needed to conform to state or local health requirements and Section 3.34 of
the Zoning Regulations.
5.3.2 Frontage  All lots shall have frontage on an approved street consistent with
the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Waterford. Access to a lot shall be taken
across the frontage of the lot except lots fronting on arterial roads and in the
case where the Commission determines that a combined drive serving two lots
will reduce traffic conflicts or reduce environmental impacts. In subdivisions
which include or abut arterial streets, the layout of lots shall avoid having lot
frontages on the arterial street, unless provisions are made for frontage
improvements that control noise and limit access to a level of safety equivalent
to a public road intersection with an arterial road as prescribed in Section 5.6.
19 Town of Waterford, CT
5.3.3 Side Lot Lines  Wherever possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the
road and radial to curves. The width of the lot shall not be reduced below the
minimum frontage required from the front property line to the building line.
5.3.4 Minimum Square  Each lot shall be capable of containing a square, each of
whose side dimensions shall be equal to the minimum lot width required in the
zone in which it is located. The minimum square shall be located at the building
line. The minimum buildable square, as required in Section 3.34 of the Zoning
Regulations, shall be located within the minimum square. (See illustration).
MINIMUM SQUARE REQUIREMENT ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY IN
FRONTAGE REQUIREMENTS AND RESULTS IN MORE UNIFORM
LOT AREAS AT THE SAME RELATIVE DENSITY
5.3.5 Lots On Slopes  In the case of lots on land sloping more than ten (10) percent,
the Commission shall require that the construction plan, as required pursuant
to the Application Checklists of these Regulations, shall show the location of
the proposed principal building, driveway, and sewerage leaching field, if any.
Wherever possible, the first floor elevation of a principal structure shall be
higher than the grade of the road on which it fronts.
5.3.6 All Land to Be in Lots  No land owned by the subdivider adjacent to the
subdivision shall be withheld by the subdivider which is not capable of
satisfactory independent subdivision into lots of the size specified. Nor shall
there be any fragment of a lot or remainder in the subdivision area of less size
than specified for lot dimensions. Fragments and remainders must be
incorporated into full size lots complying with all provisions of these
Regulations and the Zoning Regulations.
5.3.7 No Unapproved Lots  No lot, regardless of size, which is rendered useless for
building due to utility easements, right-of-way, watercourses, topography, or
20 Town of Waterford, CT
lack of compliance with the Public Health Code or Section 3.34 (Lot Design
Standards) of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations shall be shown as
building lots on any subdivision. Such property shall be included in adjoining
lots or Open Space.
5.3.8 Flag Lots  No more than twenty percent (20%) of any subdivision lots shall be
flag lots. No more than one (1) lot may be located between the flag lot and the
street from which the lot is accessed. Flag lots shall not be permitted within
Cluster Subdivisions.
5.4 OPEN SPACE
5.4.1 General Requirements  The Commission shall consider significant and
sensitive natural characteristics, archaeological and cultural resources of the
property when identifying meaningful and appropriate open space lands. The
Commission may require open space for active recreation when it finds that
active recreation is consistent with the POCD, with particular attention to open
space recommendations in the Open Space and Recreation or Community
Facilities element of the POCD. For subdivisions containing 15 lots or more, the
Commission shall require active open space to be provided in addition to the
minimum open space requirement below. When required, active open space
area shall be calculated as no less than 10% of the minimum open space
required.
5.4.2 Minimum Requirement  In a conventional subdivision, at least 25% of the
gross area of the subdivision shall be set aside and dedicated in perpetuity as
open space and recreation area. The Commission may accept additional open
space in order to protect important resources identified on the Existing
Conditions Plan pursuant to the checklists found in Appendix A. Stormwater
management facilities shall not count toward the minimum required open
space area. For cluster subdivisions, the minimum amount of open space shall
comply with the requirements of the Zoning Regulations Section 3.16.4. The
land included in the preserved open space for any subdivision shall be deemed
as highly valuable conservation and/or recreation land by the Commission in
accordance with the POCD. As each site will present different opportunities,
the applicant shall use the narrative section of the Supplementary Information
to provide a justification for the proposed open space. Characteristics of land
area that may be used as part of this justification may include, but are not
limited to:
5.4.2.1. Land that contains significant cultural or natural resources; or
5.4.2.2. Land that is contiguous with other permanently protected open
space; or
21 Town of Waterford, CT
5.4.2.3. Land that would not otherwise be protected by local, State, or federal
law; or
5.4.2.4. Land that provides protective buffers to neighboring residents,
wetlands, or water courses; or
5.4.2.5. Land identified by the POCD as valuable for conservation; or
5.4.2.6. Land that is well-suited to the development of active recreation due
to physical characteristics.
5.4.3 Power Lines  The minimum Open Space requirement shall not include power
line rights of way.
5.4.4 Access Requirements - Open Space lands shall be accessible to all residential
lot owners in the subdivision by a single dedicated common access point.
5.4.5 Exemptions  No open space shall be required in subdivisions of fewer than
five lots or having the total area of the subdivision less than five acres. The
Commission may require open space in such subdivisions when the property
includes areas designated as open space or recreation in the Open Space and
Recreation or Community Facilities elements of the POCD. The open space
requirements of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a
subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister,
grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no consideration, or if
the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a of
the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty per cent or more of the
total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. Such intended transfer
shall be evidenced by covenants, restrictions, contracts, or other legally
binding documents as the Commission may approve, which documents shall be
filed in the Land Records in accordance with the procedure and other
requirements of these Regulations. If the Commission determines, based on
events subsequent to the approval of such subdivision, that such transfers
were intended to be temporary, and for the sole purpose of evading the
requirements of this Section 5.4.4, the Commission may void the subdivision in
accordance these Regulations.
5.5 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
5.5.1 Purpose  To reduce impacts of stormwater run-off volume and quality on
receiving wetlands, waterways, groundwater resources, aquatic habitat and
municipal drainage infrastructure.
5.5.2 General Criteria
5.5.2.1. Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual. At a minimum, all
subdivisions shall comply with the performance standards of the most
22 Town of Waterford, CT
recent version of Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, as
amended, as well as the General Criteria below. Stormwater
management practices and measures shall be in conformance with all
applicable provisions of the Town of Waterford Zoning Regulations.
Where there may be a perceived conflict between the standards
provided in these regulations and the Connecticut Stormwater
Manual, the standards in these regulations shall govern.
5.5.2.2. No Untreated Discharges. All stormwater runoff generated from
subdivision activities shall not discharge untreated stormwater runoff
directly to a wetland, local water body, municipal drainage system, or
abutting property, without adequate treatment.
5.5.2.3. Use of Low Impact Development (LID). Incorporation of LID measures
is required to the maximum extent practicable for new development
in order to promote recharge, reduce runoff volumes, and minimize
reliance on structural stormwater management measures. Low
Impact Development measures are site design techniques and
practices that serve to preserve and maintain a sites predevelopment
hydrology through implementation of small-scale
controls to manage run-off. The Site Design Criteria require that the
site planning process shall be documented and shall follow the
objectives listed in the Low Impact Development Appendix to the
Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, including:
A. Avoiding installation of roof drains that discharge to
impervious surfaces.
B. Directing flows to vegetated areas.
C. Directing flows from paved areas to stabilized vegetated
areas.
D. Breaking up flow directions from large paved surfaces.
E. Encouraging sheet flow through vegetated areas.
F. Locating impervious areas so that they drain to permeable
areas.
G. Maximizing overland sheet flow.
H. Lengthening flow paths and increase the number of flow
paths.
I. Maximizing use of open swale systems.
J. Increasing (or augmenting) the amount of vegetation on the
site.
K. Restricting ground disturbance to the smallest possible area.
L. Reducing pavement and impervious surface areas.
M. Avoiding compaction or disturbance of highly permeable soils.
N. Avoiding removal of existing trees.
O. Reducing the use of turf and using more natural land cover.
P. Maintaining existing topography and drainage divides.
23 Town of Waterford, CT
Q. Locating structures, roadways on Type C soils where feasible.
5.5.2.4. Stormwater Practices on Residential Lots. Wherever practicable, the
design of individual subdivision lots should incorporate LID
stormwater practices to reduce run-off volumes.
5.5.3. STORMWATER DESIGN CRITERIA
5.5.3.1 Groundwater Recharge Volume (Re)
A. Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by
promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural
methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the
post-development site shall approximate the annual
groundwater recharge from pre-development site conditions.
B. The Re should be determined using the methods prescribed in
the latest version of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality
Manual. The recharge requirements shall apply to all activities
within the jurisdiction of these Regulations except as noted,
and unless specifically modified by the Commission. The
Commission may relax or eliminate the recharge requirement
at its discretion, if the site is situated on unsuitable soils or is
in a redevelopment area with documentation of prior
contaminated soils.
C. Soil testing shall be performed in locations that can
substantiate the ability of subsurface conditions to recharge
stormwater in accordance with the proposed stormwater
management facilities. Depth to seasonal high groundwater,
restrictive layers, and infiltration rates as determined through
appropriate field permeability tests shall be verified by a
qualified professional registered in the State of Connecticut.
5.5.3.2 Water Quality Volume (WQv)  the amount of stormwater run-off
from any given storm that should be captured and treated in order to
remove a majority of stormwater pollutants on an average annual
basis, equivalent to run-off associated with the first one inch of
rainfall.
The prescribed water quality volume required in the sizing of a
structural stormwater practice shall be determined using the
methods prescribed in the latest version of the Connecticut
Stormwater Quality Manual.
24 Town of Waterford, CT
5.5.3.3 Structural Practices for Water Quality
A. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be
selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the
most recent version of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality
Manual and the guidelines provided in Appendix G of these
regulations.
An applicant may propose other tested and documented
stormwater treatment facilities provided the technical design
criteria and supporting scientific studies of the facility
performance are provided for the Commissions review and
approval.
B. Structural stormwater management facilities must be
designed to, at a minimum, capture and treat the water
quality volume (WQv) from the development area, and to
reduce post-development stormwater pollutant discharge to
the maximum extent practicable. Stormwater treatment
practices shall be implemented in series to attain increased
attenuation of stormwater pollutants. It is presumed the
stormwater management facility functions and achieves
documented pollutant removal rates if it is:
i) Accurately sized to capture the prescribed water
quality volume;
ii) Designed according to the specific design and siting
criteria outlined in the Connecticut Stormwater Quality
Manual;
iii) Constructed properly; and
iv) Maintained regularly.
The Commission may require a stormwater treatment design to
attenuate specific stormwater pollutants of concern where the
receiving waters are identified as impaired or susceptible to water
quality impairment, or are in areas where Total Maximum Daily Loads
(TMDLs) have been established. Applicants may be required to
submit documentation to demonstrate the performance of the facility
25 Town of Waterford, CT
in removal of pollutants based on available scientific
literature/studies documenting pollutant removal efficiencies.
Designed water quality structures treating run-off from more than
one [1] lot shall be located within a designated stormwater drainage
easement or stormwater open space area with an identified access
way for maintenance equipment. Access ways shall be designed in
accordance with Appendix G. Where the materials in Appendix G are
silent on the issue of access, a 15-foot wide access way or equivalent
feature shall be provided to allow unobstructed traverse of required
maintenance equipment.
5.5.3.4 Runoff Reduction  Designers shall use Low Impact Development
(LID) strategies and site design techniques to reduce the generation
of stormwater runoff to the maximum extent practicable such that
there is no discharge from the 1-year, 24 hour Type III design storm
(i.e., the entire runoff volume is reused, infiltrated, evaporated,
and/or otherwise retained on site). Proposed projects meeting this
standard automatically meet the Water Quality standard. Projects
that do not retain the 1-year, 24 hour Type III design storm on site are
required to retain the stormwater runoff volume generated by the
first inch of rainfall on site, and must meet the requirements for
Water Quality. If full compliance is not provided, the application must
document why key steps in the process could not be met and what is
proposed as mitigation. The objective of this standard is to provide a
process by which LID is considered at an early stage in the planning
process such that stormwater impacts are prevented rather than
mitigated.
5.5.3.5 Stream Channel Protection  Consistent with the Connecticut
Stormwater Quality Manual and CT E&S Guidelines, protection of
channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be
provided by:
A. Controlling the 2-year; 24-hour post-development peak flow
rate to 50 percent of the 2-year; 24-hour pre-development
level; or
B. Controlling the 2-year; 24-hour post-development peak flow
rate to the 1-year; 24-hour pre-development level.
5.5.3.6 Channel Protection Waiver  Requirements for stream channel
protection may be waived for:
26 Town of Waterford, CT
A. Small sites (i.e., sites requiring less than 1-inch orifice); or
B. Sites with post-development discharges less than 2 cfs; or
C. Direct discharges to 4th order or greater streams, lakes, and
reservoirs, where the development area is less than 5% of the
watershed area upstream of the development site; or
D. Indirect discharges to an existing drainage network with
adequate capacity to accommodate the flows from the site
where the ultimate discharge is to a 4th order or greater
stream, lake, or reservoir.
5.5.3.7 Flooding Protection (Qp)  Downstream flood, property, and public safety
protection shall be provided by attenuating the post-development peak
discharge rates for the 10-year, 25-year and 100-year 24-hour return
frequency storm events to the pre-development rates. In addition,
designers must demonstrate that runoff from the site for storms up to the
100-year, 24-hour Type III design storm events actually reach proposed
structural practices designed to meet this standard. The objective of this
standard is to prevent an increase in the frequency and magnitude of
overbank flooding and to protect downstream and abutting structures from
flooding.
5.5.3.8 Downstream Impacts  Analysis of potential impacts to downstream
channels, infrastructure, or property shall be required consistent with
the guidance provided in Chapter 7 of the Connecticut Stormwater
Quality Manual.
5.5.3.9 Conveyance Criteria
Where practicable, low impact development practices to promote
sheetflow of roadway run-off to vegetated areas, permeable soils and
water quality treatment facilities shall be incorporated to reduce
concentrated run-off volumes and velocities.
A. The proposed stormwater conveyance system shall, at
minimum, accommodate the runoff from a 10-year storm
event. The discharge from any stormwater facility must be
conveyed through properly constructed water courses to
provide for non-erosive flows during all storm events. Rip-rap
(or other approved energy dissipaters) shall be placed at all
flared-end sections, pipe outlets, overflow weirs, drainage
swales, and any other location. Rip-rap shall be sized such
that the stones will be able to resist movement due to
discharge velocity.
B. Catchbasins shall be located on both sides of the roadway on
continuous grades at intervals of not more than three
27 Town of Waterford, CT
hundred feet (300'), at low points, and at the corners of
intersecting streets. Where a roadway is not crowned, and is
pitched to one side, catch basins shall be required only on the
downgradient side. Intervals of less than three hundred feet
(300') may be required on steep grades. The Commission may
ask for an inlet capacity analysis on a case-by-case basis.
C. All drain lines to be connected to the municipal drain line shall
be constructed by way of a drain manhole being installed
between the existing drain line and the proposed drain line(s).
D. Emergency outlets must safely pass the post-development
peak runoff from the 100-year design storm event in a
controlled manner without erosion of the outlet works or
downstream drainage system and provide a freeboard of at
least one (1) foot.
5.5.4 Hydrologic Basis for Design of Structural Practices
For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of
development sites are as follows:
5.5.4.1 Impervious cover is measured from the site plan and includes any
material or structure on or above the ground that prevents water
from infiltrating through the underlying soil. Impervious surface is
defined to include, without limitation: paved parking lots, sidewalks,
roof tops, driveways, patios, and paved, gravel, and compacted dirt
surfaced roads. Alternative surfaces (e.g., porous pavement, grass
pavers, etc.) are encouraged for low-traffic sidewalks and parking
lots, and these areas may be removed from the total impervious area
calculations when designing the stormwater system for recharge and
water quality criteria only. General design guidance is included in the
most recent version of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual.
5.5.4.2 Off-site areas draining to the site shall be included in the hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses.
5.5.4.3 The models TR-55 and TR-20 (or approved equivalent) shall be used
for sizing all stormwater practices other than those used strictly for
conveyance.
5.5.4.4 Stormwater conveyance features shall be sized using the Rational
Method.
5.5.4.5 For purposes of computing runoff and assigning hydrologic curve
numbers, all pervious lands in the site prior to development shall be
assumed to be in good condition regardless of conditions existing at
the time of computation.
5.5.4.6 The specified design storms shall be defined as 24-hour, Type III
distribution design storm events using the rainfall amounts specified
28 Town of Waterford, CT
for New London County in the most recent database from the
Northeast Regional Climate Center.
5.5.4.7 Subdivisions shall apply these stormwater management criteria to the
land development as a whole. Hydrologic parameters shall reflect the
ultimate land development and shall be used in all engineering
calculations. The volume or rate of run-off reduced by LID practices
on individual lots shall not be factored into the design of stormwater
management systems that control and treat run-off from the
contributing drainage area of the subdivision property.
5.5.5 Operations and Maintenance Requirements
An Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan for all stormwater management
systems, including structural and non-structural controls, shall be submitted
for Commission approval as part of the application documents. The O&M plan
shall be developed to ensure the system and its components function as
designed and is maintained so as not to create or result in a nuisance

Where permitted by the Planning and Zoning Commission, a stormwater
management system serving the subdivision or a portion thereof is to be
32 Town of Waterford, CT
owned by a homeowners association, such stormwater management systems,
including all non-structural and structural stormwater controls and
conveyances, must have an enforceable operation and maintenance plan and
agreement to ensure that it continues to function as designed. The owner of
each stormwater management system shall maintain it so as not to create or
result in a nuisance condition, such as but not limited to flooding, erosion,
excessive algal growth, overgrown vegetation, mosquito breeding habitat,
existence of unsightly debris, or impairments to public safety and health.
Approval of any application for a subdivision shall include the approval of a
Long-Term Operation and Maintenance Plan; an Annual Maintenance
Inspection Report; and an Operation and Maintenance Agreement. The owner
shall receive constructive notice of such maintenance obligation by the filing of
a declaration on the land records for each such lot at the time of endorsement,
which declaration shall be in a form acceptable to the Commissions attorney.
Stormwater Management systems located on a single lot to serve that lot shall
be maintained by the owner of said lot, which obligation shall be enforceable
in accordance with a declaration using the form in Appendix E.
5.6 STREETS
5.6.1 Design Objectives  Proposed streets shall be designed in a thoughtful manner
that is consistent with the POCD. Design objectives include:
5.6.1.1 Streets shall be designed in harmony with existing and proposed

5.7 WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS
5.7.1 General  Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from compliance with these Regulations, it
may, by a three-quarters vote, approve waivers to these Subdivision
Regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such waiver shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of these Regulations; and further provided the Commission
shall not approve waivers unless it shall make findings based upon evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
5.7.1.1 The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or have a significant adverse effect on
other adjacent property;
A. The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based
are unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and
are not applicable generally to other property;
B. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if these Regulations
are carried out;
C. The waiver will not in any manner conflict with the provisions
of the Zoning Regulations, POCD, or Regulations of any other
Town Board or Commission.
5.7.2 Conditions  In approving waivers, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these Regulations.
5.7.3 Procedures  Petitions for any such waiver shall be submitted in writing by the
subdivider at the time when the subdivision plan is filed for the consideration
of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all of the facts called upon by the petitioner. The Commission
shall hold a public hearing in accordance with Section 3.5 of the Regulations

5.8 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
5.8.1 All subdivisions, including cluster subdivisions, shall be planned and designed
to encourage energy conservation, energy efficient development patterns, and
the use of renewable energy forms through use of as many of the following
guidelines as possible:
5.8.1.1 Where natural features or other planning considerations do not limit
street layout and location, streets should have an east-west
orientation to the greatest extent possible with acceptable variations
up to 15 degrees north or south of due east to provide for southerly
building orientation.
5.8.1.2 Lot lines may be oriented in a fashion other than that provided in
Section 5.3.3 of these Regulations if such orientation is necessary to
secure, protect, or control solar access or enable solar-ready roof
orientation.
5.8.1.3 Primary and reserve leaching field areas should be planned and
located to the south of a proposed building location whenever such a
location is suitable for such purposes and will aid in the use of solar
energy systems due to tree removal and regrading associated with
the sewage disposal system.
5.8.1.4 Species of street trees should be chosen taking into account their
suitability in relationship with solar access objectives. Street trees
should be located in such a manner as to avoid shading the most
southerly side of proposed structures in order to facilitate the use of
solar energy systems.
5.8.2 The subdivider shall demonstrate to the Commission that consideration has
been given to the use of passive solar energy techniques which would not
significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer after tax credits,
subsidies, and exemptions, and maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss,
and provide thermal storage within a building during the heating season and
minimize heat gain and provide natural ventilation during the cooling season.
The site design techniques shall include, but not be limited to: (1) house
orientation; (2) street and lot layout; (3) vegetation; (4) natural and man-made
topographical features; and (5) protection of solar access within the
development. A written statement outlining how this requirement has been
adhered to shall be required.

Utility Commission shall provide design capacities and elevations for such
system and the applicant shall design and install the system to these
specifications. All open ends of the system shall be capped and as-built plans
provided showing exact locations and elevations so that capped ends can be
readily located.
If the applicant proposes to utilize a community sewerage system, as defined
in Connecticut General Statutes Section 7-245, the applicant shall provide a
report from the Waterford Utility Commission indicating that all requirements
of Connecticut General Statutes Section 7-246f have been satisfied.
6.10.3 Electrical, telephone and cable television lines shall be installed underground
by the developer.
6.11 STREET TREES  Street trees shall be selected from and meet the requirements in
Section 5.6.2.6 and Appendix D of these regulations. New trees shall be nursery grown,
of specimen quality, balled and burlapped, straight stemmed, free from disease, and
treated for any bark injuries. Each street shall have a mix of species selected from the
44 Town of Waterford, CT
list in Appendix D. In no case shall more than 20% of trees provided be of the same
species. The size of each tree to be planted shall conform to the most recent version of
the American Standard for Nursery Stock ANSI Z60.1.
6.12 OPEN SPACE  The Commission shall require grading, seeding, planting, fencing, and
other reasonable improvements to the open space to be used for active recreation
purposes, unless a waiver of these activities has been granted. Open space land shall, at
the Commission's discretion, be either deeded to the Town, deeded to a land trust,
controlled through an undivided interest among the property owners or held in
corporate ownership by property owners in the subdivision. In the event of the latter, a
copy of the bylaws of homeowners association and the covenants of the warranty deed
guaranteeing right of use by the members of such association and perpetual
reservation of the property as open space shall be submitted to the Commission prior to
the approval of the subdivision plan. Such open space shall be transferred to the
homeowners association upon sale of seventy-five percent (75%) of the lots in the
subdivision or section thereof. The HOA deed to the open space shall be provided at the
time of application and shall be filed on the land records with the approved subdivision
mylars. Such open space shall not be used for commercial activity.
In the event that the homeowners association established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall fail to maintain such common
open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the
Commission, through its Chairman, may serve written notice upon such association or
upon the residents of the subdivision setting forth the manner in which the organization
has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition. Such notice
shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty
days after the receipt of such notice and shall state the date and place of a hearing
which shall be held within fourteen days after receipt of such notice. At such hearing
the Commission may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and
may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set
forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof have not been cured within
thirty days or any extension of such time, the Commission shall so notify the First
Selectman and the Town may take such actions within its legal right to enter onto the
property and maintain the facility. Such entry and maintenance shall not vest in the
public any rights to use the open space. If the First Selectman determines that such
association is ready and able to maintain such common open space in reasonable
condition, the Town shall cease to maintain such open space and all maintenance
obligations to such common open space shall revert back to the homeowners
association.
The cost of such maintenance and all related administrative costs incurred by the Town
shall be assessed ratably against the properties within such subdivision that have a right
of enjoyment of the open space, and, following such procedures as may be required by
law, shall become a lien on said properties. The homeowners association documents
45 Town of Waterford, CT
shall contain a requirement that if the Town must perform maintenance, repairs, or
other work pursuant to this Section, that the Association shall reimburse the Town for
its attorneys fees and costs, including expert witness fees; and that such obligation may
be secured by a lien against the individual lots.
6.13 CLEAN-UP  Upon suspension or completion of the installation of improvements or any
portion thereof, the developer or contractor shall remove from all public or private
property, all temporary structures, tools and equipment, tree stumps, excess earth
materials, rubbish, or waste materials resulting from his operations. All ditches shall be
filled; all sewers, drains, catch basins and manholes cleaned and flushed; streets, walks,
curbs, and other structures cleaned and repaired, and the whole work area left in a neat
and clean condition.
6.13.1 Prior to the issue of a certificate of occupancy, the site and surrounding
areas shall be inspected and cleaned up to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall inspect the
site at regular intervals to insure the removal of all unsightly piles of rock,
earth, felled trees, brush, stumps, discarded building material and all
other rubbish or debris. In the case of a subdivision involving several lots,
the contiguous lots or "open space" may not be used as dumping areas
for waste or excess material except that such materials may be used for
land improvement purposes at the discretion of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer or the Zoning Enforcement Officers agent.
6.14 BONDING
6.14.1 The performance bond required pursuant to section 3.8 of these
Regulations shall remain up to date and in effect until all improvements are
accepted in accordance with Section 6.15. Application may be made to the
Commission for release of a portion of the performance bond as portions of
the total improvements are completed, except that no more than ninety (90)
percent of the total performance bond shall be released prior to acceptance of

turfing, or any other structures and improvements on the line of the work or
adjacent thereto, occurring during the maintenance period which are caused
by or affected by the contractor or developers work.
6.14.4 If the contractor or developer fails to remedy such defects within a reasonable
time, the Board of Selectmen may, without prejudice to any other remedy and
upon written notice to the contractor or developer, cause the required repairs
to be made and bill the contractor or developer for the cost of the work then
involved. A "reasonable time" shall be held to be a period not to exceed sixty
(60) days, except that a longer period may be allowed by the Board of
Selectmen during the winter months of the year, notwithstanding emergencies
as identified by the Utility Commission or Director of Public Works. Emergency
remedies shall be completed in the time specified by the Utility Commission or
Director of Public Works.

SECTION 7 - CLUSTER SUBDIVISION
7.1 PURPOSES
To implement the objectives of the Plan of Conservation, Preservation and
Development, pursuant to and consistent with Section 3.16 of the Zoning Regulations,
the purposes of this section include:
7.1.1. To reduce overall development disturbance of land;
7.1.2. To provide an opportunity of greater flexibility in the design of subdivisions
with a view toward preserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the
landscape;
7.1.3. To protect areas with unique or fragile natural features, including but not
limited to rare species and habitat;
7.1.4. To produce more attractive, safe, and healthy living environments;
7.1.5. To provide greater variety of housing types to meet community needs;
7.1.6. To provide opportunities for development patterns that are more energy
efficient;
7.1.7. To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive
natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains,
wetlands, aquifers and their recharge areas, and agricultural lands, by
preserving and setting them aside from development;
7.1.8. To preserve historical and archaeological resources; and
7.1.9. To provide for the maintenance of open land set aside for active or passive
recreational use, or conservation lands.
7.1.10. To coordinate the creation of open space parcels that connect into larger
networks across the community.
7.2 PROCEDURES
Applications for a Special Permit for cluster development approval shall be made in
accordance with the procedures listed in Sections 2 and 3 of these regulations and
Section 3.16 of the Zoning Regulations.
7.3 PRELIMINARY PLAN MATERIALS
An applicant for cluster development is strongly encouraged to submit non-binding
Preliminary Plans to the Commission in accordance with Section 2 of these Regulations.
While not required, the Commission recommends submitting information for the Site
Context Plan, Existing Conditions Plan, Preferred Development Area Plan and Yield Plan
as listed below in Section 7.5 design. If the applicant chooses to present a Yield Plan at a
Preliminary Plan meeting (Section 2 of these regulations), the Commission shall discuss
the basic maximum number of lots/dwelling units. This initial determination shall not be
binding upon the Commission or applicant, but shall provide guidance and direction to
49 Town of Waterford, CT
the applicant regarding the maximum number of lots or dwelling units that appear to be
feasible, taking into account the physical constraints to development present on the
site. The applicant is encouraged to use this initial determination as the basis for
submission of more detailed information during subsequent stages of review.
7.4 FINAL PLAN MATERIALS
An applicant for cluster subdivision shall submit materials in accordance with the
application checklists associated specifically with cluster development attached as
Appendix A to these regulations. These checklists are designed to facilitate the design
process provided in Section 7.5 of these regulations and to provide information required
by the Commission in order to render a decision. These plan requirements are designed
specifically for cluster subdivision and shall be used instead of the requirements listed in
Section 4 of these regulations. These plans include:
7.4.1. Site Context Plan  The purpose of this plan is to provide the geographic and
planning context of the site and the surrounding environs.
7.4.2. Existing Conditions Plan  The purpose of this plan is to provide a
comprehensive inventory of the physical opportunities and constraints that
will eventually serve to shape the design of the cluster development.
Conditions beyond the parcel boundaries may be described on the basis of
existing published data available from governmental agencies, and from aerial
photographs.
7.4.3. Preferred Development Area Plan  The purpose of this plan is to combine all
of the resources identified in the Existing Conditions Plan into clearly
demarcated areas that make it easy to distinguish the location of priority
conservation areas in an aggregated manner. The Commission shall review the
map to assess its accuracy, conformance with municipal regulations, and likely
impact upon the natural and cultural resources on the property. The area of
land unencumbered by these resources is considered the preferred
development area.
7.4.4. Yield Plan  The purpose of this plan is to determine the basic maximum
number of lots that could be developed under the regulations that govern
conventional subdivisions in accordance with Section 5.3 of these regulations
and Section 3.34 of the Zoning Regulations. This plan shall be prepared by the
applicant as conceptual layout plans in accordance with the applicable Cluster
Development checklist. Although the yield plan must be drawn to scale, it need
not be based on a field survey. Upon further investigation and upon receipt of
more detailed soils and environmental information as may be provided in
subsequent stages of review, the Commission may increase or reduce the
number of lots/dwelling units contained in the initial basic maximum number.
7.4.5. Proposed Cluster Plan Set  The purpose of this plan is to transition from the
conceptual Cluster Sketch Plan to a fully engineered subdivision design that
meets the design requirements of these regulations. Lot sizes and other bulk
50 Town of Waterford, CT
requirements shall be in accordance with Section 3.16.3 of the Zoning
Regulations.
7.4.6. Supplementary Information  The purpose of this submittal is to provide
narrative information or other documentation that substantiates the
information on site plans.
7.4.7. Supporting Materials  The purpose of this submittal is to ensure the Town has
information regarding other permits, utilities, encumbrances, and similar
issues.
7.5 DESIGN PROCESS
At the time of the application for a cluster subdivision, applicants shall demonstrate to
the Commission that the following design process was used by a multidisciplinary team
of qualified professionals to determine the layout of proposed streets, house lots, unit
placement if treated as a condominium, including designation of all common areas and
open space.
7.5.1. Identifying Conservation Areas. The preferred developable area of the site
shall consist of land that does not include these conservation areas.
7.5.2. Locating House Sites. Locate the approximate sites of individual houses within
the preferred developable area to the maximum extent practicable and include
the delineation of private yards and shared amenities, so as to reflect an
integrated neighborhood design.
7.5.3. Buffering. Identify areas where vegetation should be preserved or installed to
protect existing or future adjacent development from impacts related to the
conservation development.+
7.5.4. Aligning the Streets and Trails. Align streets in order to access the house lots
or units. Additionally, new trails should be laid out to create internal and
external connections to existing and/or potential future streets, sidewalks, and
open space networks and trails.
7.5.5. Lot Lines. Draw in the property lot lines for each unit, using conceptual lot lines
to demonstrate compliance with dimensional standards where the ownership
is in condominium, cooperative, or other similar form of common ownership.
7.6 TYPES AND LOCATION OF BUILDINGS
7.6.1. For the purposes of determining compliance with the basic maximum number,
a single-family dwelling, whether attached or detached, shall be counted as
one dwelling or unit.
7.6.2. Lots having reduced area or frontage shall not have frontage on a street other
than on a street created by the cluster development. Lots having reduced
areas may be allowed on existing roads, provided that each lot fronting on an
existing road meets the frontage, front, and side yard setbacks in the zone
district.
51 Town of Waterford, CT
7.7 BUILDING DESIGN
Housing typologies selected for cluster development shall be generally consistent with
residential development patterns in Waterford and traditional New England styles.
Bungalow, Cape Cod, Colonial, Cottage, Craftsman, Victorian, and other similar
traditional styles shall be used to create a common architectural theme along cluster
subdivision streets. Individual homes shall be designed in a manner that shows
architectural variation within the broader theme established along individual streets.
The same house model shall not be repeated on individual dwelling units for more than
twenty (20) percent of the total dwelling units in a cluster housing development.
Dwelling units with the same combination of features and treatments shall not be
located adjacent to each other. The applicant shall provide architectural plans
demonstrating conformance with above styles and placement within the proposed
subdivision.
7.8 OPEN SPACE CREATED AS PART OF THE SUBDIVISION
In considering the efficacy of the open space in meeting the goals and objectives of the
POCD, the Commission shall consider the following:
7.8.1. The amount of open space included in the cluster subdivision shall comply with
Section 3.16 of the Zoning Regulations.
7.8.2. Open space created as part of the cluster subdivision process may contain uses
as allowed in Section 3.16 of the Zoning Regulations.
7.8.3. The composition of open space shall comply with Section 5.4 of these
Subdivision Regulations.
7.8.4. Ownership of open space shall comply with Section 6.12 of these regulations.
7.8.5. Open space shall be contiguous with existing open space that abuts the cluster
subdivision whenever possible.
7.9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
7.9.1. The stormwater management system for a cluster development shall conform
to the town's subdivision regulations (Section 5.5), with particular attention to
protecting on-site resources through the use of Low Impact Development
techniques. Stormwater management facilities shall not count toward the
minimum required open space area.
52 Town of Waterford, CT

APPENDIX E: DECLARATION OF MAINTENANCE OBLIGATION FOR
STORMWATER BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
Declaration
WHEREAS, [Subdivider], hereinafter, the Declarant, has obtain approval of the [Subdivision],
hereinafter, the Subdivision, as shown on plans entitled, [Subdivision Plan title], hereinafter
the Subdivision Plans; and
WHEREAS, the Town of Waterford, acting by and through its Planning and Zoning Commission
and in consultation with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection,
has determined that the protection of both surface and subsurface water quality in the Town
requires that stormwater runoff from roofs, driveways, and other impervious surfaces be
treated before being discharged into streams, lakes, and wetlands; and
WHEREAS, treatment of stormwater from impervious surfaces is achieved by one of two
general methods: (1) impoundments on the surface of the ground that are planted with
vegetation, and that allow the contaminants in stormwater to be taken up by the vegetation,
immobilized by dense soils, and broken down by sunlight; and (2) structures located beneath
the ground that collect stormwater and allow it to seep into the ground, where it is purified by
filtration through the soil before reaching subsurface groundwater levels or surface waters; and
WHEREAS, the Subdivision Plans depict one or both of these stormwater treatment methods,
depending on the soil and groundwater conditions encountered on each lot; and
WHEREAS, each of these stormwater treatment systems require regular maintenance in order
to operate as designed; and
WHEREAS, failure of these stormwater treatment systems could result in damage to the lots in
the Subdivision, to downstream owners, and/or to waters that are used for domestic wells,
recreation, and wildlife habitat;
NOW THEREFORE, the Declarant creates the following obligations for the protection and
maintenance of the stormwater treatment systems on the lots in the Subdivision, which
obligations shall run with the land and be binding on the heirs, successors, and assigns of the
Declarant.
1. Protection and Maintenance of Stormwater Management Systems. No owner of a lot in the
Subdivision shall remove any subsurface stormwater treatment system, or sever, re-route, or
otherwise alter any drainage line leading to such system, nor take any other action which
prevents water from reaching such system and flowing through it as designed. Likewise, no
owner of a lot in the Subdivision shall remove any surface stormwater treatment system, or
regrade or fill the same, or sever, re-route, or otherwise alter any drainage line leading to such
system, nor take any other action which prevents water from reaching such system and flowing
through it as designed. Owners of lots with surface stormwater treatment systems shall control
the growth of trees or shrubs on or into any berm or other barrier which forms the
impoundment. No less than every two (2) years, the lot owner shall be remove accumulated
sediment, leaves, litter, or other material which may have accumulated within either surface or
subsurface stormwater treatment systems.
2. Access by Town in the Event of Default. In the event that any lot owner fails to maintain any
stormwater treatment system, or alters it so that it cannot operate as designed, the Town of
Waterford shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to enter onto such lot and perform
such repairs or maintenance to the stormwater treatment system as may be required to restore
it to proper operation. For this purpose, the Town shall have the right to enter onto any lot
with equipment and personnel sufficient to perform the work required, and to remove any
landscaping, accessory structures, fences, walls, or other obstacles which might prevent such
access. It is the duty of the owner to insure that a viable access to the stormwater treatment
system exists on the lot for normal maintenance and repair, and, in the event that the Town
performs such work due to the lot owners failure to do so, the Town shall have no obligation to
restore any disturbed areas, other than to rough grade and seed such areas. Before exercising
any access, maintenance, or repair rights under this paragraph, the Town shall provide written
notice at least thirty (30) days before such access, such notice to be by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and setting forth the work required to be done. If the lot owner performs
the specified work at its own cost and expense, and notifies the Town of its completion, the
Town shall not enter onto the lot unless such work has not been performed fully or correctly.
3. Lien to Secure Town Work in Event of Default. In the event that the Town of Waterford
performs maintenance, repairs, or other corrective action due to any action of the lot owner, or
the failure of the lot owner to perform the maintenance work described in this Declaration, the
lot owner shall reimburse the Town of Waterford for the cost of performing said work. The
Town shall notify the lot owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and setting forth the
work performed and the cost thereof. The lot owner shall pay said sum to the Town within
thirty (30) days of receipt. The Town may secure the payment of such reimbursement by a
filing a lien against the lot, indexed in the name of the record owner thereof.
4. Payment of Attorneys Fees. Any party to this Declaration may enforce the provisions
hereof against any other party in an action for compensatory damages, injunction, or such
other remedy as the conditions may indicate. In the event that any party to this Declaration
seeks to enforce its provisions, the non-prevailing party shall be liable to the prevailing party for
the prevailing partys reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, witness
fees, court entry fees, marshals fees, and transcription costs.

APPENDIX G: STORMWATER FACILITY DESIGN GUIDELINES
The following guidelines are provided as guidance material for applicants that must develop
stormwater treatment systems pursuant to the applicable Town of Waterford Regulations.
These guidelines are adapted from the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, other
state stormwater manuals that have applicable material, research from the University of New
Hampshires Stormwater Center, and other research. It is important to note that, particularly
for those practices adapted from the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, some of
the design elements have been changed to reflect more recent accepted best practices in
stormwater quality facility design. Applicants are strongly encouraged to read these guidelines
carefully.
These guidelines are designed to provide summaries of some of the most important aspects of
stormwater quality facility design to ensure engineers are working within a framework that
meets the Town of Waterfords goals. Importantly, these guidelines do not represent a
comprehensive technical document for stormwater facility design. Details related to
sequencing of facilities in treatment trains, maintenance schedules, specific calculations for
water quality treatment, water quantity management, and other technical items are not
addressed in this guidance. It is the responsibility of an applicant to ensure all of the necessary
information called for in Waterfords application checklists is provided.
Bioretention Systems
Bioretention systems are shallow landscaped depressions designed to manage and treat
stormwater runoff. Bioretention systems are a variation of a surface sand filter, where the sand
filtration media is replaced with a planted soil bed designed to remove pollutants through
physical and biological processes.
Figure 1: Bioretention System
Source: Adapted from Center for Watershed Protection, 2000.
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area
? The maximum contributing drainage area for most surface and underground filtering
practices is five acres.
Slopes and Head Requirements:
? Bioretention systems can be used on sites with slopes of six percent or less.
? Bioretention designs require at least two feet of head difference between the inlet and
outlet.
Soils
? Stormwater filtering systems that return filtered runoff to the conveyance system and
do not infiltrate into the ground can be used in almost any soil type.
? Bioretention designs that rely on infiltration can be used only when the soil infiltration
characteristics are appropriate.
Water Table
? At least three feet of separation shall occur between the bottom of the filter and the
seasonal high groundwater table.
Design Criteria
The design criteria presented in this section are applicable to bioretention systems.
Considerations for specific design variations are also included.
Pretreatment
? Pretreatment shall be provided to manage at least 25 percent of the water quality
volume and release it to the filter media over a 24-hour period.
? Where a sediment forebay is used for pretreatment, a length-to-width ratio of between
1.5:1 and 3:1 is recommended.
Design Volume
? Bioretention facilities should provide at least 75 percent of the water quality volume in
the practice (including pretreatment, storage above the filter bed, and in the filter
media voids) and be designed to completely drain in 24 hours or less.
Filter Bed
? Bioretention systems shall consist of the following treatment components: A 24 to 48
deep engineered planting soil bed (depending on requirements of proposed vegetation),
a surface mulch layer, and a 6 to 9 deep surface ponding area.
? Engineered planting soils shall consist of USDA loamy sand to sandy loam classification
and meet the following graduation: sand 85-88%, silt 8-12%, clay 0-2%, and organic
matter (in the form of leaf compost) 3-5%.
? If an underdrain system is needed, the system should consist of four-inch diameter or
larger PVC perforated pipes reinforced to withstand the weight of the overburden
(schedule 40 PVC or greater). Cleanouts should be provided at both ends of the main
collector pipe and extend to the surface of the filterbed.
? An impermeable liner (clay, geomembrane, or concrete) should be used for excavated
bioretention facilities when infiltration below the facility could result in groundwater
contamination.
Landscaping/Vegetation
? Use native plant species to the extent practicable. Where non-native species are
proposed, these shall be non-invasive.
? Planting of bioretention facilities with a grass cover is not allowed.
Winter Operation
? Where possible, the filter bed should extend below the frost line.
? Filters that receive significant road sand should be equipped with a larger pretreatment
sediment chamber or forebay.
Infiltration Practices
Stormwater infiltration practices are designed to capture stormwater runoff and infiltrate it into
the ground over a period of days.
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area: The maximum contributing drainage area for infiltration trenches should not
exceed two acres. The maximum contributing drainage area for infiltration basins should not
exceed ten acres.
Soils: Underlying soils should have a minimum infiltration rate of 0.5 inches per hour, as initially
determined from NRCS soil textural classifications, and subsequently confirmed by a field
investigation acceptable to the review authority.
Slopes: Infiltration basins are not recommended in areas with natural slopes greater than 15
percent, and should be located at least 50 feet from slopes greater than 15 percent, since steep
slopes can cause water leakage in the lower portions of the basin and may reduce infiltration
rates due to lateral water movement.
Water Table: The bottom of the infiltration facility should be located at least three feet above the
seasonal high water table or bedrock, as documented by onsite soil testing.
Miscellaneous: Infiltration practices should not be placed over fill materials and, except where
recommended by local or state health departments or by the Department of Energy and
Environmental Protection, should be located at least 75 feet away from:
? Drinking water supply wells
? Septic systems (any components)
? Surface water bodies
? Building foundations (at least 100 feet upgradient and at least 25 feet downgradient
from building foundations)

the case, water entering the infiltration system must have already
achieved water quality treatment standards.

Permeable Pavement
Permeable paving practices capture and temporarily store the water quality volume before
allowing it to infiltrate into the soil or conveying it to another stormwater practice.
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area
? Permeable pavements should only be used to manage precipitation that falls directly on the
permeable pavement area to protect the surface from clogging. Contributing drainage areas
should be kept to a minimum (i.e., runoff from upgradient impermeable or permeable surfaces
should be minimal).
Area of Application
? Permeable paving surfaces are best used in low traffic areas such as overflow parking,
residential driveways, sidewalks, plazas and courtyard areas. Areas with high amounts of
sediment particles and high traffic volumes may cause system failures. Should not construct
adjacent to areas subject to significant wind erosion.
? To protect groundwater from possible contamination, runoff from land uses or activities that
may generate high levels of pollution and/or hazards materials must not be directed to
permeable pavement unless designed as a detention facility (with an impermeable liner).
Groundwater
? The bottom of an infiltrating permeable pavement practice shall be separated by at least three
feet vertically from the seasonal high groundwater elevation or bedrock layer (when treating
water quality volume), as documented by on-site soil testing.

Design Criteria
There are two major types of permeable paving:
1. Porous asphalt and pervious concrete: Although they appear to be the same as traditional
asphalt or concrete pavement, they have 10%-25% void space and are constructed over a base
course that doubles as a reservoir for the stormwater before it infiltrates into the subsoil or is
directed to a downstream facility. A sample cross-section is provided for illustration purposes
only in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Example Cross-section of Porous Asphalt (UNHSC, 2009)
2. Pavers: Two alternative paver configurations will be acceptable to the approving agency as
water quality BMPs. These are as follows:
A. Permeable solid blocks or reinforced turf: This type of permeable paving surface includes
permeable solid blocks (where the blocks have a minimum void ratio of 15%) and contain
open-cell grids filled with washed aggregate (for paving blocks) or sandy soil and planted
with turf (for reinforced turf applications).
B. Solid blocks with open-cell joints: This type of paver surface includes interlocking
impermeable solid blocks or open grid cells that contain permeable void areas (between the
impermeable blocks).
A permeable pavement system can fall under one of two categories: An Infiltration Facility or a
Detention Facility. The infiltration restrictions noted in this section do not apply to Detention
Facilities.
? Use permeable paving only on gentle slopes (less than 5%).
? The bottom of infiltrating permeable pavement practices must be located in the soil profile.
Where a TMDL goal requires maximum treatment of runoff, the bottom shall be within the
uppermost soil horizons (A or B) or another stormwater management practice is required.
? To be suitable for infiltration, underlying soils shall have an in-situ infiltration rate of at least 0.5
inches per hour, as initially determined from NRCS soil textural classification, and subsequently
confirmed by field geotechnical tests.
? For infiltrating permeable paving practices, underlying soils shall also have a clay content of less
than 20% and a silt content of less than 60%.
? The bottom of an infiltrating permeable pavement practice cannot be located in fill with the
exception for strictly residential land uses, for which the bottom may be located in up to two
feet of fill consisting of material suitable for long-term infiltration.
? Permeable paving practices should be designed with an impermeable liner when used where
subsurface contamination is present from prior land use due to the increased threat of pollutant
migration associated with increased hydraulic loading from infiltration systems, unless
contaminated soil is removed and the site is remediated.
? All permeable pavement systems shall be designed to fully de-water the entire water quality
volume within 24 hours after the storm event.
? Install signage identifying areas with pervious pavement and prohibiting stockpiling of snow,
mulch, soil, or any other like materials.
Stormwater Wetlands
Stormwater wetlands are constructed wetlands that incorporate marsh areas and permanent pools
to provide enhanced treatment and attenuation of stormwater flows. Stormwater wetlands differ
from stormwater ponds in that wetland vegetation is a major element of the overall treatment
mechanism as opposed to a supplementary component. Stormwater wetlands are different from
Gravel Wetlands in that storage of water is generally on the surface with Stormwater Wetlands
and includes various levels of temporary ponding depending on design. Gravel wetlands rely
primarily on subsurface gravel media to store and convey stormwater horizontally.
Shallow Wetlands: Most shallow wetland systems, also referred to as shallow marsh wetlands,
consist of aquatic vegetation with a permanent pool ranging from 6 to 18 inches during normal
conditions. Shallow wetlands are designed such that flow through the wetlands is conveyed
uniformly across the treatment area. Figure 1 depicts a typical schematic design of a shallow
wetland.
Extended Detention Shallow Wetlands: Extended detention shallow wetlands provide a greater
degree of downstream channel protection as they are designed with more vertical storage
capacity. The additional vertical storage volume also provides extra runoff detention above the
normal pool elevations. Water levels in the extended detention shallow wetland may increase by
as much as three feet after a storm event and return gradually to pre-storm elevations within 24
hours of the storm event. Figure 2 depicts a typical schematic design of an extended detention
shallow wetland.
Pond/Wetland Systems: Multiple cell systems, such as pond/wetland systems, utilize at least
one pond component in conjunction with a shallow marsh component. The first cell is typically a
wet pond, which provides pretreatment of the runoff by removing particulate pollutants. The wet
pond is also used to reduce the velocity of the runoff entering the system. The shallow marsh
then polishes the runoff, particularly for soluble pollutants, prior to discharge. Figure 3 depicts a
typical schematic of a pond/wetland system.
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area
? A typical minimum drainage area is 25 acres unless the system intercepts groundwater or is
lined to maintain adequate minimum water levels.
? Stormwater wetland surface area must be minimum of 1.5% of contributing drainage area.
Groundwater and Soils
? Unlined wetland basins must: 1) intersect the groundwater table in order to maintain the
desired permanent pool volume; or 2) be lined with a geomembrane or soils; or 3) be already
comprised of soils that are suitable to maintaining the desired permanent pool.
Flood Zones
? Constructed stormwater wetlands shall not be located in floodways, floodplains, or tidal lands,
especially those that require construction of an embankment.
Receiving Waters
? The sensitivity of receiving waters should be evaluated to determine whether effects of warmer
stormwater discharges from the system could be detrimental to cold-water fish or other
sensitive aquatic species.
Natural Wetlands
? Natural wetlands and vernal pool depressions shall not be used, either temporarily or
permanently, as a stormwater wetland.
Design Criteria

? 50 feet from any steep slope (greater than 15%)
Preferred Shape Curvilinear
Side Slopes 3:1 maximum or flatter preferred
Pretreatment
Volume
Pretreatment is required for wetlands and shall be sized to contain at least
ten percent of the WQV. Where forebays are used, a minimum
length:width ratio of 2:1 shall be applied.
Treatment Volume 100% of the entire Water Quality Volume (WQV) shall be treated.
Drainage Area Minimum contributing drainage area is 25 acres unless system intercepts
groundwater or is lined to maintain wetland hydrology and permanent
pool.
Underlying Soils Low permeability soils are best (NRCS Hydrologic Soil Group A and B
soils require modifications to maintain a wetland unless groundwater is
intercepted).
Plantings The system should be planted to achieve a dense cover of emergent wetland
vegetation on the bench, shelf and in shallow marsh areas with appropriate
native wetland vegetation.
Depth Average water levels in the marsh/wetland areas can vary between 0.5
and 1.5 feet. Maximum water depths will depend on the site topography
and the design of the system. Forebays and micropools should typically
have a permanent pool depth of between four and six feet.
Low Flow Orifice A low flow orifice shall be provided, sized and protected to prevent
clogging.
Outlet Protection Outlet protection is required to reduce flow velocities and prevent
erosion. An armored emergency spillway is required to pass flood flows.
Maintenance Access:
? A maintenance right-of-way or easement shall extend from a public right of way and should be
designed to allow access to all components of the facility.
? Maintenance access should be at least 15 feet wide, have a maximum slope of no more than 15
percent, and be appropriately stabilized to withstand maintenance equipment and vehicles.
? Provisions for vehicle turnaround shall only be needed where backing a vehicle back onto the
public way would be hazardous due to steeper slopes or limited sight lines.

Figure 2: Extended Detention Shallow Wetland
Figure 3: Pond/Wetland System
Subsurface Gravel Wetland
A subsurface gravel wetland (SGW) is designed as a series of horizontal flow-through treatment
cells, preceded by a sedimentation basin (forebay). Two schematic options for SGW design are
provided below. The SGW is designed as flow through treatment, where the stormwater passes
through a gravel substrate that is a microbe rich environment.
Siting Considerations
Groundwater and Soils
? The wetlands cell soils should maintain saturation below a depth of four inches (10 cm) from the
ground surface in order to both promote water quality treatment conditions and support
wetland vegetation.
? Unlined wetlands must either intersect the groundwater table in order to maintain the desired
vegetation or be comprised of soils that are suitable to maintaining the desired hydrology and
vegetation.
Flood Zones
? Gravel wetlands shall not be located in floodways, floodplains, or tidal lands, especially those
that require construction of an embankment.
Natural Wetlands
? Natural wetlands and vernal pool depressions shall not be used, either temporarily or
permanently, as a gravel wetland.

Pretreatment
Volume
Forebays are highly recommended for wetlands and sized to contain ten
percent of the WQV.
Treatment Volume Manage the entire WQV. At least 10% of the WQv shall be provided in a
sediment forebay or other pretreatment practice. The remaining 90% of the
WQv may be provided in some combination of one or more basins filled with
gravel and extended detention storage above the gravel. Extended detention
storage volume shall not exceed 50% of the WQv and shall drain over 24 hours.
Underlying Soils Low permeability soils are best with recommended hydraulic
conductivity of <0.03 ft/day. (NRCS Hydrologic Soil Group A and B
soils require modifications to maintain a wetland unless groundwater is
intercepted).
Plantings The system should be planted to achieve a rigorous root mat with grasses,
forbs, and shrubs with obligate and facultative wetland species.

Water Quality Swales
Water quality swales are vegetated open channels designed to treat and attenuate the water
quality volume and convey excess stormwater runoff. This section includes two types of water
quality swales:
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area
? The maximum contributing drainage area for water quality swales should be limited to
five acres.
Slopes
? Site topography should allow for the design of a swale with sufficient slope and crosssectional
area to maintain non-erosive velocities. In areas of steep slopes, swales should
run parallel to contours.
Soils and Water Table:
? Dry swales can be sited on most moderately or well-drained soils. The bottom of the
swale should be two to four feet above the seasonal high water table.
? Wet swales should only be used where the water table is at or near the soil surface or
where soil types are poorly drained.
Design Criteria
Parameter Design Criteria
Pretreatment Volume 25% of the water quality volume (WQV) shall be captured for pre-treatment using a
sediment forebay, underground chamber or other method suitable to the conditions on-site
and for the intended use.
Preferred Shape Trapezoidal or parabolic
Bottom Width Four feet minimum recommended for maintenance, eight feet maximum, widths up to 16
feet are allowable if a dividing berm or structure is used
Side Slopes 3(h):1(v) maximum, 4:1 or flatter recommended for maintenance
Longitudinal Slope Dry Swale: Up to 2% without check dams. Check dams may be used for steeper slopes to
achieve the appropriate storage volumes in separate cells and control flow velocity.
Wet Swale: Less than 1%
Sizing Criteria Length, width, depth, and slope needed to provide surface storage for the WQV.
Dry Swale: Maximum ponding time of 24 hours
Wet Swale: retain the WQV for 24 hours; ponding may continue longer
Underlying Soil Bed Dry Swale: Permeable soil layer shall be an engineered media that consists of USDA loamy
sand to sandy loam classification and meets the following gradation: sand 85-88%, silt 8-
12%, clay 0-2%, and organic matter (in the form of leaf compost) 3-5%. Underdrains may
be required depending on underlying native soils and groundwater table.
Wet Swale: undisturbed soils, no underdrain system
Depth and Capacity ? Surface storage of WQV with a maximum ponding depth of 18 inches
? Safely convey 2-year storm with non-erosive velocity
? Adequate capacity for 10-year storm with six inches of freeboard
Source: Adapted from Claytor and Schueler, 1996.
Vegetation
? Dry swale vegetation should be designed for periodic mowing.
? Wetland species shall be used for the bottom of a wet swale.
? Native species are preferred for enhanced biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and drought
tolerance.
? The maximum velocity should not exceed erosive velocities for the soil type and
vegetation condition of the channel (see Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control for maximum permissible velocities).

Wet Extended Detention Pond
Stormwater ponds are vegetated ponds that retain a permanent pool of water and are constructed
to provide both treatment and attenuation of stormwater flows. The design of wet extended
detention ponds is focused on attenuating peak runoff flows. As a result, more storage volume is
committed to managing peak flows as opposed to maximizing the wet pool depth. The
configuration of the outfall structure provides additional storage volume above the level of the
permanent pool (Figure 1).
Siting Considerations
Drainage Area
? Typical minimum drainage area is 25 acres. May be varied where minimum depth of water will
be maintained.
Groundwater
? Unlined basins must intersect the groundwater table in order to maintain the desired
permanent pool.
Baseflow:
? A small amount of baseflow is desirable to maintain circulation and reduce the potential for low
dissolved oxygen levels during late summer.
? Baseflow can be provided by groundwater infiltrating into either the basin or the collection
system above the pond.
Site Slopes
? Steep on-site slopes may result in the need for a large embankment to be constructed to
provide the desired storage volume, which could require a dam construction permit from the
Connecticut DEEP.
Receiving Waters
? The sensitivity of receiving waters should be evaluated to determine whether the effects of the
warmer stormwater discharges from the wet pond could be detrimental to cold water fish or
other sensitive aquatic species.
Flood Zones
? Ponds shall not be located in floodways, floodplains, or tidal lands, especially those that require
construction of an embankment.
Natural Wetlands/Vernal Pools
? Natural wetlands and vernal pool depressions shall not be used, either temporarily or
permanently, as a stormwater pond or wetland.
? Stormwater ponds should be located at least 750 feet from a vernal pool and shall not be sited
between vernal pools, or in areas that are known primary amphibian overland migration routes.

Pretreatment
Volume
Forebays are highly recommended for wet ponds and shall be sized to
contain 10% of the WQV.
Pond Volume 100% WQV treatment must be provided with a combination of
pretreatment, permanent pool volume, and extended detention. Extended
detention shall be less than or equal to 50% of the WQV.
Drainage Area Minimum contributing drainage area is ten acres for extended detention
basins.
Underlying Soils Low permeability soils are best (NRCS Hydrologic Soil Group A and B
soils require modifications to maintain a permanent pool unless
groundwater is intercepted).
Capacity The minimum ratio of pool volume to runoff volume must be greater than
2:1 and preferably 4:1. A 4:1 ratio provides 85-90% sediment removal
based on a residence time of two weeks.
Depth ? An average pool depth of three to six feet is recommended and varying
depths in the pond are preferred.
? The aquatic bench should be 12-18 inches deep.
? Ponds should not be greater than eight feet deep.
Forebay
? A sediment forebay shall be sized to contain at least ten percent of the WQV and be of an
adequate depth to prevent resuspension of collected sediments during the design storm, often
being four to six feet deep. The goal of the forebay is to remove particles consistent with the
size of medium sand. The forebay storage volume may be used to fulfill the total WQV
requirement of this system. The forebay must also include additional sediment storage volume
that may not be used for WQV calculations.
? Direct access for appropriate maintenance equipment should be provided to the forebay.
Wet Pool
? Stormwater pond design shall provide water quality treatment storage to capture the computed
WQV from the contributing drainage area in the proposed forebay, permanent pool, extended
detention area, and marsh. The division of storage between the permanent pool and extended
detention is 50 percent minimum in permanent pool and 50 percent maximum in extended
detention pond.
? Provide variable pond depths of four to six feet but not exceeding depths of eight feet.
? Maintain pond water quality sufficient to support mosquito-feeding fish where practicable.
Pond Vegetation
? Wetland plantings should be used in a pond design, either along the aquatic bench (fringe
wetlands), the safety bench and side slopes, or within shallow areas of the pool.

SECTION 1 - TITLE, AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
1.1 These regulations shall be known as "The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Regulations of the Town of Waterford".
1.2 The Conservation Commission of the Town of Waterford was established in
accordance with Chapter 2.52, of the Waterford Code of Ordinances adopted on April
2, 1973,and Chapter 5.3 of the Charter of the Town of Waterford as revised to
December 8, 1983 and authorized to implement the purposes and provisions of the
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of Waterford pursuant to Chapter
2.52 of the Waterford Code of Ordinances.
1.3 These Regulations have been adopted by the Conservation Commission and may be
amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands
and Watercourses Act, Section 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the CofuJ.ecticut
General Statutes as authorized by the Representative Town Meeting of the Town of
Waterford in Chapter 2.52 of the Waterford Code of Ordinances.
1.4 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an
indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of
the State have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web
of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to
hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and
purification of the groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal,
aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetland and watercourses have been destroyed or
are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition,
filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection
of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated
wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to
have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the State of
Connecticut and has and continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus
adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and
benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more.
The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random,
unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the
public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the
state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the
state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of
the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution;
maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set
by federal, State or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or
siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and
vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting
the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses
for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private
uses and values; and protecting the State's potable fresh water supplies from the
dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an
orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use
of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever
guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their
benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
L5 The Commission shall enforce all provisions of the Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Act and shall issue, issue with terms, conditions, limitations or
modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in the Town of Waterford
pursuant to Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes,
as amended.

21
SECTION 10: CONSIDERATIONS FOR DECISION
10.1 The Commission shall consider the following in making its decision on an
application:
a. The application and its supporting documentation;
b. Public comments, evidence, and testimony from a public hearing;
c. Reports from other agencies and commissions or town staff including but not
limited to the Town of Waterford:
1. Planning & Zoning Commission
2. Flood and Erosion Control Board
3. Water Pollution Control Authority
4. Environmental Planner, Town Planner, Zoning Enforcement Officer,
Town Engineer, Health Official, or Building Official.
d. The Commission may also consider comments on any application from the New
London County Soil and Water Conservation District, City of New London Water
Department, the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Planning Agency or other
regional organizations (i.e. Council of Elected Officials), agencies in adjacent
municipalities which may be affected by the proposed activity, State or Federal
Agencies, professional consultants, or other technical agencies or organizations
which may undertake additional studies or investigations.
Non-receipt of comments as listed in 10.1.c and 10.1.d of these Regulations within
the prescribed time shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Commission.
10.2 Standards and Criteria for Decision:
In carrying out the purposes and policies of Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive,
including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions
thereof, the Conservation Commission shall take into consideration all relevant facts
and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands and
watercourses, including the effects on the capacity of the inland wetland and
watercourse to support fish and wildlife, to prevent flooding, to supply and protect
surface and ground-waters, to control sediment, to facilitate drainage, to control
pollution, to support recreational activities, and to promote public health and
safety.
b. The applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to the
proposed regulated activity, which alternatives would cause less or no
environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
22
c. The relationship between the short-term and long-term impacts of the proposed
regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and
enhancement of long-tenn productivity of such wetlands or watercourses,
including consideration of the extent to which the proposed activity involves
tradeoffs between short-term environmental gains at the expense of long-term
losses, or vice versa, and consideration of the extent to which the proposed action
forecloses or predetermines future options.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which
would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which
such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such
resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition
of permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (l) prevent or
minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance
existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore,
enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources.
This requires recognition that the inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of
Connecticut are an indispensable, irreplaceable, and fragile natural resource, and
that these areas may be irreversibly destroyed by deposition, filling, or removal of
material, by the diversion, diminution, or obstruction of water flow, including low
flows, and by the erection of structures and other uses.
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health, or the
reasonable use of property, including abutting or downstream property which
would be caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity, or the creation
of conditions which may do so. This includes recognition of potential damage
from erosion, turbidity, or siltation; loss of fish and wildlife and their habitat; loss
of unique habitat, loss of habitat having natural, scientific, or educational value;
loss or diminution of beneficial aquatic organisms and wetland plants; the dangers
of flooding and pollution; and the destruction of economic, aesthetic, recreational,
and other public and private uses and values of wetlands and watercourses to the
community.
f. The impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses
outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated
with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made
inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on
wetlands or watercourses.
g. Measures which would mitigate the impact of any aspect of the proposed
regulated activity(ies). Such measures include, but are not limited to, actions
which would avoid adverse impacts or lessen impacts to wetlands and
watercourses and which could be feasibly carried out by the applicant and would
protect the natural capacity of the wetland or watercourse to support fish and
wildlife, prevent flooding, supply water, control sedimentation, prevent erosion,
assimilate wastes, facilitate drainage, and to provide recreation and open space.
23
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by
the Conservation Commission that the proposed activity may have a significant
impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the
Commission finds, on the basis of the record, that a feasible and prudent alternative
does not exist. In making this finding, the Commission shall consider the facts and
circumstances set forth in Section 10.2 of these Regulations. The finding and the
reasons therefore, shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may
be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less
adverse impacts on wetlands or watercourses, the Commission shall propose on the
record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate
provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant
to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed
regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) "wetlands or watercourse" includes aquatic, plant or
animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) "habitats" means areas
or environments in which an organism or biological population nonnally lives or
occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands agency shall not deny or condition an application for a
regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an
impact or effect on aquatic, plant or animal life unless such activity will likely impact
or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10. 7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Commission
shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other
material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Commission in this
decision. However, the commission is not precluded from seeking advice from its
staff or agents on information already in the record of the public hearing.
A conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a
presumption that a permit should be issued. The applicant has the burden of
demonstrating that his application is consistent with the purposes and policies of these
regulations and Sections 22a-36 through 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut
General Statutes.
l 0. 8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant
to subsection 7.7c of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide proof
to the inland wetlands agency that granting of the permit application will violate the
terms of the restriction. Upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms
of such restriction, the inland wetlands agency shall not grant the permit approval.
10.9 In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions
of subsection 7.7c or 7.7d of these regulations, (1) the party holding the conservation
or preservation restriction, other than a state agency that holds such restriction, may,
24
not later than 15 days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal
with the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency
relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall reverse the permit approval
upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction; or (2)
the state agency that holds such restriction may, not later than thirty days after receipt
of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands agency,
subject to the rules and regulations of such agency relating to appeals. The inland
wetlands agency shall immediately reverse such permit approval if the commissioner
of the state agency that holds such restriction certifies that the land use authorized in
such pennit violates the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
10.10 Nothing in subsections 7.7c or 7.7d of these regulations shall be construed to prohibit
the filing of a permit application or to require such written notice when the activity
that is the subject of such permit application will occur on a portion of property that is
not restricted under the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
25
SECTION 11 - DECISION PROCESS AND PERMIT ISSUANCE

written permission of the Commission.
11. 8 If a bond or insurance is required in accordance with Section 13 of these Regulations,
the Commission may withhold issuing the permit until such bond or insurance is
provided. No authorization to proceed with any regulated activity shall be given
until such bond or insurance is provided. Authorization shall consist of release of
signed Conservation Permit and site plan by the Planning Department and written
notification to proceed by the Environmental Planner.
11.9 General provisions in the issuance of all permits:
a. In evaluating applications, in which the Commission has relied in whole or in part
on information provided by the applicant, if such information subsequently proves
