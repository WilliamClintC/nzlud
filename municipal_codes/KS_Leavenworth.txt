Any member who declares a conflict of interest must state, for the purpose of its inclusion in the minutes, the reason for the conflict of interest and step down from the dais. This action does not result in a vote being recorded for the member declaring a conflict of interest. 
(d)  Votes; non-ordinance matters. Unless otherwise specifically required by law, the adoption or rejection of resolutions and other motions shall be by a majority of those present. Any member who abstains from voting for any reason other than set in subsection (c) of this section shall be counted as having voted against the motion.

Shall be amended as follows: 
406.1 General. Prior to acceptance and initial operation, and on any piping system that has not been in operation for one year or longer, all piping installations shall be inspected and pressure tested to determine that the materials, design, fabrication, and installation practices comply with the requirements of this code. 
406.1.1 Inspections. Inspection shall consist of visual examination, during or after manufacture, fabrication, assembly, or pressure tests as appropriate. Supplementary types of nondestructive inspection techniques, such as magnetic-particle, radiographic, ultrasonic, etc., shall not be required unless specifically listed herein or in the engineering design. 
406.1.2 Repairs and additions. In the event repairs or additions are made after the pressure test, the affected piping shall be tested. 
Minor repairs and additions are not required to be pressure tested, provided that the work is inspected and connections are tested with a noncorrosive leak-detecting fluid or other approved leak-detecting methods. 
406.1.3 New branches. Where new branches are installed to new appliances, only the newly installed branches shall be required to be pressure tested. Connections between the new piping and the existing piping shall be tested with a noncorrosive leak-detecting fluid or other approved leak-detecting methods. 
406.1.4 Section testing. A piping system shall be permitted to be tested as a complete unit or in sections. Under no circumstances shall a valve in a line be used as a bulkhead between gas in one section of the piping system and test medium in an adjacent section, unless two valves are installed in series with a valved "tell-tale" located between these valves. A valve shall not be subjected to the test pressure unless it can be determined that the valve, including the valve-closing mechanism, is designed to safely withstand the test pressure. 
406.1.5 Regulators and valve assemblies. Regulator and valve assemblies fabricated independently of the piping system in which they are to be installed shall be permitted to be tested with inert gas or air at the time of fabrication.

Shall be amended as follows: 
406.4 Test pressure measurement. Test pressure shall be measured with a manometer or with a pressure-measuring device designed and calibrated to read, record, or indicate a pressure loss caused by leakage during the pressure test period. The source of pressure shall be isolated before the pressure tests are made. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures shall have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. 
406.4.1 Test pressure. The test pressure to be used shall be no less than 1½ times the proposed maximum working pressure, but not less than 20 psig (138 kPa gauge), irrespective of design pressure. Where the test pressure exceeds 125 psig (862 kPa gauge), the test pressure shall not exceed a value that produces a hoop stress in the piping greater than 50 percent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe. 
Test duration. Test duration shall be not less than V 2 hour for each 500 cubic feet (14 m 3 ) of pipe volume or fraction thereof. When testing a system having a volume less than ten cubic feet (0.28 m 3 ) or a system in a single-family dwelling, the test duration shall be not less than 15 minutes. The duration of the test shall not be required to exceed 24 hours.

ARTICLE IX. - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
 
Sec. 10-444. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to provide for enforcement of property maintenance standards which are considered essential to health and sanitation, but their violation would not necessarily make a home unfit for continued occupancy. Each standard enumerated herein is a minimum order of law. Persons are encouraged to maintain their properties to higher standards. 
(Code 1994, § 22-801; Ord. No. 7370, § 1, 7-28-1998)  
Sec. 10-445. - Definitions. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Designated public official means the department head or other person designated by the city manager to enforce this article. The present designated public official is the zoning administrator, community development department. All officers of the city including code enforcement, law enforcement and building inspection personnel may report violations to this person who shall investigate and determine appropriate action. Citizens are also encouraged to report violations of this Code to the designated public official. 
Structure means any manmade, above grade building or appurtenance used for shelter, storage or any service purpose. 
Undeveloped properties or vacant lots means any parcel of ground on which no structure exists. 
(b)  Interpretations. 
(1)  Compatible color and materials. The designated enforcement officer shall use judgment to determine which materials may be compatible with existing materials in correcting deficiencies. Obviously, if deficient siding is white vinyl and the remaining siding is white vinyl, then the occupant/owner may use white vinyl siding to make the repair. If, however, the property owner desires to use a contrasting color or material in a manner harmonious with existing color and material schemes, the designated enforcement officer may authorize the change based upon the occupant/owner's rationale and in keeping with neighborhood standards. 
(2)  Compliance with orders. All orders enumerated in this article shall be performed by the occupant or property owner. 
(3)  Draining pooled water. The occupant/owner shall drain any pooled water to the street gutter or ditch line perpendicular to the impoundment and shall not cause such water to drain or course across any adjacent property. Methods to accomplish this may include filling the impound area with material compatible to the surrounding area (earth/grass in lawn areas, asphalt/concrete in drive and walk way areas, etc.) or to trench or tube a drain line from the low spot to the street gutter/ditch. 
(4)  Paint standard. The designated enforcement officer shall use judgment to determine when the paint standard is not being met by the occupant or property owner. In most cases, the paint standard is intended to apply to structures and appurtenances which clearly exceed this minimum standard. Any exterior surface subject to the paint standard may be measured with occupant/owner permission to determine if more than 25 percent of any surface is deficient. If no permission is granted, the officer shall perform the following: from aerial photographs, scale the width and length dimensions. From common reference points with known heights (utility poles, street signs, standard gutter, board, and other material widths and heights), estimate remaining dimensions.

If the hearings officer determines that more than 12 false alarms have occurred and that the user has not taken action which substantially reduces the likelihood of false alarms, he shall issue written findings to that effect and uphold the chief's action for permit revocation. If the hearing officer determines the user has taken action that will reduce the likelihood of false alarms, the user will retain the alarm user's permit and the hearing officer may reduce the number of false alarms charged against the user. 
(f)  When the police department or fire department has responded to any alarm sound, signal or message emitted or transmitted from or by an alarm system or proprietor alarm, the permit for which has been suspended or revoked, or for which there was not previously issued a permit in accordance with this article, or for which six or more false alarms have occurred in the last 12-month period, the police chief shall promptly transmit a report of appropriate fees to the city clerk, together with an appropriate report relating the facts and circumstances concerning the incident to which the report of fees relates.

(g)  If any billing under this section is not paid within 60 days, an action may be brought for collection of any amounts due. Permits shall not be renewed if unpaid response or permit filing fees exist.

Sec. 18-195. - Backfilling, topping and paving; work to be performed by contractor; notice required. 
All backfilling, topping or paving in any street, alley, sidewalk or public ground shall be done by the company making the excavation. The inspection office shall be notified of the location of all cuts prior to their being made and shall be informed when backfilling operations are ready to begin. 
(Code 1978, § 32-118; Code 1994, § 102-290)  
Sec. 18-196. - Materials and procedure. 
The following specifications shall apply to excavations made under this article: 
(1)  AB-3 is to be used for backfill up to the lower surface of the existing surface materials. The AB-3 shall be placed in successive lifts of not more than 12 inches and each lift is to be compacted by mechanical means. The AB-3 is to contain moisture sufficient to result in a finished base equal to or greater than the density of the adjacent material. 
(2)  Surfacing is to be placed 12 inches minimum on each side of a trench including the beginning and ending of trenches. 
(3)  On all curbed and guttered streets, regardless of existing surface, the street cut shall be filled with 3,000 psi concrete to a minimum depth of six inches or from the base of the original pavement, whichever is the greater. The concrete shall be flat-finished and neatly edged. Seal coat surfacings shall be replaced with a minimum of six inches of asphalt. Hot mix asphalt shall be used when available. If seasonal or availability conditions warrant, cold mix asphalt may be used provided the cold mix equals the hot mix density. Rock or gravel roads and alleys are to be backfilled with AB-3 compacted to a density equal to or greater than the adjacent undisturbed area, then covered with road rock that equals the original surface in size. 
(4)  Asphalt, asphalt-brick combination and concrete are to be saw cut to neat lines. The saw cut may be made when the cut is filled and is not required to be done at the time the cut is opened. 
(5)  All finished surfaces are to be checked with a straight edge or string line at the time of finishing or tamping of the asphalt. 
(6)  Excavations under sidewalks are to be backfilled with AB-3 and thoroughly tamped to achieve a density to prevent settlement. 
(7)  Excavations extending back of the curbline or beyond the ditch line of gravel or seal coated streets shall be backfilled with the material from the excavation and, further, the initial four feet shall be backfilled in six-inch lifts and tamped to 95 percent of optimum density using the standard proctor test as performed by a commercial testing laboratory. Wet material that will not meet optimum moisture density shall be modified by the addition of four percent of hydrated or quick lime by volume. Existing ground cover is to be replaced by either stockpiled sod or freshly cut sod or seeding and fertilizer as may be approved by the director of public works or his designated representative when the backfill is completed. Sodding or seeding is expected to be completed during the same day or the next working day. Backfill with frozen dirt may be done with the explicit understanding that the trench fill material is to be re-excavated and tamped when the ground thaws. If the inspection office declares that an excavation appears not to be meeting this standard, the contractor may elect the following: 
a.  To have a minimum of two Shelby tube samples taken in the finished excavation to determine the in-place density to be compared to an adjacent undisturbed sample. If the compacted materials fail to equal or exceed the level of adjacent soil density values, in the opinion of the commercial testing laboratory, then the contractor will remove and replace all the trench fill materials. The building inspector or designated representative shall be sole judge of the quality of the fill. 
b.  Replace the fill in its entirety to the heretofore enumerated standards. 
(8)  All service cut trenches are to have a minimum width of 18 inches.

Sec. 20-54. - Regulations for the use of air curtain open pit destructors. 
(a)  Generally. Permit applications for the burning of land clearing debris, including trees, brush and vegetation only shall normally be considered as being necessary and in the public interest, providing that an air curtain open pit destructor of suitable design and capacity is used to accomplish the burning and, further, providing that such a device is installed, maintained and operated at maximum efficiency. Each such application, however, shall be considered individually upon its merits and the fire chief or his designee may decide that other factors require that such permit applications be denied. 
(b)  Burning permits. Air curtain open pit destructors can only be used to burn trees and brush. They cannot be used to burn construction waste, demolition debris or other waste material. Any person intending to use an air curtain open pit destructor to burn trees or brush must apply to the fire department at least three working days prior to the intended start date. 
(1)  The application must include a site plan, including distances to the nearest structures and the location of the pit. 
(2)  The fire chief or his designee shall make the decision to require a fire to be extinguished if complaint is received. 
(3)  No permit shall be issued for a site that is less than 500 feet from an inhabited structure nor less than 250 feet from a vacant structure. 
(4)  Burning shall only be allowed on days when the cloud cover does not exceed a factor of 0.7 in accordance with National Weather Bureau Standards. 
(5)  Burning shall only be allowed on days when the wind speed is less than 15 mph, as determined by the fire chief or his designee. 
(6)  Burning shall be allowed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and one-half hour before sunset. No materials shall be added to the pit less than two hours before sunset. Any material still burning one-half hour before sunset shall be extinguished by filling the pit with dirt or completely extinguishing with water. 
(7)  Each permit issued under this section shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days. 
(8)  A separate application and permit is required for each job site on which an air curtain open pit destructor is used. Each application is considered individually upon its merits. In addition to those factors discussed under subsection (a) of this section, other factors may require that a specific permit application be denied. 
(9)  Each permit issued is accompanied by a copy of FDR-01-94, which contains required operating conditions and may include but may not be limited to the requirements and guidelines as set out in subsections (c) through (g) of this section. 
(10)  The fire department shall be notified each time the burner is going to be used by calling the number enclosed in the informational package. 
(c)  Design requirements. Air curtain open pit destructors proposed for use in the city must meet the following design guidelines in order to accomplish minimum emission burning: 
(1)  The pit should be the exact length of the nozzle-equipped air blowing plenum-manifold, less than ten feet across (preferably eight feet or less across), 12 feet or deeper, consistent with local soil conditions, and have all four sides smooth and vertical. 
(2)  The blower or fan selected should be capable of delivering an air velocity of at least 150 feet per second through nozzles designed to deliver a flat sheet or curtain of air blowing diagonally downward across the entire pit. 
(3)  Carefully examine the guideline diagram (on file with the city clerk) for pit construction and configuration of an air curtain open pit destructor. 
(d)  General operation. Operations of air curtain open pit destructors shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and FDR-01-94; if there is a conflict, the manufacturer's instructions shall be followed. 
(1)  Construction and placement of the pit as well as actual set-up of the air curtain open pit destructor itself must be approved by the fire chief or his designee before burning begins. 
(2)  The fire chief or his designee will also make spot check inspections during operation to ensure that everything possible is being done to minimize smoke and other emissions, that the operator is complying with all conditions of the permit, and that the burning is not causing a local nuisance or safety problem. 
(3)  Failure to comply with the terms of the permit or causing or contributing to significant nuisance, air pollution, or safety problems may compel revocation of the permit. 
(4)  Operator must do everything possible to minimize smoke, sparks and embers, fly ash and other emissions from the destructor. Extra care must be taken during start-up to minimize emissions. Trees and brush should be cut as long a time before burning as possible to maximize drying. 
(5)  Great care must also be taken when charging the pit to never overload. Newly added trees and brush must not pile or protrude so high that they break the air curtain. 
(6)  Periodic ash removal is essential to maintaining efficient combustion and minimizing air emissions. Ashes should not be allowed to build up in the pit to higher than one-third of the pit depth or to the point where they begin to impede combustion, whichever occurs first. 
(e)  Integrity of the pit. If wear and tear, heat, or soil conditions cause significant crumbling or erosion of the pit walls, the fire chief or his designee may require the operator to cease burning until a new acceptable pit can be dug and approved. 
(f)  General safety requirements. The operator must do everything possible to protect the safety of workers and the public. 
(1)  To protect public safety, it is required that an effective, child-proof fence surround the combustion pit when unattended. 
(2)  To protect against potentially serious loader accidents, the pit should be dug in stable soil. Where necessary, earth anchors, backstays, or wire mesh should be used for additional support. 
(3)  A stop guide or restraining board is recommended at the loading side of the pit to prevent the loader from getting too close to the pit during charging operations. 
(g)  Additional requirements. Fire department representatives may determine that additional operating or safety requirements are needed, based on conditions observed during inspections, public complaints, or other factors. Such additional requirements or restrictions shall become enforceable conditions of the burning permit.

Sec. 42-148. - Backfilling, topping and paving; work to be performed by contractor; notice required. 
All backfilling, topping or paving in any street, alley, sidewalk or public ground shall be done by the company making the excavation. The inspection office shall be notified of the location of all cuts prior to their being made and shall be informed when backfilling operations are ready to begin. 
(Code 1978, § 32-118; Code 1994, § 102-290)  
Sec. 42-149. - Materials and procedure. 
The following specifications shall apply to excavations made under this article: 
(1)  AB-3 is to be used for backfill up to the lower surface of the existing surface materials. The AB-3 shall be placed in successive lifts of not more than 12 inches and each lift is to be compacted by mechanical means. The AB-3 is to contain moisture sufficient to result in a finished base equal to or greater than the density of the adjacent material. 
(2)  Surfacing is to be placed 12 inches minimum on each side of a trench, including the beginning and ending of trenches. 
(3)  On all curbed and guttered streets, regardless of existing surface, the street cut shall be filled with 3,000 psi concrete to a minimum depth of six inches or from the base of the original pavement, whichever is the greater. The concrete shall be flat-finished and neatly edged. Seal coat surfacings shall be replaced with a minimum of six inches of asphalt. Hot mix asphalt shall be used when available. If seasonal or availability conditions warrant, cold mix asphalt may be used, provided the cold mix equals the hot mix density. Rock or gravel roads and alleys are to be backfilled with AB-3 compacted to a density equal to or greater than the adjacent undisturbed area, then covered with road rock that equals the original surface in size. 
(4)  Asphalt, asphalt-brick combination and concrete are to be saw cut to neat lines. The saw cut may be made when the cut is filled and is not required to be done at the time the cut is opened. 
(5)  All finished surfaces are to be checked with a straight edge or string line at the time of finishing or tamping of the asphalt. 
(6)  Excavations under sidewalks are to be backfilled with AB-3 and thoroughly tamped to achieve a density to prevent settlement. 
(7)  Excavations extending back of the curbline or beyond the ditch line of gravel or seal coated streets shall be backfilled with the material from the excavation and, further, the initial four feet shall be backfilled in six-inch lifts and tamped to 95 percent of optimum density using the standard proctor test as performed by a commercial testing laboratory. Wet material that will not meet optimum moisture density shall be modified by the addition of four percent of hydrated or quick lime by volume. Existing ground cover is to be replaced by either stockpiled sod or freshly cut sod or seeding and fertilizer as may be approved by the director of public works or his designated representative when the backfill is completed. Sodding or seeding is expected to be completed during the same day or the next working day. Backfill with frozen dirt may be done with the explicit understanding that the trench fill material is to be re-excavated and tamped when the ground thaws. If the inspection office declares that an excavation appears not to be meeting this standard, the contractor may elect the following: 
a.  To have a minimum of two Shelby tube samples taken in the finished excavation to determine the in-place density to be compared to an adjacent undisturbed sample. If the compacted materials fail to equal or exceed the level of adjacent soil density values, in the opinion of the commercial testing laboratory, then the contractor will remove and replace all the trench fill materials. The building inspector or designated representative shall be sole judge of the quality of the fill. 
b.  Replace the fill in its entirety to the heretofore enumerated standards. 
(8)  All service cut trenches are to have a minimum width of 18 inches.

Sec. 1.05. - Nonconformances. 
A.  General. Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming uses. A definition of each type is as follows: 
1.  Nonconforming lot of record. A lot which is part of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was recorded prior to the adoption of the original subdivision regulations in the city, July 19, 1966, and neither the lot nor parcel complies with the lot width or area requirements for any permitted uses in the district in which it is located.

3.  Nonconforming use. An existing use which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  Nonconforming lots of record. The building inspector shall issue a building permit for any nonconforming lot of record provided that: 
1.  The lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations, and 
2.  The lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations, and 
3.  The lot or group of continuous nonconforming lots can meet all setback requirements for the district in which it is located, and 
4.  The lot can connect with a public sewer system or can meet the minimum sanitary sewer requirements of the city. 
C.  Nonconforming structures. 
1.  Authority to continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable property development standards on the effective date of these development regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
2.  Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled, provided however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. 
3.  Setbacks and yards. A structure which is in nonconformance with respect to a side or rear yard setback shall not use the existing setback in expanding or enlarging but may be enlarged if the new part of the structure complies with the setbacks of the district. 
4.  Destruction. If a nonconforming structure is damaged by more than 50 percent of its fair market value, such building shall not be restored if such building is not in conformance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located, or an exception is granted by the board of zoning appeals. 
5.  Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. 
D.  Nonconforming uses. 
1.  Authority to continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure or only involving a structure which is accessory to such use or land, may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful. 
2.  Ordinary repair and maintenance. 
a.  Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use. 
b.  Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety who declares such structure unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition. 
3.  Extension. Any nonconforming use shall not be physically extended, expanded, or enlarged. Such prohibited activities shall include, without being limited to: 
a.  Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations (or on the effective date of subsequent amendments or that cause such use to become nonconforming). 
b.  Extension of such use within a building or other structure to a portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of subsequent amendments hereto that cause such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such use may be extended throughout any part of such building or other structure that is lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use on such effective date. 
4.  Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
5.  Damage or destruction. If a structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by more than 50 percent of its fair market value, such building shall not be restored if the use of such building is not in conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
6.  Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance, to any location on the same or other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof or the use of land shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. 
7.  Change in use. Any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use, as an exception granted by board of zoning appeals in accordance with article 11, board of zoning appeals, provided that the board of zoning appeals, either by general rule or by findings of fact in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards. 
8.  Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is abandoned for a period of 24 consecutive months any subsequent use or occupancy of such land after this period shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located. 
9.  Nonconforming accessory uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate. 
E.  Status of special use permits. 
1.  Status of existing special use permits. Where a special use permit exists at the effective date of these development regulations and is permitted by these regulations as a special use permit in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be deemed a lawful conforming use in such zoning district, as provided by prior approval. Where a special use permit exists at the effective date of these development regulations and is not permitted as a special use permit in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be deemed a continuing nonconforming use. 
2.  Status of existing legal uses designated as special uses. Any existing legal use at the effective date of these development regulations which is designated as a special use by these development regulations shall be deemed as an existing special use and a lawful conforming use. 
F.  Signs for nonconforming uses. The lawful use of any sign existing at the time of the passage of these development regulations, in conjunction with a nonconforming use, may be continued. Any sign installed subsequent to the passage of these development regulations for a nonconforming use must conform to the article 8, signs in compliance with the district in which the nonconforming use is located.

a.  The character of the neighborhood; 
b.  The zoning and use of properties nearby; 
c.  The suitability of the subject property for the uses to which it has been restricted; 
d.  The extent to which removal of the restrictions will detrimentally affect nearby property; 
e.  The length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned; 
f.  The relative gain to economic development, public health, safety and welfare by the reduction of the value of the landowner's property as compared to the hardship imposed by such reduction upon the individual landowner; 
g.  The recommendations of permanent or professional staff; 
h.  The conformance of the requested change to the adopted or recognized comprehensive land use plan being utilized by the city; and 
i.  Other factors as may be relevant to a particular proposed amendment. The factors considered in taking action on any proposed amendment shall be included in the minutes or otherwise be made part of the written record.

Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the city commission by a simple majority thereof may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by ordinance or it need take no further action thereon. If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the city commission following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the city commission's report, the city commission shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly. 
9.  Publication. If the city commission approves an application, it shall adopt an ordinance to that effect, but the ordinance shall not become effective until its publication in the official newspaper. If the official zoning district map has been adopted by reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or boundary as amended, shall order the official zoning district map to be changed to reflect such amendment and shall amend the section of the regulations incorporating the same and shall reincorporate such map as amended.

6.  Protest by petition. If a written protest against a proposed special use permit is filed in the office of the city clerk within 14 days as of the date of the conclusion of the public hearing, pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of record of 20 percent or more of the total area required to be notified by this application for a special use permit, excluding streets and public ways, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a three-fourths vote of all of the members of the city commission. 
7.  Final approval. The city commission may recommend issuance of a special use permit whenever it finds that: 
a.  The proposed special use complies with all applicable provisions of this article. 
b.  The proposed special use at the specified location will contribute to and promote the economic development, welfare or convenience of the public. 
c.  The special use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located. 
d.  The location and size of the special use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the special use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the special use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to: 
(1)  The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls, and fences on the site, and 
(2)  The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.

The continuation of a special use permit exists with the property as long as such special use permit is used in accordance with its original intended and approved purpose and the annual SUP fee is paid. Any discontinuance of more than 12 months, violation of permit conditions, or failure to pay a fee may enable the city commission to administratively rescind a special use permit. 
D.  Revocation. A special use permit may be revoked for cause upon the finding that the special use permit has violated any criteria of approval, changed circumstances supporting the approval or a determination that the use has become a nuisance by reason of design or operation of the use, site or buildings. Revocation shall require that the city commission hold a public hearing with at least 21 days' notice and no more than 60 days' notice, with a certified letter being sent to the property owner and general notice to the public. Notice shall contain the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing and cite the reason for the proposed revocation. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 8063, § 1, 11-28-2017)  
Sec. 2.05. - Site plan. 
A.  Applicability. All applications for multifamily, commercial, industrial, SUPs, PUDs and rezoning shall be accompanied by a site plan and all submissions for a building permit for any permitted use therein must be accompanied by a site development plan. Single-family dwellings are exempt from this requirement. 
B.  Site plan procedures. Applications for a site plan shall be proposed on forms established by the director of the planning department and filed with the planning department. Except for site plans that accompany other required approval processes, applications shall be processed according to the following specific procedures: 
1.  The city planner shall determine if submitted site plans are in accordance with these regulations and then forward all site plan submissions to the development review committee along with a written opinion on the plan's merits. 
2.  The development review committee is responsible for final review and approval of site plans for multifamily residential, mixed-use, mobile home parks, planned unit developments, commercial or industrial developments which are in accordance with these regulations. 
3.  In its review, the development review committee will consult and consider the recommendation of the various departments and agencies affected by the proposed site plan. 
4.  If the development review committee rejects or withholds approval of the site plan the applicant may appeal the decision to the planning commission at its next regular meeting. The planning commission may recommend approval, disapproval or approval with conditions to the city commission. 
C.  Criteria. Site design shall ensure that all provisions of these development regulations and all other ordinances, comprehensive land use plan, and general plans and standards of the city shall be complied with, where applicable. In determining the applicability of a site plan to the standards, and in interpreting the standards, the following criteria shall be used: 
1.  The proposed development shall not have any detrimental effect upon the general health, welfare, safety, and convenience of persons residing or working in the neighborhood; and shall not be detrimental or injurious to the neighborhood. 
2.  The proposed development shall promote a desirable relationship of structures: to one another; to open spaces; and to the topography on the site and in the surrounding area. 
3.  The height, area, setbacks, and overall mass, as well as parts of any structure (buildings, walls, signs, lighting, etc.) and landscaping shall be adequate and appropriate to the development, the neighborhood, and the community. 
4.  Ingress, egress, internal traffic circulation, off-street parking facilities, loading and service areas, and pedestrian walkways shall be so designed as to promote safety and convenience. 
5.  The architectural character of the proposed structure shall meet the requirements of article 7, design standards. 
D.  Amendment to site plan. No approved site plan may be modified, or expanded in ground or structural area more than ten percent of the gross floor area unless the site plan is amended and approved in accordance with the procedures applicable to initial approval, or as otherwise approved through minor modifications in section II.F[2.06]. Such changes will require the applicant to resubmit the site plan as outlined in the preceding sections. 
E.  Effect of decision. All elements of the approved site plan must be executed in association with a building permit or certificate of occupancy, except that installation of landscape may be delayed for up to six months to allow optimal planting, and provided other adequate assurances of implementation are provided by applicant. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 2.06. - Minor modifications. 
A.  General. This section sets forth the required review and approval procedures for "minor modifications," that are minor deviations from otherwise applicable standards that may be approved by the director. Minor modifications are to be used when the small size of the modification requested and the unlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood make it infeasible to seek a formal variance. Minor modifications to development standards may only be requested where no additional permit, such as conditional use or special use, is required prior to construction. 
B.  Applicability. Requests for minor modifications must be made in writing to the director who shall have 21 days from receipt to respond in writing. If the director does not act on the request within 21 calendar days, the application shall be deemed denied. The director may approve a single minor modification per development of up to a maximum of ten percent from the following general development and zoning district standards: 
1.  Minimum lot area requirements; 
2.  Setback requirements; and 
3.  Quantitative development standards generally applicable throughout the development regulations of the city. 
The director shall have sole decision-making authority for a minor modification. 
C.  Limitations. In no circumstance shall the director approve a minor modification that results in: 
1.  Any change in required floodplain elevations; 
2.  An increase in overall project density; 
3.  A change in permitted uses or mix of uses; 
4.  A deviation from the use-specific standards in article 4, zoning districts and standards; 
5.  A change in conditions attached to the approval of any site plan or special use permit; 
6.  A change to a development feature already modified through a variance or other minor modification; or 
7.  Any change in the maximum area of signage. 
8.  No more than two standards may be modified on any single development project. 
D.  Criteria. The review and approval of a minor modification is administrative and shall not require any form of notice or a public hearing prior to determination. The following criteria shall be met for a minor modification: 
1.  Evidence of substantial compliance with the provisions of the comprehensive land use plan, any other applicable city plans and the development regulations; 
2.  Compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
E.  Appeal. Appeal of the director's determination shall be to the development review committee. 
F.  Approval termination. An approved minor modification terminates at the same time as the original approval. Minor modification of an approval does not extend the lapse period of the original approval. 
G.  Record of minor modifications and annual review. The director shall keep a record of all minor modifications that includes information about the date of the request, the location of the project, a brief description of the minor modification request, and the director's action. The director shall submit the minor modification log to the planning commission annually for review. Upon reviewing the record, the planning commission may determine whether changes to the zoning and development ordinance of the city are necessary.

ARTICLE 3. - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 3.01. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this article is to provide for the proper location and width of streets, building lines, open spaces, safety and recreation facilities, utilities, and drainage, and for the avoidance of congestion of population through requirements of minimum lot width, depth and area and the compatibility of design; to require and fix the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be graded and improved, and water, sewer, drainage, and other utility mains and piping or connections or other physical improvements shall be installed; and to provide for and secure the actual construction of such physical improvements. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 3.02. - Applicability and exemptions. 
A.  General applicability. The standards in this article apply to anyone platting property, or to any application that involves or requires the construction or alteration of public improvements as a result of development. 
B.  Exemptions. The standards in this article shall not apply in the following instances: 
1.  The division of land into parcels or tracts of not more than five acres and not involving any new streets or easements of access and not affecting major streets. 
2.  A change in the boundary between adjoining lands which does not create an additional lot or a nonconforming lot or further the nonconformance of any lot or any structure on that lot. 
3.  Land used for street or railroad right-of-way, drainage easement or other public utilities subject to local, state or federal regulations, where no new street or easement of access is involved. 
4.  The re-subdivision of land to be used for industrial purposes only. 
5.  Any transfer by operation of law. 
C.  Restrictive covenants. The planning commission shall have the right to confer with the applicant regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision and may require that certain minimum regulations regarding this matter be incorporated in the restrictive covenants. Such regulations shall be intended to protect the character and value of the surrounding development of the property which is being subdivided. 
D.  Planned unit development. In accordance with planned unit development district regulations of the development regulations, the preliminary development plan may be used as the preliminary plat. Approval of the preliminary development plan by the city commission signifies concurrent approval of the preliminary plat, subject to any requirements made as a condition of this approval. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 8097 , § 1, 3-12-2019)  
Sec. 3.03. - Minimum design standards. 
The design of the subdivision shall provide for efficient traffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between surrounding, existing development, and the proposed layout. The comprehensive land use plan should be used as a guide in determining if the design of the proposed subdivision is proper. The planning commission shall have the authority to deny a plat or request redesign, if, in its opinion, the layout is not the most suitable for the site. 
A.  Blocks. 
1.  Length. Intersecting streets (which determine block length) shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets in the neighborhood. In residential districts, where no existing plats are recorded, the blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length, except that a greater length may be permitted where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block. Such pedestrian ways or easements shall have a minimum width of ten feet. 
2.  Width. In residential development, the block width shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. In certain instances, however, a different arrangement may be required in order to provide better circulation or to protect a major circulation route. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width and depth as may be considered most suitable for the prospective use. 
B.  Streets and alleys. The planning commission shall review all plats for impacts on the urban design, transportation, and utility functions of all rights-of-way, including any part of the system impacted by the subdivision. According to the policies and designs in the major street plan, or other plans and policies affecting rights-of-way, public realm design, and public facilities, the planning commission shall have the right to restrict and regulate the design and points of access to all property from the public streets system. Such restriction shall be indicated on the final plat. 
1.  Relationship to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall provide for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall be not less than the minimum street widths established herein. Alleys, when required, and street arrangement must cause no hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted and dedicated as a public way. 
2.  Street name. Streets that are obviously in alignment with other already existing and named streets shall bear the name of the existing streets. Street names should not be similar to already platted street names. All street names shall be assigned by the property owner subject to the final approval by the planning commission in their review of the plat. House numbers shall be assigned by the director of public works. 
3.  Local streets. Local streets shall be so designed to discourage through or non-local traffic. Local streets should not intersect arterial streets. If two local streets do not line up, they shall be offset at least 125 feet. 
4.  Cul-de-sacs. An adequate turnaround of not less than a 100-foot diameter right-of-way shall be provided at the closed end of a dead-end local street longer than one lot in length. Such local street segment shall not exceed 800 feet in length from the intersection of a cross street to the juncture with the cul-de-sac. 
5.  Right angle intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be 60 degrees. 
6.  Streets adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, limited access freeway, principal highway, or arterial street. Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad rights-of-way, limited access freeways, principal highways, or arterial streets, a marginal access street or frontage road may be required adjacent to the boundary of such rights-of-way. The distance from rights-of-way shall be determined, with consideration to minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade-separated intersections. 
7.  Half-streets. Half-streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets where applicable, or where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or, when the planning commission finds that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street or portion thereof is existing and adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be based on minimum requirements as set forth in this article and the engineering and public works department's infrastructure design and construction manual and shall be platted within such tract. 
8.  Alleys. Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, wherever possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end. In residential areas, alleys of adjoining subdivisions will not be closed or shut-off by failing to provide alleys in the proposed subdivision. 
9.  Minimum requirements. The right-of-way grades and widths for streets and alleys, shall not be less than the minimum for each classification as follows: 
TABLE 3-01. REQUIRED ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND DESIRABLE GRADES 
	Minimum Right-of-Way Width 	Desirable Grade 
Local streets: 
 Residential 	60 feet 	10% 
 Industrial and commercial 	80 feet 	6% 
Cul-de-sacs 	100 feet diameter 	
Marginal access streets or frontage roads: 
 Two-way 	50 feet 	10% 
 One-way 	50 feet 	10% 
 Alleys 	20 feet 	10% 
 Pedestrian ways 	10 feet 	NA 
 
When existing or anticipated traffic or arterial and collector streets warrant greater widths of rights-of-way, the additional width shall be dedicated. The minimum gradient on a street shall be 1.0 percent. 
10.  Street alignment. Minimum horizontal and vertical alignment on all streets, except in unusual cases, shall be as follows: 
a.  Minimum horizontal-radii at the centerline. 
(1)  Local streets, 230 feet. 
b.  Minimum sight distance on vertical curves. 
(1)  Local streets, 200 feet. 
11.  Street geometry. On streets with reverse curves, a reasonable tangent shall be provided between curves to permit a smooth flow of traffic. 
12.  Street layout. Proposed streets shall conform to topography as nearly as possible to reduce drainage problems and grades. 
13.  Intersecting streets. Off-center intersecting streets shall be at least 125 feet apart, measured center to center. 
14.  Street elevation. All streets shall be constructed at least at the 100-year flood elevation, or higher. 
C.  Lots design. 
1.  Minimum lot width shall be measured at the building setback line. 
2.  Minimum lot depth shall be 100 feet (said measurement shall be made through the center of the lot).

(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 3.05. - Exceptions. 
Whenever the planning commission deems full conformance to provisions of these regulations is impractical or impossible due to the size, shape, topography, location or condition, or such usage of land included in a subdivision plat being presented for approval or because of the layout of surrounding properties, the planning commission may recommend authorization of excepting these regulations in the final plat. The exceptions are separate and distinct from those exceptions relative to zoning which are granted by the board of zoning appeals and other ordinances and codes effective in the city. Such recommendation shall intend that substantial justice may be done and the public interest be secured. The planning commission recommendation for authorization of exceptions shall be made by letter of transmittal to the city commission. In recommending such exceptions, the planning commission shall find the following: 
A.  That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that strict application of these regulations would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his land and is not merely the grant of a privilege; 
B.  That the variances or exceptions are necessary for the reasonable and acceptable development of the property in question; and 
C.  That the granting of any exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity in which the property is situated.

A.  Preservation of trees and existing vegetation. Landscaping plans should be designed to preserve and protect existing native vegetation and mature trees. Bonus landscape credit shall be awarded for preserved vegetation as indicated in table VIII-1[6-04] above, where the director accepts the existing vegetation and/or trees as being in good health and meeting the intent of the landscaping requirements of this section. 
B.  Allowed plant materials. Proposed materials must be specified on development plans. The use of low water, drought-tolerant plants is strongly encouraged for all new landscaping. A list of permissible plant species that are either native vegetation or compatible with the climate zones found in the city shall be adopted by the planning commission and may be amended from time-to-time. Materials not on the list may be approved if the director determines that they are equally or more suitable for local soil conditions, climate, and would provide the same or better level of visual benefits and have desired growth habits. No noxious weeds, as defined by the state, are permitted for use in the city. 
C.  Irrigation and watering requirements. 
1.  The landscaping site plan must identify the area of approximate installation of an automatic irrigation system, its maintenance, and intended uses. All landscape plans must note and delineate all irrigated and sod areas. No in-ground irrigation components shall be permitted in the right-of-way. 
2.  Required landscape areas shall be irrigated by an automatic underground irrigation system, surface drip system, subterranean drip system, or a combination of these systems. 
3.  A hose bib system may be used for irrigation when a landscape area is less than 1,000 square feet in size and when all portions of the area are within 50 feet of a hose attachment. 
4.  Irrigation systems shall be equipped with timers and scheduled to operate during evening or early morning hours to minimize evaporation rates. 
5.  Sprinkler systems shall be configured to prevent over-spray of water onto streets and sidewalks. 
D.  Landscape maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance of the landscaping shall lie with the property owner, his/her successor, and/or their agents for all nonresidential property. Failure to maintain required landscaping shall be consider a site design violation of this Code. All landscaping elements shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, whenever necessary, replaced with new plant materials to ensure continued compliance with these standards. All required landscaped areas shall be kept free of weeds, debris, and litter. In addition, all walls and fences shall also be maintained in good condition and, when necessary, be repaired or replaced. Any required landscape material, including any tree, grass or shrub, that dies shall be replaced by June 1 of each year. All required landscaping shall be cleared of all unplanned vegetation including weeds at least once each year prior to June 1.

A.  Single-family residential screening. On residential lots, utility equipment shall be located behind the building line of the house and screened from public view by a wall, fence, or landscaping screen according to these development regulations. 
B.  Multifamily, mixed-use, commercial, and industrial screening. For all developments other than single-family residential, the following mechanical equipment screening standard shall apply to the maximum extent feasible: 
1.  Roof-mounted mechanical equipment. Roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened by a parapet wall or similar feature that is an integral part of the building's architectural design. The parapet wall or similar feature shall be of a height equal to or greater than the height of the mechanical equipment being screened. Roof-mounted mechanical equipment, except solar energy systems, is prohibited on single-family residential dwellings. 
2.  Wall-mounted mechanical equipment. Wall-mounted mechanical equipment, except air conditioning equipment (e.g., window AC units), that protrudes more than six inches from the outer building wall shall be screened from view by structural features that are compatible with the architecture and color of the subject building. Wall-mounted mechanical equipment that protrudes six inches or less from the outer building wall shall be designed to blend with the color and architectural design of the subject building. 
3.  Ground-mounted mechanical equipment. Ground-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from view by landscaping or by a decorative wall that is compatible with the architecture and landscaping of the development site. The wall shall be of a height equal to or greater than the height of the mechanical equipment being screened. 
C.  Utilities. 
1.  All new utility lines, with the exception of major transmission lines, shall be placed underground. 
2.  Utility poles (other than wooden poles erected by a public utility company) and supports shall be painted or be of materials neutral in color. 
3.  All transformers and other facilities and equipment, including communications equipment, shall either be screened through the use of architectural materials compatible with the architectural materials present on the site or, screening shall be adequate to screen such facilities from all rights-of-way. 
D.  Alternate screening. Mechanical equipment that is not screened in full compliance with the screening standards of these development regulations shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures of the section dealing with, alternative equivalent compliance. Alternate screening methods may include, but shall not be limited to, increased setbacks, increased landscaping, grouping the equipment on specific portions of a site, and painting or otherwise camouflaging the equipment. 
E.  Screening of service, loading, and storage areas. 
1.  Applicability. These screening requirements are applicable to all service, loading, and storage areas. Owners are encouraged to locate the types of features listed in this subsection where they are not visible from off-site or from public areas of a site, so that screening is unnecessary.

Any property owner who fails to maintain any fence or screening structure in a clean, sanitary and inoffensive condition and free and clear of all obnoxious substances, rubbish and weeds shall, after 30 days' written notice from the director or his agent, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalty provisions of these development regulations and any other applicable city ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 8063, § 1, 11-28-2017)  
Sec. 6.09. - Tree preservation. 
The purpose of this subsection is to protect the existing tree canopy as well as protect future tree canopies of the city when development or redevelopment occurs. The standards in this subsection are intended to regulate the removal of trees on lots within the city. It is not the intent of this subsection to unduly restrict desirable development and redevelopment that would otherwise be possible without these standards. The standards in this subsection shall be applied during review of any development or building permit application. 
A.  Preservation of significant trees. Significant trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent feasible. For the purposes of this standard, the caliper of a "significant" tree shall be at least 24 inches for a deciduous tree and 18 inches for an evergreen. 
B.  Significant tree replacement. Where significant trees cannot feasibly be preserved, the total caliper inches of the tree(s) that are removed shall be replaced on-site by the same caliper inches of new trees. For example, if a 24-inch caliper sugar maple is removed from the site; new trees with total caliper inches of 24 must be replanted. The new trees shall either be of the same or similar species, or, if identified by the director or his/her designee for species diversification, shall be from a list of permissible species provided by the director or designee. 
C.  Combination planting and payment replacement. If site limitations affect the ability of the developer to replace the total caliper inches of the removed tree(s), the director or his/her designee may allow the developer to reduce the replacement measurement. The planted caliper inches shall allow for the maximum replacement of caliper inches feasible on the site. This reduction may not exceed 50 percent of the total caliper inches removed. 
D.  Enforcement. The director or his/her designee shall send a letter to all development applicants reminding them of the significant tree replacement requirements. 
E.  Removal of a dead or dying tree or unsafe tree. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a property owner to keep a dead or dying tree. The status of a tree shall be determined by the director or his/her designee prior to removal. The city may require a property owner to remove a dead or dying tree if it is determined to be a hazard to public safety. 
F.  Tree protection during construction. 
1.  Owner's responsibility. During development, the owner or developer is responsible for the erection of all barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed trees from damage both during and after construction in accordance with the standards of this subsection. 
2.  Tree protection fencing. All significant trees and trees intended for use as credit towards the landscaping and tree-protection standards of article shall be fenced in accordance with this subsection before grading or other land-disturbing activity begins. 
a.  Fencing shall extend at least one foot in distance from the edge of the tree for each inch of diameter at breast height (DBH) to a maximum of ten feet, but in no case closer than five feet to the trunk. The director shall consider existing site conditions in determining the exact location of any tree protection fencing. 
b.  The developer shall erect a plastic mesh fence or chain-link fence a minimum of four feet in height at the drip line around each tree or group of trees to prevent the placement of debris or fill within the drip line of any tree. 
c.  All tree protection measures shall be inspected and approved by the director prior to start of any land disturbing activities. Failure to have tree protection measures prior to the commencement of construction is a violation of these regulations. 
d.  The tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the site plan or grading permit. No construction, grading, equipment, material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within the fenced area except in accordance with the standards in subsection [F]3. [of this section], encroachments into root zones. Fencing shall be maintained until the land disturbance activities are complete. 
3.  Encroachments into root zones. Encroachments within the root zones of trees protected in accordance with this subsection shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be employed prior to the encroachment: 
a.  Written verification is prepared by a qualified arborist of the tree's condition before and after the encroachment, including preventive measures that shall be employed prior to, during, and after the encroachment to ensure the viability of the tree. 
b.  Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the protection area, the area shall first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within the tree protection zone. 
c.  In no instance shall any effluent associated with construction process, including concrete mixing, pouring, or rinsing processes, drain onto lands protected by tree protection fencing or other control measures.

(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 7.02. - Residential design. 
A.  Design objective. The design objective of the residential design standards are to: 
1.  Promote "four-sided" architecture, where buildings are designed as a complete and integrated product, considering visibility and impact on all adjacencies. 
2.  Encourage variation in building design so that a compatible range and scale of buildings encourage diversity in details that prevent monotonous streetscapes. 
3.  Create relationships between residential streetscapes and buildings and sites that reinforce the overall character of the block and neighborhood. 
B.  Specific applicability. The following standards apply to all residential buildings of any type, unless specifically noted and limited to a certain building type or context. 
C.  Mass and form. The following standards require a compatible mass and form of residential buildings, particularly when different building types are mixed or transition on or across adjacent blocks. Mass and form standards are broken out by specific building types and contexts. 
1.  Single-family infill. Single-family infill located on a block face where more than 50 percent of the existing homes are single-family shall employ the following technique to help maintain a lower-intensity residential character along the street frontage: 
a.  Design of the infill structure shall mimic the building proportions, setbacks, drive style, and location, orientation, height, bulk, and mass of the predominant architectural styles(s) found on both sides of the street. 
b.  Professionally prepared elevations are not required, unless the director is unable to determine the nature of the design from the documents submitted. 
c.  Designs submitted in accordance with this section shall be reviewed by the director. Appeal from the decision of the director shall be to the city commission. 
2.  Townhomes. No more than six single-family dwelling units shall be attached in a single row. Facades shall be differentiated into separate units by the following: 
a.  Each unit shall have distinctly different facades and no attached single-family structure facade shall be repeated more than once every four structures on the same side of the street. 
b.  The facades of single-family attached town homes shall be punctuated by a change in texture material, offset, or other architectural feature to differentiate individual units. 
3.  Multidwelling structures. Buildings with three or more dwellings or any residential buildings constructed as part of a multifamily development shall meet the following mass and form standards: 
a.  The minimum separation between multifamily buildings, including accessory buildings, on the same lot or development parcel is 15 feet. 
b.  Multifamily buildings in a single development shall be clustered or grouped to form neighborhoods. 
c.  Developments with at least four units shall provide 150 square feet of private common open space for each multifamily dwelling unit. A minimum of 40 percent of the open space shall be usable for recreation, including swimming pools, sport courts, or playgrounds with equipment. Required landscaping is excluded from open space calculations. 
d.  Each elevation shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least four feet and extending a minimum of four feet at a minimum interval of 30 feet. 
e.  The elevations of all multifamily buildings shall be articulated through the incorporation of at least three or more of the following: 
(1)  Balconies; 
(2)  Bay or box windows; 
(3)  Porches or covered entries; 
(4)  Dormers; 
(5)  Accent materials such as brick, stone, or stucco with banding highlights; 
(6)  Window grills and shutters; 
(7)  Variation in window sizes and shapes; or 
(8)  Vertical elements that demarcate building modules. 
f.  The height of each multifamily building taller than 35 feet shall be stepped down from its highest roofline at least one full story on any end of the building located within 50 feet of a street right-of-way or an adjacent area zoned or used for single-family residential. 
g.  Multifamily buildings shall provide concentrated unit access points. Monotonous access balconies and corridors running the length of the exterior of a building are prohibited. 
h.  Multifamily infill located on a block face where more than 75 percent of existing homes are single-family shall employ one or more of the following techniques to help reduce the overall bulk and mass of individual buildings and help maintain a lower-intensity residential character along the street frontage: 
(1)  Articulating the front facade so that the building appears from the street to be separate homes by "stepping back" the front facade a minimum of ten feet at the traditional side yard setback [that] would typically be found between two single-family homes; 
(2)  Organizing units around a central courtyard that maintains the impression of the traditional side yard setback between units along the street frontage; or 
(3)  Designing the multifamily building so that the massing, arrangement of architectural elements, and use of exterior materials gives the appearance of a large single-family home. 
i.  Rooflines longer than 50 feet shall include at least one vertical elevation change of at least two feet. 
j.  The incorporation of a variety of roof forms is strongly encouraged. Upper-level residential floors may be incorporated into the roof form to reduce the apparent height and mass of buildings. 
D.  Orientation and articulation. The following orientation and articulation standards require that buildings relate to neighborhood streetscapes and share pedestrian-oriented details that help reduce the scale of buildings and create a range of compatible but distinct designs and patterns, even when different building mass or forms exist, and particularly when different architectural styles are blended. 
1.  Entrances. To the maximum extent feasible, the primary entrance and facade of individual buildings shall not be oriented towards parking, but shall be oriented towards: 
a.  An abutting public street, or 
b.  Common open space, such as interior courtyards, parks, or on-site natural areas or features with a clearly defined and easily accessible pedestrian circulation system. 
c.  All ground-floor units with frontage along the primary street shall have an entrance that faces the street. Multifamily buildings located with multiple street frontages shall provide entrances to units along each street frontage. 
d.  Exterior entrances from a public sidewalk or common open space are permitted for dwelling units on the ground floor. These entrances shall be raised from the finished ground-floor level of the sidewalk a minimum of two feet, 18 inches. 
e.  Dwelling units above the ground floor shall have interior unit entrances, except that exterior stairs are permitted for access to upper-floor units only if they are oriented towards a central plaza not visible from any street. 
2.  Transparency. At least 25 percent of all wall surface area facing a public street shall be windows. 
3.  Vertical articulation. Buildings three stories or more shall use the following design details to reduce the scale of the facade: 
a.  The top floor of any building shall contain a distinctive finish, consisting of a cornice, banding, or other architectural termination. 
b.  An expression line shall delineate divisions between floors of all buildings, and a cornice shall delineate the tops of facades for buildings that do not utilize a pitched roof. 
C  Buildings shall be designed to incorporate visually heavier and more massive elements at the building base, and lighter elements above the base. Upper stories shall not appear heavier or demonstrate greater mass than the lower stories of the building. 
E.  Materials. The following materials are acceptable for construction: 
1.  Brick, concrete stucco, stone, stone facing, textured masonry block, wood, glass in combination with metal, or similar, durable architectural materials. 
2.  This list may be amended by the addition of other acceptable materials without amending these regulations. 
3.  All added acceptable materials shall be approved by the DRC. The chief building official shall maintain the list of additional acceptable materials. 
4.  EIFS, or synthetic stucco may be approved on a case-by-case basis. 
F.  Garages, parking and access. The following garage, parking and access standards balance the design of sites and buildings for cars, with impacts on neighborhood streetscapes and pedestrian scale residential design. 
1.  Front-loaded garage doors shall not comprise more than 45 percent of the building line on the front facade. 
2.  Alternative garage locations such as side- or rear-entry, detached garages, or garages setback at least 12-feet from the front building line are encouraged. 
a.  Any detached garage shall be architecturally compatible, and consistent in materials, design and colors as the main building. 
b.  Any side loaded garage shall have designs on the street-facing wall that are compatible with the house design materials identical to the primary facade, and by incorporating at least two of the following elements: 
(1)  Two or more windows, with a size, orientation and design similar to those on the primary facade; 
(2)  A permanent trellis covering a minimum of 25 percent of the wall area. One vine for every eight linear feet of trellis shall be planted at its base. Appropriate vine species are approved by the director; or 
(3)  Garage or living area facade offset from the other a minimum of four feet. 
3.  Driveway widths within the front yard shall be limited to no more than 30 percent of the lot frontage width measured at the front building line or 30 feet, whichever is less. Where this limits access to a lot, alternatives such as single-drives to expanded driveway pads, shared driveways and lanes, or alley-loaded access should be considered. 
4.  To the maximum extent feasible, garage entries, carports, parking areas and parking structures shall be internalized in building groupings or internalized into a residential block and oriented away from the streetscape. 
5.  Overall, parking areas and freestanding parking structures (detached garages or car ports) shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the perimeter public street frontage for multifamily development. 
G.  Variation of design. In order to avoid the monotony of repetitive building design, to encourage diversity and visual interest, and to promote a wide range of distinct details within a narrow range of compatible building types, scale and forms, the following techniques should be used in residential projects affecting multiple adjacent buildings: 
1.  Variation of building types, models or floor plans that result in distinct but compatible building forms when viewed from the streetscape. 
2.  Variation of front entry features, and to design of roof structures associated with front entry features; 
3.  Distinct architectural styles that impact the materials, placement of windows, or level of details and ornamentation while still presenting a compatible design and relationship to the neighborhood streetscape. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 7.03. - Nonresidential design. 
A.  Design objective. The nonresidential design standards are intended to protect and preserve the quality and character of the built environment in the city's mixed use, commercial, and industrial districts. More specifically, the purposes of this section are to: 
1.  Reflect on the impact of various design and development decisions, and how the various styles within our community can be applied to include a greater degree of interest and diversity, but also a greater degree of compatibility and effective transitions. 
2.  Promote a specific and intentional relationship of buildings and sites to streetscapes and public or civic spaces through design. 
3.  Require compatibility in scale, massing and form through recognition of basic building patterns and with subtle transitions through well designed spaces between buildings. 
4.  Ensure quality design through unique styles, details and patterns that support different types of development and contexts in the city. 
B.  Mass and form. 
1.  Vertical articulation. Buildings greater than two stories or taller than 30 feet shall be designed to reduce apparent mass by including a clearly identifiable base, body, and top, with horizontal elements separating these components. The component described as the body must constitute a minimum of 50 percent of the total building height. 
2.  Horizontal articulation. Buildings shall be designed to reduce apparent mass by dividing facades into a series of smaller components. No individual component shall have a length of more than 60 feet. Components shall be distinguished from one another through two or more of the following: 
a.  Variations in roof form and parapet heights; 
b.  Pronounced recesses and projections; 
c.  Wall plane off-sets; 
d.  Distinct changes in texture and color of wall surfaces; 
e.  Ground level arcades and second floor galleries/balconies; 
f.  Protected and recessed entries; and 
g.  Vertical accents or focal points. 
3.  Stepping back of building mass. To the maximum extent feasible, buildings greater than three stories or taller than 45 feet shall provide step backs in the building form to achieve at least one of the following objectives where such an objective is relevant: 
a.  Frame or otherwise maintain important views or view corridors; 
b.  Relate to the surrounding development context; 
c.  Provide human scale adjacent to streets, pedestrian walkways, plazas, or other public spaces; or 
d.  Provide a transition in scale from pedestrian scale to large scale. 
e.  Step backs shall: 
(1)  Be at least eight feet in depth. 
(2)  Generally occur between 12 feet and 45 feet above the finished grade (based upon the height of the structure and the surrounding development context). 
(3)  Where large variations in topography exist (e.g., a building is backed up to an adjacent hillside) or where other unique site constraints exist, alternatives to the building massing and height configurations required above may be approved. 
(4)  Taller structures may require multiple step backs, or variations in building massing and height in order to meet the objectives stated in standard (1) [of subsection B3e(1) of this section], above. 
4.  Multistory buildings. Upper stories shall consist of usable space. 
a.  "False," unoccupied upper floors designed to give the appearance of multiple floors are prohibited. 
b.  If a limited number of buildings within a particular development have multiple stories, the multistory buildings or the portions of buildings that are multiple stories shall be concentrated at corners, along entry corridor roadway frontages, and near transit stops. 
5.  Outparcels. To the maximum extent feasible, outparcels and their buildings shall be clustered in order to define street edges, entry points, and intimate spaces for gathering or seating between buildings. 
a.  The even dispersal of outparcel sites in a widely spaced pattern along streets is strongly discouraged. Buildings shall be organized to promote a compact pattern of development, pedestrian-friendly spaces, streetscapes, areas of naturalized landscaping, and screen parking areas. 
b.  Spaces between buildings on outparcels shall be improved to provide small-scale pedestrian amenities such as plazas, seating areas, pedestrian connections, gathering spaces, or well-landscaped parking areas. 
c.  Buildings located at entrances to a development demarcate a gateway to create an overall identity, set the tone for the development, and mark arrival or entry. 
d.  At major entry points of a development with three or more buildings, buildings shall be organized along the street and at the intersection to create a gateway. 
e.  Architectural attachments shall be incorporated into the facades of buildings, and be placed at major entry points, to help emphasize arrival or entry into the development. These features may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Civic amenities such as patios or plazas with seating and landscape, mini parks or squares. 
(2)  Landscape features such as planters, water features and monument signs. 
(3)  Architecture enhancements such as pilasters, arcades, and tower elements. 
6.  Roofs. 
a.  Roofline articulation. Variations in rooflines shall be used to add interest and reduce the scale of large buildings. Roof features shall complement the character of the overall development. 
b.  Flat roofs. Flat roofs shall include parapets that adhere to articulation requirements for the main face of the structure. The average height of the parapet shall not exceed 15 percent of the height of the supporting wall, unless rooftop equipment cannot be sufficiently screened. A three-dimensional cornice treatment is encouraged for parapets. Parapets shall look complete from all sides if visible at any distance from the ground. Parapets shall be constructed of the same material as the primary facade. 
c.  Overhanging eaves. Overhanging eaves shall extend no less than three feet past the supporting walls. 
d.  Roof pitch. Pitched roofs shall have a pitch consistent with the majority of buildings within 1,000 feet. This requirement excludes roofs for entries and dormers. 
e.  Architectural elements. Architectural elements that add visual interest to the roof, such as dormers and masonry chimneys, are encouraged.

Sec. 7.04. - Alternate equivalent compliance. 
To encourage creative and unique design, "alternative equivalent compliance" (AEC) allows development to occur in a manner that meets the purpose and design objectives of the design standards, yet through an alternative design that does not strictly adhere to the standards. This is not a general waiver of regulations. Rather, this section authorizes a site-specific plan that is equal to or better than the strict application of the standard. 
A.  Applicability. The alternative equivalent compliance procedure is available only for the design standards, or for any property in the ROD district the off-street parking, landscaping and site design, and design standards. 
B.  Pre-application conference required. An applicant proposing alternative equivalent compliance shall request and attend a pre-application conference with the director prior to submitting application materials for the applicable permit(s). This meeting is to discuss the project, the applicable standards, and the proposed method of alternative compliance. The application should include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the requested alternative compliance. 
C.  Decision-making responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be the responsibility of the city commission. For example, if an applicant is requesting a rezoning along with an alternative equivalent compliance application for landscaping, the AEC application will be reviewed with the rezoning application by the planning commission and city commission. Administratively approved projects proposing alternative compliance shall receive written approval of the alternative compliance from the director. 
D.  Criteria. Alternative equivalent compliance may be approved if the applicant demonstrates that the following criteria have been met by the proposed alternative: 
1.  Achieves the purposes and design objectives of this article and the specific intent of the subject standard to the same or better degree than the subject standard; 
2.  Advances the goals and policies of the any official plans or policies of the city, and the intent of the base zoning district; 
3.  Results in benefits to the community that are equivalent to or exceed benefits associated with the subject standard; 
4.  Imposes no greater impacts on adjacent properties than would occur through compliance with the specific requirements of these development regulations. 
E.  Effect of approval. Alternative equivalent compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested and shall not establish a precedent for approval of other requests.

(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016)  
Sec. 9.16. - Procedure for demolition, alteration or expansion. 
Upon receipt of an application for any demolition, alteration or expansion of a landmark, a property within an historic district, the commission and department shall initiate a process to determine if such permitted action is appropriate. All applications shall be reviewed, issued, or denied in accordance with the process outlined herein. 
A.  Determination of appropriateness. Department staff shall prepare a certificate of appropriateness before any alteration or demolition permit may be issued for any landmark or historic district property. Certificates shall be classified as either a minor certificate of appropriateness or a major certificate of appropriateness. All certificates shall include the director's landmark impact determination. 
B.  Minor certificates of appropriateness. Minor certificates shall be issued for any demolition or alteration work involving the following types of permits which can be demonstrated by the owner to have no adverse effect on a landmark or historic district: demolition of non-contributing structures, most interior improvements except those noted as pertinent to a landmark designation, changes to signs, fences, public walkways, public streets, public alleys, public retaining walls and public utilities that do not contribute to the historic character of a landmark or historic district property. 
C.  Monthly reports. Such certificates shall be authorized by the director and reported monthly to the commission. Such certificates may use a standardized checklist of pre-stated reasons and will be issued within 24 hours of receipt except on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays observed by the city. 
D.  Major certificate of appropriateness. Major certificates shall be subject to review and approval by the commission and may be authorized for the following types of permits: interior space rehabilitation when such space was an important component in approval of the landmark nomination; any exterior alteration or expansion of a landmark or historic district property; any proposed new construction on a landmark property or within an historic district; and demolition of part or all of a landmark or building or structure in an historic district. 
E.  Criteria to determine appropriateness. The commission shall adopt principles and guidelines establishing criteria for new construction, alterations, additions, moving, and demolition of landmarks or properties in an historic district, including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Non-binding conceptual reviews are encouraged and the city preservation commission shall wherever possible provide written and graphical examples of similar suitable projects. 
2.  Specific design criteria for exterior alterations of landmarks or historic district properties shall be based on the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as published in section 36, Code of Federal Regulations, part 67 as revised from time to time, and by further reference to such specific design criteria as the commission may require; 
3.  New construction and additions to existing structures shall be sensitive to and take into account the special historic district or landmark characteristics including height, scale, orientation, site coverage, spatial separations, facade and window patterns, entrance and porch size and general design, materials, texture, architectural detail, roof forms, vertical or horizontal elements, walls, fences, landscaping and other features; 
F.  Demolition delay. Demolition applications for landmarks or historic district properties shall be denied for a period not to exceed 180 days if a proposed public or private re-use of the property is unknown. The maximum period of delay may be reduced whenever the commission determines the owner will suffer extreme hardship or will be deprived of all beneficial use of the property by virtue of the delay. In either instance, the commission shall use the delay to negotiate with the owner and interested parties to find a means to preserve the landmark or historic district property. If the proposed re-use of the property is known, the use will be examined for relationship and compatibility with the landmark or historic district before demolition of a contributing or landmark structure may proceed. This section also applies to properties nominated or landmark or historic district designation. Once redevelopment plans are known, the commission will determine appropriateness. 
(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 8063, § 1, 11-28-2017)  
Sec. 9.17. - Signs. 
The commission shall review and approve or deny all requests for signs to be located on a landmark or within an historic district in accordance with the following criteria: 
A.  Signs shall be designed and placed to be an integral part of the property design, in proportion to the landmark and compatible with the environment in historic districts. 
B.  Signs should be relative to the services and shall not block, obscure or distract from the landmark's or historic district's significant design elements. 
C.  Wherever possible, actual historic signage should be maintained and restored to original significance regarding design, materials, craftsmanship, or placement. 
D.  In commercial and industrial zoning districts, illuminated signs shall be designed to reduce glare and shall not detract from the landmark's or district's historic character. 
E.  Freestanding signs and monument placards explaining the landmark's or district's significance or age shall be compatible with the landmark or district, but are otherwise encouraged. Signs shall be regulated for a distance of not more than 300 feet from a landmark or historic district. 
F.  Signs to be placed upon a national register landmark property shall not be subject to the public hearing process and may be approved as a minor certificate of appropriateness if the terms of section 11.19[9.23] are met. Landmark signs which do not meet all of the stated terms shall be set for review by the city preservation commission at its next regular meeting with appeal to the city commission if denied. 
G.  Signs within commercial or industrial historic districts shall not be subject to the public hearing process and may be processed as a minor certificate of appropriateness if the terms of section 11.19[9.23] are met.

H.  Signs within residential historic districts shall be subject to the following procedure: 
1.  Any sign larger than two square feet proposed to be located within a residential historic district or within 300 feet of such district shall require a review by the city preservation commission prior to issuance of any sign permit. 
2.  The commission shall review the sign for compliance with the terms of this subsection and shall modify, approve or deny the permit following a scheduled informal hearing set for its next regular meeting. Such informal hearing shall be preceded by written notice to each of the properties within the affected historic district. 
3.  This is not a formal public hearing process as described elsewhere in this Code for appeals. No notice is required to be advertised. Letters shall be sent by regular mail. Failure to receive notice of such informal hearing shall in no way void the hearing process. The letter mail distribution shall be based upon the addresses of the properties within the district as filed with the nomination for the district in records kept and maintained by the city planning and zoning department. Such notice shall be mailed at least five workdays prior to the date set for the informal hearing. It shall state the date, time and place of the informal hearing and that the city preservation commission will meet to discuss a sign permit request and shall give the address where the sign may be located. 
4.  Should a legal, non-historic commercial or industrial zoned property be located within 300 feet of a residential historic district, then the city sign code shall be used to issue sign permits and no further historic review shall be required. 
5.  During the informal hearing the chair may elect to hear public testimony in favor of or opposed to the sign as designed. The commission may encourage modification of the sign to ensure historic integrity and compatibility with the character of the historic landmark or district, or the commission may grant or deny the sign permit as presented. The owner of the sign may appeal the decision of the commission to the city commission, if denied. 
6.  Appeals shall be in writing received by city staff within seven days of the date of denial.

(Ord. No. 7996, § 1, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 8063, § 1, 11-28-2017; Ord. No. 8097 , § 1, 3-12-2019)  
ATTACHMENT A [TABLE A1-1]. USE TABLE 
A.  Table organization. [Attachment A], table A1-1, table of permitted uses classifies land uses and activities into general "use categories" and specific "use types" based on common functional or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, types of products, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. Regardless of whether a use is allowed by right or permitted as a special use, there may be additional standards that are applicable to the use. Uses are allowed as follows: 
1.  Permitted by-right uses. "P" in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district and overlay district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations in this document, including the use-specific standards in this section. 
2.  Special uses. "S" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a special use in accordance with the procedures of [section 2.04]. Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this document including the use-specific standards in this section and the requirements of article IV, supplementary district regulations. 
3.  Prohibited uses. A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district. 
B.  Classification by interpretation. This classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories and specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories. The categories are intended merely as an indexing tool for the specific use type and are not regulatory. When application is made for a use type that is not specifically listed in [attachment A], table A1-1, table of permitted uses but that appears similar to uses in that table, the director shall make a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use in the following manner: 
1.  The director shall consider the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity; sales; processing; type of product, storage and amount, and nature thereof; enclosed or open storage; anticipated employment; transportation requirements; the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material, and vibration likely to be generated; and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
2.  Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those applicable to a similar use. 
3.  The director may choose to send a proposed use to the city commission for interpretation where classification options are unclear or where the potential impact must be considered in the interpretation process. 
4.  When the director determines that a new or unanticipated use is so similar in impact to a specific use type, or uses generally within the use category the director may: 
a.  Make the interpretation the use type is generally broad enough to include the use in question; or 
b.  For ease of future application and interpretation add the use to the appropriate category in the table. Such administrative adjustment to the table shall not be considered an amendment to this appendix provided the criterial above are clearly met, and provided notice and comment of the adjustment is placed on the agenda of both the planning commission and governing body for review and consent. 
5.  Appeal of the director's decision shall be made to the city commission.

b.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way. This Contract franchise does not: 
(1)  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party; 
(2)  Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or,

Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property). 
d.  Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573. 
e.  Access to the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.  
Section 3. - Use of public right-of-way. 
a.  Pursuant to K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 17-1902 and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee has the right to construct, maintain and operate its Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
b.  Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way. 
c.  City shall, pursuant to Section 13 of this Contract franchise, provide reasonable advanced notice of the consideration and/or adoption of any rule, regulation, policies, resolutions and ordinances relating to the construction in or use of the Public right-of-way, inasmuch as such adoption affects Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way. 
d.  If requested by the City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, Grantee shall remove, relocate or adjust its Facilities within the Public right-of-way at no cost to the City, providing such request similarly binds all users of such public right-of-way. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any written request by the City for such relocation or adjustment, provided that the City shall provide Grantee with a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days advance written notice to comply with any such removal, relocation or adjustment. Grantee shall designate one (1) person within its organization by his/her employment position to whom relocation notices shall be sent and with whom rests the responsibility to facilitate all necessary communications within Grantee's various areas. 
e.  When the City requests removal, relocation or adjustment of Grantee's Facilities within the Public right-of-way for construction or maintenance activities related to improvements that are, in whole or in part, for private benefit, the City shall require, as a condition of its approval of any request from any private party or parties for alteration of the Public right-of-way, that such private party or parties reimburse Grantee for the cost of removal, relocation or adjustment, in an amount equal to the percentage of the private benefit received. Grantee shall not be obligated to commence the removal, relocation or adjustment until receipt of funds for the costs from such private party or parties. For purposes of this paragraph, a mixed purpose public/private project shall be subject to a presumption of a private benefit of no less than 50 percent. Further, Grantee shall have no liability for delays caused by a private party's failure to reimburse costs. Grantee understands, however, that the City has no obligation to collect such reimbursement. 
f.  Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.  
Section 4. - Compensation to the city. 
a.  In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed the maximum Access line fee allowed by Kansas law. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year. 
b.  Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 12-2001 (m) and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 12-2001 and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee. 
c.  Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
d.  Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
e.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. Subject to any limitations of Kansas Statute, Grantee's payment obligations shall survive the expiration or termination of this Contract franchise. 
f.  The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee. 
g.  Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of $1,000.00. The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Contract franchise. 
h.  The franchise fee required herein pursuant to K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 12-2001(j), shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 17-1902 and amendments thereto. The franchise fee shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
i.  Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance. Such Access line (franchise) fee or Gross Receipts (franchise) fee shall be in the same amount or percentage as the franchise fee set forth in subsection 4 a. hereinabove.  
Section 5. - Annexation or renumbering streets 
The City agrees to provide Grantee with notification in the event that it annexes property into the corporate boundaries of the City that would require Grantee to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the annexation of the property Grantee was not required to pay a franchise fee. The City agrees to provide Grantee with notification in the event the City renumbers or renames any streets that would require Grantee to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the renumbering or renaming of the streets Grantee would not have been required to pay a franchise fee. The City agrees that in the event the City does not provide Grantee with notice of an annexation or renumbering and/or renaming of the streets, Grantee is not liable to the City for payment of franchise fees on the annexation or renumbered and/or renamed streets prior to the City providing notice to Grantee of such.  
Section 6. - Indemnity and hold harmless. 
A  It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., and amendments thereto, it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS: 
 
Section 1. - Intent. 
It is the intent of this franchise ordinance to provide for and specify the means by which the city shall grant to Kansas City Cable Partners, doing business as American Cablevision, and by which American Cablevision will exercise, authority to continue providing cable service and additional service to the Residents of the city. Absent a provision in this franchise ordinance, or other waiver, neither the city nor American Cablevision shall be required to forego any rights it may possess under the First Amendment or any other provision of the United States or Kansas Constitutions, or any statute, regulation, rule or decision of any federal, state or local agency or court having jurisdiction.  
Section 2. - Competition. 
2.01.  Franchise non-exclusive. The right to use and occupy the streets, city facilities and other public property shall not be exclusive. The city reserves the right to grant a similar use of its streets and other public property at any time during the term of the Franchise. The city reserves any right under applicable law to construct, maintain, and operate a cable communications system. 
2.02.  Less restrictive terms. 
A.  Election by American Cablevision. If the city permits such similar use of its streets, city facilities and other public property upon terms and conditions which are less burdensome or more favorable to another operator of a cable communications system than the terms and conditions of this franchise, then American Cablevision may elect to modify this franchise pursuant to the procedures set forth below. 
B.  All provisions considered. In considering whether the terms and conditions of a subsequent franchise are less burdensome or more favorable than the terms and conditions of this franchise, the reasonable value of the requirements of each franchise shall be taken as a whole. 
C.  Procedure. If the terms and conditions of the subsequent franchise are less burdensome or more favorable, then American Cablevision may propose modifications of the requirements in this franchise to the extent that modifications cure the disparity between the two franchises. American Cablevision shall provide the city with written notice of any proposed modifications under this section, and the city shall accept or reject such proposed modifications within 45 days of receipt of such notice. If the city rejects such proposed modifications, American Cablevision and the city may mutually agree to submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant to section 17 of the General Cable Ordinance or either party may seek relief regarding the terms of this franchise in a court of competent jurisdiction. In either case, the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect during the resolution of this dispute. The city shall not unreasonably reject proposed modifications. 
D.  Non-franchised system. If any cable communications system is constructed and/or operated within the city, and the operator of such cable communications system is not required to obtain a franchise therefore, then American Cablevision shall not be required to comply with any terms of this Franchise that are more burdensome or less favorable than any requirements imposed on the operator of such other cable communications system governing the construction, operation or repair of such other cable communications system. The provisions of subsections B. and C. of this section 2.02 shall also apply to actions taken pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any modification of the terms and conditions of this franchise pursuant to this subsection D. the following sections of the General Cable Ordinance shall not be modified by the procedures described herein: section 3 (Sale or Transfer of Franchise), section 4 (Grant of Authority and Use of Streets), section 5 (Conditions of Street Occupancy), section 13 (Liability Insurance), and section 14 (Indemnification). 
E.  Record and reporting changes. If the city or any affiliate of the city shall make a decision to commence construction and operation of a cable communications system in the city, or should construction of a cable communications system by the city or any affiliate of the city commence without an identifiable final decision, then this franchise automatically shall be amended as of the date of the final decision to commence construction and operation, or at the commencement of construction when it begins without an identifiable final decision, in the manner described below. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the General Cable Ordinance or this franchise ordinance, American Cablevision shall not be required to provide the city with proprietary information or to respond to requests for information that require it to release proprietary information where it reasonably believes that the release of such information would provide the city or affiliate of the city a competitive advantage, except as required by federal law or regulations; and 
(2)  Any audits of franchise fees conducted pursuant to section 12 of the General Cable Ordinance must be conducted by an independent auditor who has agreed in advance in writing not to disclose any portion of American Cablevision's books and records or other proprietary information to the city, other than the aggregate amount of gross receipts (without disclosing the amounts of underlying categories of gross receipts) used to calculate the franchise fees payable hereunder.

Section 9. - System improvement. 
Upon the eighth anniversary of the effective date of this franchise, American Cablevision shall make such improvements to the system as are necessary to maintain the System at the modem level of technical performance which has been implemented in a majority of cable television systems, including those served by American Cablevision in the Kansas City metropolitan area, provided that such improvements can be instituted through technology which has been demonstrated to be feasible for its intended purpose, in an operationally workable manner, and in a manner which is profitable with respect to such improvements.  
Section 10. - General cable ordinance controlling. 
By accepting this franchise, American Cablevision agrees to accept and abide by all provisions contained in the city's General Cable Ordinance as it exists on the date hereof. The terms and provision of American Cablevision's Franchise may not be amended or modified in any respect including by the modification of the City's General Cable Ordinance, except as set forth in section 15 of this franchise ordinance.  
Section 11. - Franchise fee. 
A.  Use of streets/cost of regulation. In consideration of the rights, powers, privileges, permission and authority granted by this franchise ordinance and the General Cable Ordinance, for use of the city's streets and other public property, American Cablevision shall pay to the city an amount equal to five percent of its gross receipts received from the operation of the system in the city; provided, however, that should applicable federal law change so that the city may levy a higher franchise fee, and the law continues to specify a limit on franchise fee payments, the city may, by ordinance, modify this section to require payment by grantee of an amount up to the percentage of its gross receipts received from the operation of the system in the city that is allowed under federal law. If applicable federal law permits the city to levy a higher franchise fee, but no limit is specified, then the city may, by ordinance, modify this section to require payment by grantee of an amount up to eight percent of its gross receipts received from the operation of the system in the city. The city represents that this amount represents compensation for the cost of reasonable regulation permitted or mandated by federal law, and for the use of the streets and public property by American Cablevision. American Cablevision is entitled to rely upon the city's representation in the payment of this franchise fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing franchise fee provisions, with respect to any additional service that already was being provided in the city by another person or persons at the time American Cablevision first began providing that additional service in the city, the gross receipts derived by American Cablevision from the additional service shall be excluded from the franchise fee calculation described above, and American Cablevision shall pay franchise fees to the city with respect to the additional service at the same rate and on the same basis as the pre-existing provider or providers of that additional service. 
B.  Permit and license fees. Payment of franchise fees shall be in lieu of all subsequent permit and license fees or charges required by the city, insofar as this franchise ordinance does not require additional payment. 
C.  Revenue not from operation of system. This franchise ordinance does not excuse the payment of any occupational license fee, charge or tax relating to any business endeavor for which American Cablevision is not obligated to pay a Franchise fee. 
D.  Taxes of general applicability. This franchise ordinance does not prohibit the city from imposing on American Cablevision, as part of a group of businesses or activities, any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability that is not unduly discriminatory against operators of cable communications systems or their subscribers. 
E.  Payment to city. Payment due city under this provision shall be computed at the end of each calendar year. Payments shall be due and payable for the preceding 12 months on or before March 31. Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement of income revenue earned for the year in connection with the operation of the system in Leavenworth, Kansas and a brief report showing the basis for computation of fees and such other relevant facts as may be required by city. Payment of annual franchise fees shall be in lieu of all occupational, permit and license fees imposed by the city. 
F.  Acceptance of payment not accord or release. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this franchise ordinance. All amounts paid by American Cablevision shall be subject to audit by the city, at the city's expense, in accordance with the terms of the General Cable Ordinance. 
G.  Late payment. In the event that any payment is not made on or before the applicable date fixed in this section, American Cablevision shall pay, as additional compensation, an interest charge, computed from such date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate in effect upon the due date plus two percentage points. The prime rate will be determined by the Commerce Bank of Kansas City, or its successor, on the effective date on which interest becomes due. 
H.  Early termination of franchise. In the event the Franchise is terminated for any reason before its scheduled expiration, the franchise fee shall be prorated to reflect the time elapsed since the last payment was made to the city. American Cablevision shall pay to the city not later than 30 days following termination of the franchise the required percentage of gross receipts.  
Section 12. - Subsequent action by state or federal bodies. 
It is the intent of the city and American Cablevision that the terms, conditions and obligations set forth in the General Cable Ordinance and this franchise ordinance shall govern their relationship for the full term of the franchise. In the event that any court, agency commission, or other authority of competent jurisdiction: (1) declares the General Cable Ordinance or this franchise ordinance invalid, in whole or in part, or (2) requires American Cablevision either to: (a) perform any act which is inconsistent with any provision of the General Cable Ordinance or this Franchise Ordinance, or (b) cease performing any act required by any provision of the General Cable Ordinance or this franchise ordinance, then American Cablevision shall not be required to comply with any term declared invalid and shall comply with any such requirement.  
Section 13. - Severability. 
If any provision of the General Cable Ordinance or this franchise ordinance is held by a court or by any federal or state agency to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, the conflicting provision shall be considered to be a separate, distinct and independent part of the General Cable Ordinance or this ordinance, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision of the General Cable Ordinance or this franchise ordinance.  
Section 14. - Written notice. 
All notices, reports or demands required to be given in writing under this franchise ordinance shall be deemed to be given when delivered personally to American Cablevision's chief executive officer or to the franchise administrator or when 48 hours have elapsed after it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, with registered or certified mail postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the party to which notice is being given.

APPENDIX 1. - SYSTEM UPGRADE DESCRIPTION AND TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
American Cablevision shall upgrade the system it currently operates in the city. 
The upgrade shall provide Leavenworth residents with a technically advanced and reliable cable communications system. The system shall operate with 750 MHz of bandwidth, capable of delivering a minimum of 78 analog channels plus 200 MHz of digital capacity for delivery of advanced services such as interactivity, compressed video, and other telecommunications. It will have a return capacity of 10-42 MHz. The design will provide the benefits of proven 78 channel electronics while positioning the system for expansion of bandwidth and channel capacity as technology and future services develop. A purpose of this upgrade, in addition to increasing the technical capabilities and reliability of the system, is to provide the capacity for increased channels available to subscribers. 
The design of the system shall be based upon a "fiber to the feeder" architecture. This architecture will deliver the signals by fiber optics directly to each neighborhood group. With a neighborhood group average of only 500 homes, the resulting system will have improved reliability while delivering a high quality picture. 
American Cablevision will place fiber optic cables throughout the city, delivering the signals to an optical node placed in each neighborhood area. Each optical node will provide cable service through no more than seven amplifiers in any direction from that node. Should any equipment failures occur, the number of homes which could be affected would total no more than the number of homes fed off of any single node. The incorporation of standby power supplies, strategically placed throughout the system, will further reduce the likelihood of service interruptions. 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
A.  The system shall be capable of meeting the following distortion parameters with a maximum cascade of 7 amplifiers: 
1.  Carrier to RMS Noise ..... 47 dB 
2.  Carrier to Second Order ..... 53 dB 
3.  Carrier to Cross Modulation ..... 53 dB 
4.  Carrier to Composite Beat ..... 53 dB 
B.  The frequency versus gain response of a single channel as measured across any 6 MHz spectrum shall not exceed +/- 2 dB. 
C.  The frequency versus gain response of the entire passband shall not exceed n/10 + 2 dB for the entire system where n is the number of amplifiers in a cascade. 
D.  The system shall be designed such that at a minimum all technical specifications of this franchise are met. 
E.  The system shall be designed such that no noticeable degradation in signal quality will appear at the subscriber terminal.
