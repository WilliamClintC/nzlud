that individual may apply to the Commission for a written advisory opinion. The individual
shall be given an opportunity to present his or her interpretation of the facts at issue and of

situation in which some action or non-action by that individual will affect the Town and that
individual believes that he or she may have a conflict or apparent conflict and time is of the
essence, that individual may obtain from the Chairperson of the Commission a written
temporary advisory opinion. Reliance thereon shall mean that that individual shall not be
found to have violated this chapter. The Commission shall be convened within 15 days and

ratify of modify that opinion. Upon the action of the Commission, the temporary opinion, as

protect the aquifer within said areas by:
Restricting, prohibiting, or controlling uses, including but not limited to deposit, removal or storage
of materials, construction of structures or buildings, and any other works which are dangerous to
health, safety or property in times of flood, cause increases in flood heights or velocities, or are
likely to pollute groundwater;
Requiring that permitted uses vulnerable to flood, including public facilities, shall be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction, thereby reducing damage due to flooding,
and the need for investment in flood-control projects;
Ensuring that potential buyers will have the opportunity of identifying land within the flood hazard
area;
Minimizing surface water and groundwater pollution which will affect human, animal, or plant life;
Helping to maintain a stable tax base through the preservation of property values by reducing the
potential of future flood blight areas;
Providing for public awareness of the potential for flooding and harm to the aquifer; and
Protecting the aquifer for use as a public water supply by limiting the amount of impervious
surface within the floodplain areas and reducing the effect of de-icing salts, chemicals and other
pollutants.

§ 181-7. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions, or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Burlington or any commissioner, officer,
or employee thereof for any damages that may result from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
§ 181-8. Administration; general standards.
The Town Building Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of
this program. The devices and responsibilities of the Town Building Inspector are as follows:
To review permits to assure sites are reasonably safe from flooding.

and Army Corps of Engineers for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
federal or state law.
To require new construction and substantial improvements in flood-prone areas to be
constructed using flood-resistant materials.
The Town Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission will notify abutting communities and
the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
copies of such notification to the Flood Insurance Administration.
The Town Building Inspector will notify adjacent communities and the Department of Energy and
Environmental Protection prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to FEMA.
[Amended 4-23-2019]
The Town Building Inspector will notify the regional planning agency and the affected municipality
at least 35 days prior to the public hearing if any change of regulation or use of a flood zone will
affect an area within 500 feet of another municipality.
Construction stage. Upon completion of the applicable portion of construction the applicant shall
provide the Building Inspector with verification of the as-built lowest floor elevation, defined as the
top of the lowest floor including basement or, in the case of floodproofed buildings, the elevation to
which the floodproofing is effective.
General standards.
New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damage.
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

§ 181-11. Special exceptions.
Substantial improvements or additions to existing structures or accessory structures or fill will be
permitted by the Building Inspector only as a special exception in the flood-fringe areas, if authorized
by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and will conform to the provisions of these regulations,
provided that:
All substantial improvements, additions or accessory structures to residential structures within
unnumbered A Zones on a community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
above the base flood elevation as obtained from alternate sources.
All substantial improvements, additions or accessory structures to nonresidential structures within
unnumbered A Zones on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated or floodproofed above the base flood elevation as obtained from alternate sources. For
all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage have permanent openings
designed to allow the entry and exit of floodwaters.
All substantial improvements or additions to residential structures or accessory structures within
Zones A1-30 on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above
the base flood level.
All substantial improvements, additions or accessory structures to nonresidential structures within
Zones A1-30 on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or
above the base flood level, or be floodproofed above that level.
Within Zones A1-30, all manufactured homes will provide that:
Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the

The placement of mobile homes, except in an existing mobile home park or mobile home
subdivision, is prohibited in the floodway.
A volume of material equal to that added to the site below the base flood elevation plus that
volume displaced by the structure below the base flood elevation plus any volume enclosed within
the structure below the base flood elevation shall be removed from an equal or lower elevation
than that upon which the construction is proposed. The material will then be moved to an elevation
above that of the base flood.
The area of the site covered by a proposed improvement, addition, or accessory structure shall be
no more than 25% of the area of the site covered by the existing building of principal use, as long
as the pertinent requirements of this section are met. A special exception granted under these
conditions shall be on a one-time only basis.
The applicant provides the Commission with a report prepared by a professional engineer
registered in the State of Connecticut that certifies that the construction, as proposed, will not
adversely affect the storage capacity or flow capacity of the affected watercourse during a base
flood.
Where floodproofing is utilized for a particular nonresidential structure, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Connecticut shall certify that the floodproofing methods are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impacts, and uplift forces.
Nonresidential structures located in all A Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated
provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure
below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects to buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction and
shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable
standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be
provided to the Building Inspector.
Floodways. Located within special flood hazard areas established in this chapter are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential,
no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
developments, shall be permitted unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that enroachments shall not result
in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Fences located in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A
permit may be given which allows enroachments resulting in increases in base flood
elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the
requirement of 44 CFR 65.12 (Burlington Regulations/Section 11K).
Standards for streams without established base flood elevations, floodway and/or flood
mapping.
The Building Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to the Town's Subdivision Regulations, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the
Community's FIRM meets the standards in this chapter.
In A Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is
designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one

foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered
cumulatively with the proposed development.
The Building Inspector may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses
without FEMA published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or
whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the Town's
request or not), the Town shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that
the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the
water surface elevation more than one foot at any point along the watercourse.
The Building Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source as criteria for
requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in any
area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community meet the
standards in this chapter.
In the event that elimination of a structure takes place, by reason of fire or other like catastrophe,
and is subsequently replaced with a new structure of like kind and intended use, this will be
allowed to the extent that the building coverage will not exceed 125% of the displaced building
coverage, as long as all requirements of pertinent subsections of this section are met.
Outside of the floodway, land may be used for agricultural and amusement purposes; structure, if
any, may be allowed upon application, and only as permitted under these regulations.
Any fill in the flood hazard area will be displaced by removing an equal volume of material from an
equal or lower elevation so that the net change to the retention capacity remains constant, and
that the material be removed to an elevation above that of the base flood.
Commercial or industrial loading areas, parking areas for more than three vehicles, or airport
landing strips are in accordance with the pertinent subsections of this section.
§ 181-12. Variances.
No variances will be granted for a principal structure and/or an accessory structure after one year.
Variances to these regulations allowing construction of a principal structure and/or accessory
structure within the flood-fringe area will not be issued if any increase in flood heights or velocities
would result.
If a variance is issued to construct a principal structure and/or accessory structure within the floodfringe
areas, increased premium rates for flood insurance will result as such construction within
the flood-fringe area increases risk to life and property.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character
and result in the loss of historic designation of the building.
Variances may be allowed provided that:
The parcel of land is a lot of record on file in the Town Clerk's office before the effective date
of these regulations.
A landowner makes application to the Town Building Inspector on forms provided by him for a
variance to the above-listed regulations, provided that:
He demonstrates that the parcel is unique.

Strict enforcement of the regulations would cause an undue hardship.
Only hardships which are based on unusual physical characteristics of the property
in question, characteristics which are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall qualify to
meet Subsection E(2)(b) above. Claims of hardship based on the structure, on
economics or on personal circumstances are not sufficient cause for the granting of
a variance under this chapter.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying
the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation up to amounts as high as $25 or $100 of insurance coverage.
The local Building Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeals actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
Granting of a variance would not result in increased flood heights, cause increased or
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
Creating a variance would not change the character of the neighborhood.
Data supplied is certified to be substantially correct and a true representation of existing
conditions by a professional engineer registered in the State of Connecticut.
An extension of the above time variance to these regulations may be allowed for construction of a
principal structure and/or an accessory structure within the flood-fringe area when permission for
this construction has been granted by the Burlington Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the
adoption of these regulations. This variance is with regard to the extension of the time within which
to construct, and shall not exceed the initial five-year period allowed by the Town Planning and
Zoning Commission.
Variances for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed in the National
Register of Historical Places or the State Inventory of Historical Places may be issued without
regard to any time limitation contained in this section.
§ 181-13. Conflicting provisions; severability.
All provisions of the Town Code in conflict herewith are hereby repealed, and if for any reason any
word, clause, paragraph or section of this chapter shall be held to make the same unconstitutional, this
chapter shall not hereby be invalidated and the remainder of this chapter shall continue in effect. Any
provision herein which is in conflict with the Connecticut General Statutes is hereby repealed, it being
understood that said statutes shall take precedence over this chapter.
§ 181-14. Savings clause.
The enactment of this chapter shall not operate as an abatement of an action or proceeding pending
under or by virtue of any prior ordinance, Selectmen vote, or special act.

Federal and state laws and regulations mandate that drainage designs comply with Federal Clean
Water Act of 1977, Phase II, Final Rule, concerning stormwater. The Town of Burlington
encourages the use of any approved water quality control options specified in the federal and
state laws. Such structures control the quantity of flow and contain sand, silt, dirt and other solids.
For maximum performance, these structures require substantial periodic maintenance.
However, for some land subject to development and construction, producing zero increase in the
rate of discharge of water from one property to another compels drainage designs that provide for
the inclusion of detention basins, separators or similar earthen or other solid embankments, dams
or other stormwater pollutant removal mechanisms as listed in Table 3-2 of the 2004 Connecticut
Stormwater Quality Manual. The purpose of this article is to set forth the Town's policy as to such
structures and the costs associated with and created by their use and required maintenance.
§ 256-2. Findings and policy.
Should the design requirements of the laws and regulations require the construction of structures
such as detention basins, separators or similar earthen or other solid embankments, dams or
other stormwater pollutant removal mechanisms designed in compliance with the Connecticut
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Stormwater Phase II (MS4) Program based
on the Federal Clean Water Act of 1977 as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-
4), Section 402, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES), Phase II, Final Rule
("facility" or "facilities"), the Town of Burlington will not accept title to such facilities as additions to
its municipally owned drainage system as "improvements."
Such facilities require special, periodic maintenance to clean out sand, silt, dirt, debris or other
foreign material in order to keep the structure operating as designed. Most of these facilities are
not located within roads or streets that are designed and planned to become public roads of the
Town of Burlington and are not within the road drainage system regularly accepted by the Town.
Additionally, such facilities may impose excessive, unbudgeted costs upon the taxpayers of the
Town. Finally, such facilities, if not maintained, may fail, imposing possible further liability on the
Town.
As it is in the best interest of its citizens and the Town to ensure that the required maintenance is
performed and as its Highway Department has the technical and physical ability to provide the
maintenance required of these facilities, it is, subject to provision for the capitalization of the costs
of periodic maintenance, deemed appropriate that the Town provide the maintenance of
designated facilities. However, the Town finds that it is not reasonable to expect or require
individual homeowners or limited groups of homeowners to provide the periodic maintenance that
these systems require or pay for the cost thereof.
Therefore, it has been and is the position of the Town that the costs of this periodic maintenance
ought to be placed upon those persons causing the need for this maintenance and who benefit
from these facilities rather than upon the taxpayers as a whole. Future costs of the maintenance of
these facilities shall be an expense of those landowner(s), developer(s) or subdivider(s) benefiting
from the development of the property upon which the facilities are located. Provision for this future
cost shall be accomplished by the establishment of a fund reasonably calculated to generate
sufficient income to pay the cost of using the Highway Department to maintain these facilities
(herein "Maintenance Fund").
§ 256-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

A.
Clean water regulations promulgated by the Connecticut Department of Energy and
Environmental Protection that define the standards for design of drainage systems discharging
into the waters of the State of Connecticut.
DETENTION BASIN
A drainage structure designed to avoid downstream flash flooding, receiving and collecting storm
and drainage water, whether surface or subsurface, within a defined area and releasing that water
in a controlled manner essentially equivalent to the rate of flow from property in its natural state
prior to development.
LAND OWNER, DEVELOPER or SUBDIVIDER
The person, individual or business who or which owns the land upon which any facility is to be
constructed or who or which has applied to a land use board or commission for a permit or other
approval which includes construction of any facility or has received application approval or been
granted a permit by one or more of the land use agencies or commissions of the Town of
Burlington to develop property including the installation of one or more facilities. The term or
terms, singular or plural, "land owner," "developer" and "subdivider" are like terms with the same
meaning herein.
SEPARATOR
A drainage structure designed to collect water in a confined area and cause solid particles of
sand, silt, dirt and foreign material to be separated from the water before the water is released
downstream from the confined area.
§ 256-4. Identification of facilities.
Prior to approval of any development project by any Town land use boards or commissions
("agencies"), a developer shall, with the assistance of the Town Engineer, identify any facilities as
specified in this article that will require special periodic maintenance in the future.
§ 256-5. Access easement; Maintenance Fund.
As conditions precedent to temporary or final approval from any land use agencies, the developer
shall be responsible for preparing and executing an access easement and the establishment with
the Town of the Maintenance Fund.
The access easement shall be from an accepted Town road to the facility for maintenance
and repair purposes including a designated easement area around the perimeter of the facility
in favor of the Town. The proposed deed of easement must be acceptable to the Town
Counsel. Delivery to the Town of an executed and accepted deed of easement is also a
condition precedent to acceptance of any drainage system and of responsibility on the part of
the Town for periodic maintenance.
The Town Engineer and the Foreman of the Highway Department shall establish an annual
cost ("cost") to perform the required periodic maintenance on the facilities. The Town
Treasurer, with input from the Town Engineer, shall then calculate a sum necessary to
capitalize that annual cost based upon the following formula. The cost shall become the
numerator of a fraction the denominator of which shall be a sum arrived at by the subtraction
of the yearly average of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)* from the yearly average yield of tenyear
United States Treasury notes ("notes")**. The resulting quotient, after dividing the
numerator by the denominator, shall be the sum required to be deposited with the Town as
the Maintenance Fund.
* The yearly average of the CPI shall be determined by taking each published yearly
average beginning with 1953 up to and including the most recent published yearly

average, adding the averages together and dividing the total by the number of years
included.
** The yearly average yield of the notes shall be determined by taking each published
yearly average yield beginning with 1953 up to and including the most recent
published yearly average yield, adding the average yields together and dividing the
total by the number of years included.
The developer shall pay the Town such sum before temporary or final approval by Town agencies,
the acceptance by the Town of the drainage system and before any performance bond is reduced
to a maintenance level.
The Town shall forthwith deliver the full sum to the Treasurer who shall deposit that sum in a
separately identified account referred to as the Maintenance Fund for __________ (name of
project or subdivision - phase as appropriate), shown on a map or plan titled "__________", dated
_____, 20 _____ and recorded in the office of the Town Clerk at map volume _____, page _____.
Such a fund shall be maintained indefinitely for the purpose of providing revenue to pay for the
periodic maintenance required. Funds shall not be commingled with the general funds or
investments of the Town but may be commingled with maintenance funds from similar projects.
The capital shall not be used for any operating expense.
§ 256-6. Maintenance responsibility.
Upon establishment of the Maintenance Fund by the land developer, completion of any required
performance bond period, and acceptance by the Town of the drainage system within which are
located such facilities, the Town shall thereafter assume full maintenance and repair responsibility
for the identified facilities, but not title thereto. There shall be no further accounting as to the cost
of maintenance of any particular facility nor rebate if the expense is less than the income or
additional charge if the expense if greater.
This policy does not apply to roads or piped drainage systems within roads including off-road
discharges not pertaining to any facilities. Establishment of such a fund does not constitute
acceptance of title to the facilities referred to above by the Town.
§ 256-7. Administration.
The Board of Selectmen shall control the Maintenance Fund and shall direct the income as
appropriate to the Highway Department for the purpose of providing maintenance to the identified
facilities.
There shall be no accounting among developers or properties that have contributed to this fund
and no requirement that the maintenance be provided to particular facilities except as determined
by the Highway Department.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; not does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, alterations, additions or other improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten (10) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure as determined at the beginning of such ten (10) year period. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage', regardless of the actual repair work performed. For purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement' is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local: code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (2) Any alteration of a "historic" structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a “historic structure”.

G. FLOOD PLAIN
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE
1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-148(c)(7)(A) and in Title 8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Burlington, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:
2. FINDING OF FACT The flood hazard areas of the Town of Burlington are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.
The Town of Burlington has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since 6/1/1981. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to receive federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
a. To protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;
b. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
c. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. To minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
e. To minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain;
f. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas;
29
g. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;
h. To prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners;
i. To ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions; and
j. To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
4. OBJECTIVES In order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
d. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
5. DEFINITIONS: See Section II. INTERPRETATIONS, C. DEFINITIONS
6. GENERAL PROVISIONS
a. AREAS TO WHICH THIS REGULATION APPLIES This regulation shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) within the Town of Burlington.
b. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS (SFHA) The Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the Town of Burlington dated September 26, 2008, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and/or Flood Boundary And Floodway Maps (FBFM), dated September 26, 2008, and other supporting data, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA.
30
The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A, A1-30, AE, AO, and AH, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM or FBFM. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. Also included are areas of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding, including any area contiguous with but outside the SFHA identified by FEMA, and where the land surface elevation is lower than the base flood elevation (BFE) as shown in the FIS, and the area is not protected from flooding by a natural or man-made feature. The FIRM, FBFM and FIS are on file in the Planning and Zoning Office of the Town of Burlington.
c. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD A structure or development already in compliance with this regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration, modification, repair, reconstruction or improvement and must also comply with other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, modified or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable regulations.
d. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
e. INTERPRETATION In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions shall be: 1) considered as minimum requirements; 2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; 3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.
f. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research, larger floods can and will occur on, rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Burlington or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. The Town of Burlington, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for another person's reliance on any maps, data or information provided by the Town of Burlington.
31
g. SEVERABILITY If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this regulation should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this regulation, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the provisions of this regulation are hereby declared to be severable.

8. PROVISIONS FOR FLOODHAZARD REEDUCTION
a. GENERAL STANDARDS In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) the following provisions are required:
1. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
2. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
3. New construction, substantial improvements, and repairs to structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
4. New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water.
5. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HVAC ductwork, and other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing a structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE) to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This includes, but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical junction boxes, and circuit breaker boxes.
6. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
7. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges from the system into flood Waters.
8. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
9. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
36
10. In any portion of a watercourse that is altered or relocated, the flood carrying capacity must be maintained. Notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Inland Water Resources Division prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.
11. If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
12. If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., W zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
13. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
14. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an
37
increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
b. STANDARDS FOR WATERCOURSES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD EVALATIONS (UN-NUMBERED A ZONE), ADOPTED FLOODWAYSAND/OR FLOOD MAPPING
1. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require base flood elevation (BFE) data be provide with any application for new construction, substantial improvement, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development in Zone A without a FEMA-published BFE (un-numbered A Zone). The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data developed for subdivision proposals, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development in un-numbered A Zones on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) meet the standards in Section III.G.6.d and Section III.G.8.c If no BFE can be determined, the lowest floor, including basement, must be elevated to three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade next to the structure.
2. When BFEs have been determined within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM but a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Zoning Enforcement Officer must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community when all existing and anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
3. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the municipality's request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community.
4. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development in any area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community meet the standards in Section III.G.6.d and Section III.G.8.c.
5. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may
38
approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one (1.0) foot, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.
c. SPECIFIC STANDARDS
1. Construction Standards in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), Zones A, A1-30, AE.
a. Residential Construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage which are residential structures shall have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE). Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure must be elevated to one foot above the BFE.
b. Non-Residential Construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage which are commercial, industrial or non-residential structures shall: a) Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation (BFE); or b) In lieu of being elevated, non-residential structures may be dry flood-proofed to one (1) foot above the BFE provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and provided that such structures are composed of structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Connecticut registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice 15 for meeting the provisions of this section. Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Enforcement Officer on the FEMA Flood proofing Certificate, Form 81 65. c) Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure must be elevated to one foot above the BFE.
c. Fully Enclosed Areas Below The Base Flood Elevation. Of Elevated Buildings. All new construction, substantial improvements, or repair of Substantial damage to residential or non-residential
39
structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by a foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation (BFE) of an elevated building, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and be designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls (wet flood-proofing). Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a Connecticut registered professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed in sections (a)-(g) below: a) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two different walls. Only the area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used in the calculation of net area of vents required. If the structure has more than one enclosed area, openings must be installed in the exterior walls of each enclosed area so that flood waters can enter directly from the outside;
b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. At least one side of the structure's fully enclosed area must be at or above grade. Fill placed around the foundation walls must be graded so that the elevation inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least one side of the building. The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no lower than the bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation slab of a residential structure, including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the outside finished grade on at least one side of the building;
c) The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in both directions without any external influence or control such as human intervention, including the use of electrical and other non-automatic mechanical means. Other coverings may be designed and certified by an engineer or approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. d) The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary and shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not be used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms;
40
e) All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall be unfinished and resistant to flood damage.
f) Electrical, plumbing, HVAC ductwork, machinery or other utility equipment and connections that service the structure (including, but not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation, washers, dryers, electrical junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers) are prohibited in the fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates.
g) A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab below the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the standards of Sections III.G.8.c.1.c (a)-(f). A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFF, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage doors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding occurs is not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In addition to the automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE must be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to non-residential structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or be dry flood proofed as per the requirements of Section III.G.8.c.3.
2. Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RVs).
a. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home must also meet all the construction standards per Section III.G.8.c. This includes SFHAs outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.
b. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be
41
limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
c. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than six (6) feet above ground level.
d. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, OR (iii) meet all the general standard of Section III.G.8.a and the elevation and anchoring requirement of Section III.G.8.c.2.a, III.G.8.c.2.b, and III.G.8.c.2.c. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
e. Floodways located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas designated as floodways on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM). Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, repairs to substantially damaged structures and other developments shall be permitted unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A permit may be given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirements of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1, and Subsection 65.12.
9. DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
If a proposed subdivision, including the placement of a manufactured home park or subdivision, is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) the following requirements shall apply:
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
42
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
d. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis performed by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer that generates BFEs for all subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require the applicant to provide BFE data for all subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, as per Section III.G.7.l.
10. VARIANCE PROCEDURES
a. ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCESS
1. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Town of Burlington shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this regulation. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer in the enforcement or administration of this regulation.
2. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or any person owning land which abuts or is within a radius of one hundred (100) feet of the land in question may appeal within fifteen (15) days after such decision to the State Superior Court of Litchfield as provided in Section 8-8 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.
3. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.
b. SPECIFIC SITUATION VARIANCES
1. Buildings on a Historic Register - Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or any locally-adopted historic district without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation.
2. Functionally Dependent Use or Facility - Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use or facility provided the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
43
damage, creates no additional threat to public safety and meet all the requirements of Section 10.d.
3. Floodway Prohibition - Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
c. CONSIDERATIONS FOR GRANTING OF VARIANCES In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this regulation and the items listed below as III.G.10.c.1 – III.G.10.c.11. Upon consideration of these factors and the purposes of this regulation, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this regulation.
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
6. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
9. The safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
d. CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES
1. Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building and result in the loss of historic designation of the building. Variances
44
pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause for a variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or disapproval of one’s neighbors.
2. Variances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, ordinances or regulations. Only hardships that are based on unusual or unique physical characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall quality to meet subsection (ii) above. Claims of hardship based on the structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance.
3. No variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any increase in the 100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a “functionally dependent use” provided that there is good and sufficient cause for providing relief; and the variance does not cause a rise in the 100-year flood level within a regulatory floodway. The structure and other development must be protected by methods that minimize flood damages.
4. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.
11. ENFORCEMENT
a. Each Floodplain Permit shall authorize, as a condition of approval, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or designated agents to make regular inspections of the subject property. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or designated agents are also authorized to inspect any property in a
45
Special Hazard Area (SFHA) where it appears that violations of these regulations may be taking place.
b. If the Zoning Enforcement Officer finds that any person is undertaking any construction, substantial improvement, filling, or any other activity or maintaining a condition which in violation of these regulations, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall:
1. Issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the subject property owner, ordering that the activity cease and ordering the property owner to either seed to obtain a Floodplain Permit prior to continuing with the activity or, if appropriate, ordering that all violations and/or obstructions be removed from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) immediately.
2. Notify the Building Official and request that any Building permit(s) in force be revoked or suspended and that a stop work order be issued.
3. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may suspend or revoke a Floodplain Development Permit if it is found that the applicant has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of work as set forth in the application including application plans. Prior to revoking any permit, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct which warrants the intended action.
4. Failure to comply with any written order issued under this section shall be considered a violation of these regulations and is subject to the penalties described in Section III.G.12.
5. In the event violations or obstructions are not promptly removed from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the Zoning Enforcement Officer may cause such removal and remediation work to be performed utilizing bond money held in escrow pursuant to Section III.G.6 of this regulation, or may direct the Director of Public Works or appropriate agent to cause such work to be done and to place a lien against the property.
6. Any person subjected to enforcement action pursuant to this Regulation, may appeal any requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Enforcement Officer to the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with Section III.G.9 of this regulation. Such person shall provide such information as necessary including appropriate certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in order to substantiate the claim that the requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Enforcement Officer was in error or unwarranted.
7. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the owner of a residential dwelling, commercial or industrial building existing at the time off the adoption of this regulation from repairing, replacing or restoring said building or the components thereof to substantially
46
the same character and form as existed at the time of such adoption.
12. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION Any violation of the provisions of this regulation or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grant of variances or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this regulation or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined a penalty of $250.00 per day and in addition shall pay all costs and reasonable legal fees involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Burlington from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

APPENDIX B CENTRAL BUSINESS OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
1. GENERAL
The Burlington Central Business Overlay Zone is an overlay zone encompassing all zoned Central Business Districts. The use of land, buildings and other structures within a Central Business Zone Overlay District shall be conducted in conformity with the underlying Central Business District Regulations and with these additional Central Business Overlay Zone Regulations and Burlington Central Business District Design Guidelines. No lot shall be used, any new building constructed, or any existing building substantially improved or enlarged until the Commission makes a determination that it complies with the procedures and informational requirements of this Section.
In the event of any conflict between the Central Business Zone Regulations and the Central Business Overlay Zone Regulations and Design Guidelines, the Commission’s interpretation of its regulations shall be final. It is the Commissions intent that these regulations augment, not supersede, existing zoning regulations; the requirements of the underlying zoning regulations shall prevail.
Central Business District means any zoning district designated “Central Business Zone” (“CB”) as established by the Burlington Zoning Regulations and the “Zoning Map Town of Burlington” as amended.
2. PURPOSE
The purpose of these Central Business Overlay Zone Regulations is to promote and accommodate revitalization and aesthetic enhancements and to provide for design review within the Central Business Overlay Zone. This review is not intended to discourage or prohibit the use of property. Rather, its purpose is to enhance the character, landscape and architecture quality of Central Business District consistent with the Plan of Conservation and Development and the Burlington Central Business District Design Guidelines to promote economic development and growth objectives.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of these regulations are to:
a. Make recommendations for an appropriate pattern and form of compatible land uses; preclude certain inappropriate and inconsistent uses and activities; and, encourage, oversee and guide development in Central Business Districts.
b. Assist property owners and developers; ensure review of proposals for coordination and conformity with other existing and future development.
c. Encourage State and local government to make necessary public infrastructure improvements.
d. Encourage, assist and coordinate efforts of private and quasi-public groups, such as an association of business merchants, a garden club, service organization or other group, in their efforts to maintain an attractive, cohesive and safe central business district.
114
4. ACTIVITIES AND USES COVERED

f. Permit off-site parking within the street right-of-way for a limited number of spaces if the Commission determines that the location of the spaces improves street level retail uses, improves pedestrian access, is safe and/or will not impede traffic.
116
8. TRAFFIC AND PARKING MANAGEMENT PLAN
Applicants for Site Plan approval in a Central Business District may be required, at the Commissions discretion, to submit a Traffic and Parking Management Plan which addresses the following. No such study need be provided unless requested.
a. Traffic impact analysis containing present roadway conditions, existing and projected traffic volumes (ADT, A.M. and P.M. Peaks), existing volume capacity ratios, existing and projected levels of services, site generated traffic and distribution and accident experience.

9. DESIGN GUIDELINES
The desired image or theme for Burlington’s Central Business Districts is the New England village. This theme is associated with certain visual elements and organizing principles. The retention of a central town green and the enhancement of a consistent look or architectural theme in a Central Business District is a conscious goal herein.
a. Architectural styles are to have a colonial theme with a strong sense of history and tradition. Building materials may include clapboard, shingle, brick and stone. Roofs are flat or steeply pitched. Fenestration is to be vertically proportioned.
b. Modern buildings undergoing renovation, improvement or enlargement or new construction should be renovated or constructed with compatible materials, colors and signage, consistent with the standards set throughout the Central Business District.
10. SIGNAGE
In order to accommodate both pedestrian and vehicular signage needs, a hierarchical signage system for any Central Business District is established. Larger signs may be located to announce the district, extend welcome, indicate merchants located within, and give directions to public parking. This may occur, for example, at strategically located “gateway” elements. Once within the District, individual store signs can identify the merchandise available within. These pedestrian signs should be smaller scaled and appropriately sized for the storefront they announce. Larger and more garish signs are usually associated with the commercial strip and the automobile and are to be discouraged and not allowed. Backlit, translucent canopies, neon, flashing digital signs or other similar signs should be discouraged and not utilized.
Signs must be constructed and placed in conformity with the Burlington Zoning Regulations and must be located so they do not obscure architectural features of historic buildings. In order to create some sense of harmony throughout the District, the same design criteria should be applied to all buildings.
117
APPENDIX C BURLINGTON CENTRAL BUSINESS ZONE DESIGN GUIDELINES
1. BUILDING PLACEMENT
a. The placement of buildings towards the front of the lot and parking space to the rear is strongly encouraged.
b. Primary entrances to buildings should be oriented toward the front sidewalk and street.
2. BUILDING ARTICULATION
a. The building street wall must provide significant modulation in horizontal and vertical rhythms that facilitates a lively relationship between materials, light, shadow, texture, and solids and voids. Such modulation may include, but is not limited to: windows; doors; building bulb-outs; building recesses; façade materials; and specific architectural elements such as columns, cornices, sills, distinct bands between floors, and other ornamentation. As a general rule, building modulations should occur at least every 25 to 30 feet of street wall length.
b. Buildings shall have a significant level of transparency along the ground floor fronting on any sidewalk or street. In general, the ground floor façade should be broken up by windows, doors, or other transparent elements that are subdivided appropriately, where practical. Utilization of plate glass is permitted but the inclusion of grills or other means of creating the look of small panes is strongly encouraged.
c. Mechanical equipment located outside of a building must be screened from view on all sides in a manner that is architecturally consistent and integrative with the associated building.
d. Flat roofs are discouraged. Roof treatments shall be harmonious with the built form of the surrounding area. Cornices, roof terraces and other architectural elements that aid in visually terminating the roofline of a building are strongly encouraged and shall be continued around the entire perimeter of the building.
e. Bay windows, balconies, and other functional or ornamental architectural elements may project a maximum of three (3) feet beyond the front property set-back line. Awnings must be professionally manufactured and mounted. They must be well maintained, and the awning frame must be located no lower than seven feet six inches (7’6”) above the ground. Bright colors are acceptable, but gaudy or loud patterns on awnings are not allowed.
3. FAÇADE DESIGN
a. Façade material for buildings within the Central Business Zone should reflect the preponderance of material types used in the center of Burlington. The use of brick, stone and wood in the building façades is strongly encouraged. Other materials may be utilized provided they produce a level of detailing and quality construction consistent with building façades of brick, stone and wood.
b. The colors of façade materials of a building should generally coordinate with, but not necessarily match, the colors used in other building façades along the same block. Unusual, bright, or contrasting colors should be limited to the details of the building façade.
118
4. PARKING
a. Surface parking lots should be located to the rear of buildings.
b. Consolidated parcels with common access for ingress, egress and parking purposes are strongly encouraged. (See Section V. A., Zoning Regulations)
c. Parking lots adjacent to a street must have a low screening wall, hedgerow or similarly opaque feature of three to four feet in height along the length of the parking lot boundary line facing public right-of-way and a four foot-wide landscaped buffer strip between the parking area and the back of the sidewalk. Acceptable materials for a screening wall include decorative concrete, stone, brick or ornamental ironwork, the wall, hedgerow or other feature may be open in places to allow free movement of pedestrians into, through and out of the parking area. The general overall design of a screening wall should complement the surrounding building architecture.
d. Front yards are not to be removed or used for parking.
5. ADDITIONS TO AND RENOVATIONS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS
a. New additions to existing buildings should be constructed in accordance with these guidelines. Construction of additions should seek to minimize the loss of historic materials on exterior walls. The building finish used for the addition should be similar to the existing structure in the material, quality, color and dimension. If an addition will have too overwhelming an impact upon the architecture and/or the historic qualities of an existing building, visual separation of the addition and the existing structure should be employed to protect the nature of the building.
b. The scale of an addition should be at a scale compatible with the existing building.
c. Damaged or deteriorated significant architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced. If replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced.
d. The architecture of the additions should complement the existing historic character while still remaining a product of their own time period.
e. Reuse of existing residential structures for commercial purposes must not diminish the unique village architectural qualities of the Central Business Zone.
6. TRANSITION AREA
Building design on any lot in the Central Business zone which abuts an adjacent zone should complement the density and design of the Central Business District while providing a smooth transition to the less intense surrounding uses.
119
