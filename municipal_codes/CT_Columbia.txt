(Effective 3/12/2001)
7.5 Reserved for future use
7.6 Rear Lots:
7.6.1 Intent. The intent of this section is to: encourage variation in the development of house
sites; to allow development of parcels that cannot be reached by public streets due to irregular
topography or wetlands; and to minimize the environmental impact of development.
Application of the rear lot provision is not intended to be used to avoid new road construction
where new roads can reach the property, nor to encourage the development of land with
severe limitations for building, septic installation, or other site work required for house
development.
7.6.2 Approval (Revised effective 7/1/14). Subdivision approval is required with the exception
that one rear lot may be created as a first division on any parcel of land that has not been
divided since the Town adopted subdivision regulations on November 20, 1954.
Development of an existing residentially zoned rear lot is by zoning permit.
7.6.3 Location. Rear lots may be approved in Residential and Manufacturing Zones only.
7.6.4 Minimum Lot Area. In residential zones, the minimum lot area is 150,000 s.f. (3.44 acres),
exclusive of access way. The access way shall include all land leading up to the place where
minimum lot width is achieved. In Manufacturing Zones, the minimum lot area is per Section
7.2.
Page 12 of 113
7.6.5 Access Strip. An access strip on which a driveway can be constructed shall be provided for
each lot. The access strip shall be a minimum of 30 feet wide for its entire length. In
residential zones, a vegetated buffer may be required on either side of the driveway in order to
protect the rural, residential character of the adjacent property.
7.6.6 Minimum Square Contiguous Area. In residential zones, minimum lot width is 300 feet and
lot width shall be maintained for a minimum depth of 300 feet.
7.6.7 Yard Requirements. Unless otherwise required in a district, all yard setback requirements
shall be as for rear yards in that district.
7.6.8 Maximum Number of Rear Lots. For the purposes of this section, a "Subject Parcel" shall be
any parcel legally existing as of the enactment of this Regulations Amendment on April 1, 1999.
No more than one lot out of each 6 lots divided from a Subject Parcel may be a rear lot, but the
rear lot may be the first or any subsequent split. When re-subdivisions occur, all lots created
from the Subject Parcel shall be counted in calculating the number of rear lots allowed.
7.6.9 Indemnification. A note shall be placed on the final plan and in the deed to the property
stating: "This lot is served by a private driveway. The Town of Columbia will provide no
maintenance or repair of this driveway, now or in the future.”

set forth elsewhere in these regulations.
8.2 Reserved for future use.
8.3 Accessory Living Unit: One accessory living unit may be added to a single-family house with
approval from the Zoning Enforcement Officer, provided the following conditions are met:
8.3.1 The accessory living unit shall not exceed 30% of the floor area of the primary dwelling unit,
except that primary dwelling units having less than 1150 square feet of floor area may have an
accessory dwelling unit which does not exceed 350 square feet;
8.3.2 No structural alterations are made to detract from the primary dwelling unit's appearance as
a single family dwelling, such as multiple entrances on any one exterior wall, fire escapes on
the road side(s) of the dwelling, and additional driveways to serve the accessory living unit;
8.3.3 The accessory living unit shall include a separate kitchen and bathroom;
8.3.4 The sanitary facilities have been approved in writing by the Town Sanitarian as being
adequate to serve the increased requirements;
8.3.5 Adequate off-street parking is available on the parcel;
8.3.6 An accessory living unit meeting the above conditions may be added to a customary
accessory building, such as a barn or garage, provided that the principle use of the accessory
building remains unchanged, and that no more than one accessory living unit may exist on a
single parcel. (Effective 3/15/95)
8.4 Accessory Uses: Accessory Uses shall not include uses which are otherwise not permitted or
specifically prohibited in the District. In Residence District, accessory uses shall also conform to
the following additional standards and conditions:
8.4.1 The accessory use shall be located on the same lot with the use to which it is accessory.
8.4.2 Accessory Uses may include off-street parking spaces and private garages, but except in
connection with a farm or a SPECIAL PERMIT use, there shall be no more than one (1)
commercial vehicle parked on any lot, and such vehicle shall not exceed 1 ½ tons capacity.
8.4.3 No part of a lot located in any of the Residence District shall be used for access to a use not
permitted in such district.
8.5 Home Occupations: The Town of Columbia recognizes the need for some of its citizens to use their
place of residence for limited activities of a commercial nature. It is the intent and purpose of this
section to establish standards through which limited commercial activities are permitted in the
Town's residential zone through the process described below, while at the same time protecting
the integrity of the underlying residential zone.
8.5.1 A minor home occupation in a dwelling unit located in a residential zone is an additional use
for which a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is required. The application for a Certificate of
Zoning Compliance shall be signed by the person or persons proposing to conduct the home
occupation and shall be accompanied by a detailed description of the proposed use. Each
Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall automatically terminate when the applicant no longer
Page 15 of 113
resides in the dwelling unit. The Zoning Agent can issue such a Certificate if the home
occupation is of commercial nature which does not typically require visitations by clients, does
not result in additional traffic to the site or change the appearance of the property, and if the
home occupation conforms to the following additional standards and conditions:
a. The home occupation is clearly secondary to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.
b. The individual(s) conducting the home business shall reside in the dwelling unit.
c. The home occupation shall be contained wholly within the dwelling or a permitted accessory
building. The total floor area used for the home occupation, whether conducted in the
dwelling or a permitted accessory building, shall not exceed 25% of the total living area of
the dwelling or 750 square feet, whichever is less. However, in no case shall a combination
of home occupation use and related storage for equipment/vehicles exceed 1000 square
feet of building area.
d. There shall be no external evidence of the home occupation so as to change the residential
character of the property, except for a sign as permitted in Section 62.4.1(a).
e. Off street parking, sufficient to the allowed use, is provided.
f. No more than two (2) persons other than members of the household, are employed on the
premises at a given time.
g. The home occupation does not create objectionable noise, odors, smoke, dust, lighting,
vibrations, unsightly conditions noticeable off the premises, television, radio and electrical
and electronic interference, or vehicular traffic in the neighborhood. There shall be no
discharge of a hazardous or toxic substance to the air, surface water, ground water or
ground.
h. One commercial vehicle associated with the home occupation is permitted and it shall be
limited to a single rear axle, single rear wheels vehicle of no more than twenty (20') feet in
overall length (bumper to bumper) and seven (7') feet in overall height. (Road surface to top
of body).
i. One additional commercial vehicle associated with the home occupation is permitted if it
meets the following conditions:
1. The vehicle size is limited to a single rear axle, dual rear wheels vehicle of no more than
twenty-two (22’) feet in overall length (bumper to bumper) and ten (10’) feet in overall
height (road surface to top of body).
2. Said vehicle shall be either garaged on the premises or screened so as not to be visible,
when standing at ground level, form the boundary of any adjacent property including
those properties separated by public or private rights of way. Screening for the purposes

SECTION 10 – NONCONFORMITY – entire section revised effective 9-24-18
10.1 Applicability.
Within the districts established, and amended, by Columbia Zoning Regulations there exist:
? Lots that do not conform to the lot area and/or lot dimension standards for the district in which
they are located,
? Uses of structures that do not conform to the permitted uses of the district in which they are
located, and
? Structures that do not conform to the height, setbacks or lot coverage for the district in which
they are located.
Any nonconforming lot, structure or use that lawfully existed as of the effective date of Columbia’s
Zoning Regulations, as amended, is permitted to continue.
Changes to nonconforming lots, structures or uses, that lawfully existed as of the effective date of
Columbia’s Zoning Regulations, as amended, may be permitted subject to the following regulations.
10.2 Development of a Vacant or Unimproved Nonconforming Lot.
Definition: A vacant or unimproved nonconforming lot is a lot that has been identified in a deed
filed on the Columbia Land Records on or before the effective date of the specific zoning
requirements which made the lot nonconforming for lot area, lot shape and/or frontage for the
district in which it is located, and for which no foundation has been completed in accordance with a
building permit but shall not be deemed a vacant or unimproved lot if any structures on such lot are
subsequently demolished.
A vacant or unimproved lot created by a subdivision or resubdivision is permitted to conform to the
setbacks and lot coverage that were required under regulations in effect when the lot was created,
per Connecticut State Statutes Section 8-26a.
Any other vacant or unimproved nonconforming lot may be developed with a structure for a use
that is permitted in the district in which it is located if approved for subsurface sewage disposal
and private water supplies and the development meets all other requirements of these
Regulations. An application for a variance of yard requirements or lot coverage may be submitted
to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
10.3 Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use of structures or land lawfully existing at the time of
adoption of these regulations (as amended) may be continued as a nonconforming use subject to
the following:
10.3.1 Change of Use.
a. A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use subject to the approval process
of the Columbia Zoning Regulations.
b. Any change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use requires approval
by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The reduction of a nonconforming use to a less offensive
prohibited use that is a more conforming use and more compatible with the character of the
neighboring properties may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a
Page 29 of 113
determination that the proposed change of use will not adversely affect the character or
property values of neighboring properties or adversely affect the general health, welfare or
safety of the Town per section 52.6 of these Regulations.
c. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a more conforming use, the use cannot be changed
to a less conforming use.
10.3.2 Alterations to a building or structure containing a nonconforming use.
a. May be repaired or reconstructed as made necessary by wear and tear, or altered as
required by law or ordinance or such as may be required for safety.
b. May be restored if damaged by fire, explosion, accident, force majeure, act of nature, or act
of a public enemy. Such restoration and repair shall not enlarge, extend or increase the
volume of the structure. Repair shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of the date of
such damage, and completed within twenty-four (24) months, of the date of such damage.
The Planning & Zoning Commission may, upon written application made by the owner of the
lot, extend the time period for initiation and/or completion for one or more additional oneyear
period.
c. The Zoning Board of Appeals may approve a Special Permit Application for alteration or
expansion of the structure if the Board determines that the proposed alteration of the
structure or the expanded nonconforming use will not adversely affect the character or
property values of neighboring properties or adversely affect the general health, welfare or
safety of the Town per Section 52.6 of these Regulations.
10.3.3 Discontinuance or Abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be deemed terminated if:
a. Such use has been discontinued for more than one year, and
b. Upon a finding by the Planning & Zoning Commission, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the
Connecticut General Statutes, that it was the intent of the property owner to abandon such
use.
10.4 Nonconforming Structures on Conforming or Nonconforming Lots. Any structure lawfully existing
at the time of adoption of these regulations (as amended) that does not meet requirements of the
current regulations is permitted to continue.
10.4.1 Nonconforming Structure. A nonconforming structure may be repaired, restored, rebuilt or
replaced provided such repair, restoration, rebuilding or replacement:
a. Does not extend or expand the previously existing nonconformity except as may be
specifically provided elsewhere in these regulations;
b. If due to destruction or damage, shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of the date of
such destruction or damage; and shall be completed within twenty-four (24) months of the
date of such destruction or damage. The Planning & Zoning Commission may, upon written
application made by the owner of the lot to the Planning & Zoning Commission, extend the
time period for initiation and/or completion for one or more additional one-year periods.

21.4 Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Overlay Zones on the Residential Agricultural District:
Zoning Regulations For Zoning Compliance For New Zoning/Building Permits *(effective
10/15/2003)
21.4.1 Intent and Purpose
It is the intent of this section to promote the health and general welfare of the
community by preventing the nutrient enrichment or contamination of Columbia Lake to
ensure a present and future high quality lake resource for a variety of valuable
functional uses including recreation and habitat. The Lake Protection Areas are
designated as overlay zones on the Residential Agricultural or RA District.
The purpose of this section is to facilitate the adequate provision of clean water by
prohibiting, within the Lake Protection Areas, land uses which can contaminate water
resources and by regulating other land uses which may have the potential to
contaminate or down grade existing water resource quality.
The Columbia Lake Ecosystem is a high quality mesotrophic, dimictic lake. The Lake
exhibits mean Summer Transparency greater than 4m; Minimum Transparency
exceeding 3m between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and greater than 1 mg/L of
dissolved oxygen to a depth exceeding 6m at all times. Columbia Lake is capable of
supplying habitat to an array of desirable wildlife species, water-based recreational
activities, and influences the value of real property and quality of life in the Town of
Columbia. Its protection is critical.
Columbia Lake is highly susceptible to increased enrichment with nutrients, particularly
phosphorus, because of its mesotrophic productivity state, morphometry, and
hydrologic relationships. Preventing eutrophication is critical to maintaining the
functional value of Columbia Lake. Columbia Lake is primarily supplied with water from
precipitation that runs off from land surfaces within the watershed. The three Lake
Protection Sub-Areas indicate immediate areas which drain directly to Columbia Lake,
areas which drain through more extensive flow paths to tributary streams, and more
remote areas which first drain to a large wooded swamp (providing natural renovation
capacity for runoff water quality).
21.4.2 Applicability
These regulations shall be in addition to the requirements for the underlying RA District
as designated on the Zoning Map of the Town of Columbia. Both the requirements of
the Zoning Regulations as set forth in other sections and the requirements contained
herein for the Columbia Lake Protection Areas shall apply within such zone. In the event
of a conflict, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
21.4.3 Columbia Lake Protection Area Overlay Zone Maps
The Lake Protection Areas are hereby established on those lands serving as the
immediate (LAR), intermediate (LBR), and remote (LCR) watershed areas to Columbia
Lake. The Lake Protection Areas are delineated on a map entitled: "Columbia Lake
Protection Areas" and is overlaid on the Columbia Connecticut Zoning Map dated
Page 35 of 113
effective 09/30/2003 or as amended. scale 1" = 3500’ prepared for The Town of
Columbia by staff and consultants and approved by action of the Columbia Planning and
Zoning Commission in the regular meeting of 09/09/2003.
21.4.4 Columbia Lake Protection Area Overlay Zone Requirements
All new activities governed by the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Columbia within
the Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Overlay Zones LAR, LBR, and LCR
superimposed on top of the Columbia Residential Agricultural or RA District and which
require a Planning and Zoning, Inland Wetlands, Zoning Boards of Appeals, or Zoning
Compliance Certificate shall meet the following specific requirements for the protection
of Columbia Lake water quality or for stabilization of adjacent and town-wide property
values.
21.4.4.a Nutrient Allocation Compliance
Prior to approval of zoning compliance on a building permit application, the projected
annual export of total phosphorus in pounds per acre per year in estimated stormwater
from the subject parcel shall be computed both for the parcel with existing
improvements thereon and for the existing parcel based on the completed project for
which the building permit is sought. These computations shall be made in accordance
with the methods defined in “Columbia Lake Watershed Management Plan” (hereafter
called the Management Plan) approved 1998, or as may be amended from time to time
based on newer information including but not limited to basic scientific understanding of
nutrient dynamics, infiltration rates of various soils or ground covers and proximal
monitoring data from Columbia Lake. Data for computing the nutrient export estimate,
as defined in the Management Plan shall be provided by the applicant on the site plans,
or similar documentation if site plans are not required by underlying zone requirements
for a building permit application.
If the computed annual export of total phosphorus for the existing parcel with the
completed project for which the building permit is sought is less than the allocation
defined in the Management Plan (total phosphorus in pounds per acre per year for the
Lake Watershed Overlay Zone in which the residential agricultural parcel is located,
namely LAR, LBR, or LCR) the application shall be deemed “in compliance” with Overlay
Zone Requirements and consideration of the application for compliance with any other
requirement of the underlying residential agricultural district may proceed.
If the computed annual export of total phosphorus for the existing parcel with the
completed project for which the building permit is sought is greater than the allocation
defined in the Management Plan, the applicant shall apply adequate best management
practices (BMPs) singly or in combination to reduce the total phosphorus export either to
comply with the allocation requirements of the overlay zone in which the parcel is
located on the Zoning Map or to produce a computed annual export of total phosphorus
at least 10% less than the computed annual export of total phosphorus from the subject
parcel with existing improvements thereon on the date of the permit application. For
these purposes, total phosphorus export shall be recomputed with credits assigned for
BMPs where infiltration coefficients are available and as defined in the Management
Plan.
Page 36 of 113
A worksheet provided as part of the building permit application materials will include
spaces for all required input variables, levels of total phosphorus to be achieved, and
suggested infiltration or other coefficients as available for nutrient allocation calculation.
The applicant will fill in this worksheet and annotate these input numbers to details of a
site plan included in the building permit application package. With the applicant supplied
information, the Agent (ZEO) will input this applicant data into a computer spreadsheet
analysis to estimate the levels of total phosphorus (lb/acre/year) in surface storm water
coming off the specific site or land parcel. The worksheet shall be based on the latest
revision of a nutrient allocation model and level of total phosphorus permissible in each
of the Columbia Lake Watershed Overlay Zones on the Residential Agricultural District,
LAR, LBR, and LCR.
21.4.4 b Best Management Practices for Reduction of Phosphorus
The applicant who is designing or redesigning a project application site plan may use a
number of manuals or texts to find examples or diagrams of what are the current Best
Management Practices or BMPs. The Connecticut Storm water Quality Manual (draft
2003 or as amended) and the Connecticut Erosion and Sedimentation Guidelines (2002 or
as amended) contain some examples, explanations, and diagrams for BMPs that might
be available and appropriate to include in the building permit application site plan.
Generally, applicants for building permits can reduce total phosphorus in storm water by
increasing the storm water infiltration and the detention of storm water before it reaches
Columbia Lake. To the greatest extent possible, BMP’s shall be located between the
development area (or area of greatest impact) and the lake.
The most valuable and practical BMPs are included but not limited to those in the
following list:
O Permeable pavement choices
O Bio-retention structures/residential rain gardens
O Vegetated swales, buffers, filter strips
O Drywells for roof drains/leaching trenches
O Rainwater harvesting
O Dry detention ponds
O Underground detention facilities
O Vegetative filter strips/level spreaders
O Grassed drainage swales, wet or dry
O Proper location and reduction of impervious area on site
O Maintain or restore pre-development vegetation by type
O Encourage sheet flow versus channelization of storm water
O Disconnect flows from multiple impervious surfaces
O Minimize creation of steep slopes/vice versa
O Replanting with trees, underbrush, groundcovers, flowerbeds
Infiltration coefficients to calculate credits for the site plan worksheet may or may not be
available for the above list of BMPS. The most current list of infiltration coefficients
Page 37 of 113
available in the scientific literature will be available on the worksheet page of the building
permit application.
For impervious surfaces greater than 100 s.f., the first 1” flush of storm water shall be
treated with a BMP as identified in Sec. 21.4.4.b of these regulations, the nutrient
allocation worksheet or other methods not listed but approved by staff.
All BMPs shall be maintained and kept in working condition by the owner. If the BMPs
have not been adequately maintained, then no further zoning permits shall be issued
until the BMPs have been brought back to working condition.
21.4.4.c Provision and Procedures for Reduction of Lake Watershed Protection
Requirements
In a case where a proposed activity governed by Section 21.4.4 is unable to comply with
Section 21.4.4a, the Commission may receive and evaluate a written request, site plan,
other relevant materials, and verbal testimony to consider reduction of the
requirements of Section 21.4.4.a. Reduction may only be granted by the Commission as
an action during a regular meeting after a public hearing conducted as if Section 52.4
were applicable and after the finding that the following requirements have been
satisfied: 1.) the annual export of total phosphorus for the subject parcel with existing
improvements thereon on the date of the application shall not be exceeded after
completion of the project for which a building permit is sought; 2.) a so-called first flush
infiltration system either has been employed to the maximum extent possible or is not
possible; and 3.) other reasonably available BMPs have been satisfactorily employed.
If a reduction is granted and a letter from the Commission describing the reasons for the
action granting the reduction is obtained and attached to the building permit
application, the applicant can proceed to demonstrate compliance with all other
applicable regulations required in the underlying Residential Agricultural or RA District.
21.4.4.d Possible Waivers Upon Demonstration Parcel Not Within Columbia Lake Watershed
In a case where the proposed activity governed by Section 21.4.4 appears upon site
inspection by the Zoning Enforcement Officer to be located on a land parcel whose
storm water does not flow in the direction of Columbia Lake, the Commission may
consider information such as topography of the parcel and direction of storm water
either overland or in road drainage system and may authorize the Chairman and the ZEO
to issue a letter to file which would waiver this parcel or portion of a parcel from the
requirements of Section 21.4.
21.4.5 Additional (Non-Regulatory but Suggested) Columbia Lake Protection Actions Not in the
Purview of the Commission.
In addition to the requirement of compliance with the Nutrient Allocation of property
within the designated Columbia Lake Protection Overlay Zone, residents are encouraged
to take additional voluntary actions to protect the quality of Columbia Lake as described
in the Management Plan, including but not limited to:
Page 38 of 113
? Proper maintenance and pump-out frequency of on-site wastewater disposal
systems (septic systems),
? Consider installation of septic tank effluent filters when service is performed,
? Use of sand fill materials with a phosphorus attenuation capacity exceeding 0.01
kg P / cubic ft when constructing or repairing septic system leaching fields,
? Design leaching field geometry to maximize down-gradient soil contact volume
and avoid intersecting septic groundwater plumes,
? Avoid the use of septic system additives,
? Maximize phosphorus removal from wastewater by approved innovative
designs,
? Only use fertilizers that have low, or no phosphorus content made available at
local vendors. *(effective October 15, 2003)

above the base flood elevation.
53.2.2 Non-Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential
structures shall be constructed in accordance with residential construction
standards above, or may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that
together will all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below
the base flood elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall review and or develop structural design,
specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for
meeting the provision of this subsection.
53.2.3 Elevated Buildings: New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings
that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below
the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed
to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
(A) Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
(1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding:
(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above

(4) Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this
ordinance.
53.5 Definitions:
1. Base Flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.
2. Flood Hazard District is defined as and includes all special flood hazard areas designated
as Zone A, A1-30 in the Town of Columbia, Connecticut Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM) and the Flood Boundary and Floodway maps, dated Sept. 16, 1982 and on file
with the Zoning Officer. These maps as well as the accompanying Town of Columbia
Flood Insurance Study are incorporated herein by Reference.
3. Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
4. Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement.)
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s
lowest floor.
Page 78 of 113
5. Mean Sea Level means for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
6. Start of Construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual
start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a
manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of
the piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
7. Substantial Improvements means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration,
or improvements to a structure, taking place during the life of a structure in which the
cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure. The
market value of the structure shall be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to
the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of
the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purpose of this definition,
“substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include any project for improvement of the structure required to comply with existing
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe
living conditions.
8. Water Surface Elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGBD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

SECTION 54 - CLUSTER DESIGN
54.1 Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a method for development of land; to permit
a variety of lot sizes for one-family detached residences in the residential district without an
increase in the density of population of development; to provide for the protection of
surrounding properties, persons, and neighborhood values; to provide for future park and
recreation areas; to ensure proper surface preservation and protection of existing trees,
ground cover, topsoil, rock outcroppings, and scenic historical sites; and to prevent damage
caused by excessive and poorly planned grading for streets and building sites.
54.2 Requirements: Upon application of the owner of the land or his duly authorized agent, the
Commission may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards
prescribed by it, grant a special permit for cluster development of single-family detached
residences in RA-1 and RA-2 districts subject to the following conditions.
54.2.1The tract shall be at least 25 acres.
54.2.2 The tract shall be in a single ownership or consolidated into a single tract by a number
of different owners by means of a binding agreement which will ensure the uniform
treatment and implementation of an overall cluster zone plan for the entire tract from
the time of application and continuing thereafter.
54.2.3 The area, location and bulk standards specified in Section 7 shall not be reduced by
more than twenty (20%) percent.
54.2.4 The total number of proposed residences shall not exceed the number which would be
developed using a minimum lot size of 60,000 square feet.
54.2.5 A plan shall be presented for the entire tract in compliance with the Standards for
Subdivision Development and any and all other applicable ordinances, regulations, and
requirements of the Town of Columbia including, but not limited to the showing of the
location of all existing and proposed buildings, the slopes, grades, and contours of the
tract, the natural features intended to be preserved, areas to be set aside for
conservation, park, or other recreation areas, and improvements thereto, and a
landscaping plan for the entire development of all of the aforementioned including the
elevation of buildings.
54.2.6 The proposed layout shall be in accordance with the Plan of Development for the
Town.
54.2.7 The area proposed to be developed under the cluster zoning regulations shall be
served by community water supply and sewage systems. However, individual septic
tanks and water supply systems may be used if evidence is submitted to the
satisfaction of Health Officer of the Town of Columbia and the Commission that
individual septic tank and water supply systems can function satisfactorily.
54.2.8 All utilities shall be placed underground unless this requirement is waived by the
Commission.
54.2.9 The balance of the land not contained in the building lots shall be of such condition,
location, size and shape as to be readily usable for conservation, park or recreational
purposes. Further, this land shall be strategically located with respect to the lots to be
served and accessible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic from a public right-of-way at
Page 80 of 113
least twenty feet wide. This land shall consist of not less than twenty percent of the
total net acreage; net acreage being defined as the area of the tract excluding the land
area required to be set aside for new public streets.
54.2.10 The balance of the land not contained in the building lots shall, at the discretion of the
Commission, be:
(a) held in such type of legal entity as the Commission may deem appropriate. The
developer shall submit a suitable legal instrument which, to the satisfaction of the
Commission will assure that such land will continue to be used for the conservation,
park, or recreational purposes in perpetuity. Such developer shall also provide for the
adequate maintenance of such area set aside for conservation, park or recreation. The
developer shall also make provision for saving the Town of Columbia harmless from
any legal liability of any nature whatsoever including, but not limited to accident or
occurrence. Such developer shall also provide for the insertion in all deeds, in a form
approved by the Commission, any and all safeguards and conditions in these
Regulations. Such legal instruments shall also provide that the Town of Columbia, its
agents, servants, and employees may, without liability, enter upon such land held for
conservation, park, or recreation and remove or cause to be removed any thing or
object which may be deemed to be a nuisance or in the nature of a nuisance. Such
legal instrument shall also contain a provision that no structure may be erected on said
conservation, park, or recreation land except that which is approved by the
Commission. The legal instrument shall also contain a provision that such area set
aside for conservation, park, or recreation shall always remain and be under the
supervision of the Commission and no change shall be made in the use thereof without
first having obtained approval from the Commission. Owners of land contiguous to
the cluster development may be included and become part of such legal entity owning
the conservation, park, and recreation area, provided that approval from the
Commission and approval by the owners of the legal entity owning the conservation,
park, and recreation area, provided that approval from the Commission and approval
by the owners of the legal entity owning such land has been obtained; or
(b) Deeded to the Town.
(c) Assurance shall be given to the Town of Columbia in a manner satisfactory to the
Commission that the developer of the proposed cluster development shall begin
operations within twelve months and continue thereafter until finally completed and
approved.
(d) A bond shall be posed to cover the costs of development and to insure compliance
with such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe under the terms of
these regulations and as provided in the Subdivision Regulations of the Town, as
amended.

inches in height.
2. Other signs with electronically changeable lettering or images may be permitted by the
Commission after finding that the brightness, colors, location, size and distance from a
public street or residential area are compatible with the character of the
neighborhood. In approving the application, the Commission may place conditions on
the size, height, illumination, timing, transition speed, or other manner of operation.
62.4.7 Sign Area Measurement.
Wall signs: the sign area shall be measured by drawing a single imaginary polygon around

the letters, logos and symbols. Sign area shall include adjacent background material if
such material is designed to be an integral part of the sign because of its texture, color,
graphics or material.
Free-standing signs: the sign area measurement shall be the area between the supports
unless such supports are obviously designed to be advertising; the sign area
measurement shall exclude up to two (2) square feet used for the street address of the
property, and the second side of a double-faced (back to back, or vee-backed) sign,
provided that both sides are equal in area.
62.4.8 Height Measurement of a Free-Standing Sign. The height shall be measured from the
average finished grade five feet (5‘) from the sign support pylon or posts to the highest
part of the sign or supporting structure including finials, decorative cornices and other
decorations, numbers or lights associated with the sign. The grade cannot be altered by
filling, berming, excavating or other means for the purpose of altering the height of the
sign.
62.4.9 Maximum Total Sign Area Calculation in a Non-residential District.
Table 62.6 sets a maximum area for individual wall signs and individual free-standing
signs, and a total of all wall or free-standing signs based on each unique site. The
maximum total square footage for all free-standing signs on one lot or pad site is based
on the street frontage of the primary entry drive. The maximum total square footage for
all wall signs on one lot or pad site is determined by the length of the building facade
with the primary customer entrance door.

SECTION 66 - OUTDOOR STORAGE CONTAINERS
66.1 Intent. The intent of this section is to recognize the need for outdoor storage for
residential and business purposes by allowing outdoor storage containers as limited
below in order to reduce the impact on neighborhood character and property values.
66.2 All outdoor storage containers, if located for more than thirty (30) days, require a
Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
66.3 Temporary outdoor storage containers may be permitted in any district in accordance
with the requirements of Section 8.14 and shall be of a temporary nature for a period of
one year, but which can be renewed once for a total period of not more than two years.
The storage container or containers shall not exceed an aggregate total volume of 84
cubic yards.
66.4 Permanent outdoor storage containers may be permitted as an accessory to permitted
commercial and industrial uses on the lot provided that such containers shall conform to
all of the setback requirements for buildings and other structures. Permanent outdoor
storage containers shall not be located on any lot unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer,
after receipt and review of an application for Zoning Compliance and any additional
documentation or information that he/she shall deem necessary, has determined that the
permanent outdoor storage containers will not create a negative impact on the
neighborhood character in such a way as to present an unsightly appearance when
viewed from adjacent roads or properties. For example, it is preferable that storage
containers be kept in the rear or side yard and screened by landscaping or fencing in a
manner which is in harmony with the principal structure and the neighborhood. The
number of outdoor storage containers shall not be limited but individual storage
containers cannot exceed a total volume of 84 cubic yards each.

6. CHAPTER 6. STREET, HIGHWAY AND OTHER PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
6.1 General Requirements The following improvements shall be required in all subdivisions except where waived in accordance with the regulations of the Open Spaces section of this document, by a specific resolution of the Commission: curbs, storm sewers and pavement on proposed streets, as well as curb and pavement between edge of the existing pavement and the new curb line on existing streets which bound or intersect the proposed subdivision. The applicant shall also be required to install street signs, monuments, and loam and seeding. The Commission may require the installation of fire ponds, dry hydrants, street lighting, sidewalks and shade trees. Materials and construction methods for all improvements shall conform to state standards as described in Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges and Incidental Construction Connecticut Department of Transportation, Form 814, 1988, or latest revision. All designs for storm water runoff management systems shall conform to the standards as described in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines For Erosion and Sedimentation Control, or latest revision. The Rules and Regulations of the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, dated January 1, 1966, with all revisions, shall apply to all technical work done in conjunction with subdivisions. The technical responsibilities of the Registered Professional Engineer and Land Surveyor in regard to subdivision work are: (a) The design of roads, both horizontal and vertical alignment; drainage systems, including the design and location of structures and pipe; sanitary sewer systems; sewage disposal systems; and water supply and distribution constitute professional engineering and as such shall be sealed by a Registered Professional Engineer. A land surveyor’s seal or an architect’s seal is not acceptable for this phase of land subdivision design work. (b) The phase of land subdivision which relates to topography maps and the delineation of the boundary lines of the outside perimeter as well as the interior lots and streets constitutes land surveying within the meaning of the statute and as such shall be sealed by a registered land surveyor. A professional engineer’s seal or an architect’s seal is not acceptable. 6.2 Streets and Highways Proposed streets and highways shall conform to the following specifications: (a) Proposed roads shall be in harmony with existing and proposed thoroughfares shown within the Town’s plan of development, including proposed realignments, and their layout and design shall be approved in each case by the Commission.
(b) The layout of the streets shall be designed whenever possible to discourage permanent dead-end streets in favor of closed loops which are more compatible with the town’s rural atmosphere, enhance the circulation of traffic and facilitate road maintenance. Taking into account the total acreage of the tract and its topography, the Commission may disapprove a layout calling for permanent dead-end streets.
(c) Straight street segments: layout of streets shall be designed to avoid long straight segments that encourage speeding or detract from the general appearance of the subdivision. After consideration of the projected traffic load, the topography and other site conditions, the commission may disapprove a street layout showing straight segments exceeding eight hundred feet (800’) in length.
(d) The applicant, should as far as practical, consider street alignments along an east-west axis to encourage the development of buildings facing true south. (e) Street Arrangement. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the coordination of principal streets of adjoining subdivisions, and for proper projection of principal streets into adjoining properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic, and the construction or extension, either present or when later required, of needed utilities and public services such as drainage facilities. The Commission may waive, in accordance with Chapter 12, or modify this requirement, if the topography or other conditions make such continuance impracticable. To the maximum feasible extent, proposed streets shall be designed in harmony with existing topography so as to minimize cuts, fills, and other disturbance of the natural landscape, and whenever possible, follow a gentle curving alignment with the terrain. (f) New Streets. Where the subdivision adjoins un-subdivided land susceptible to being subdivided, the Commission may require new streets to be carried to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision on such terms the Commission or Town may require.
(g) Reserved Rights-of-Way. When required by the Commission, the applicant shall dedicate to the Town reserved rights-of-way for future street connections to adjoining property susceptible of being subdivided. Such reserved rights-of-way shall be included in an agreement by and between the Town and the developer, and shall include slope rights at least fifteen feet (15’) outside of the street right-of- way. Wider slope rights shall be provided as needed to completely contain all grading areas for the street. Lots adjoining these rights-of-way shall be so laid out that access to the house or garage shall not be over the reserved right-of-way. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the developer of said adjoining property shall be required to connect to and build the street over the reserved right-of-way at his/her own expense.
(h) Construction Standards. Road construction standards shall be as described in Plates 1, 2 and 3 of this Chapter, depending on the designation of the road.
(i) Street Widths. Minimum widths for various street designations shall be as shown in the following table:
Designation
Street Width (Right of Way)
Traveled Width
Arterial Road
80 feet
40 feet*
Major Collector Street (See Plate 1)
50 feet
30 feet*
Minor Collector Street (See Plate 2)
50 feet
26 feet*
Local Street (See Plate 3)
50 feet
24 feet*
*Wherever the preceding street designations are used in these Regulations, the designation for each existing street shall be as set forth in the Plan of Development. The Commission, after evaluating the following factors, will determine the designation for each new street: (1) The type of land use permitted in the subject zone, and/or proposed for the subdivision, such as, residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional. (2) The residential density and/or development intensity of any permitted and/or proposed land uses. (3) The number of acres or residential units or non- residential buildings to be served, both immediately and in the future, including potential extensions of existing or proposed streets. (4) The physical characteristics of the property through which the street is proposed, such as topography, surface geology, water table, and the like. (5) The recommendations of the Plan of Development.
(j) The Commission shall have the discretion to allow a reduction of pavement width to twenty-two feet (22’).
(k) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street that does not comply with the specified width requirements, the applicant shall dedicate the necessary area to the Town for street widening and show such widening on the Subdivision Plan.
(l) Block Dimensions. The maximum length of a block shall be one thousand two hundred feet (1,200’) and the minimum length shall be two hundred feet (200’).
(m)Cul-de-sac Streets: All cul-de-sac Streets: Cul-de-sac streets shall be equipped with a turn-around which has a minimum right-of-way radius and a minimum pavement radius of one-and-one-half times the minimum width for streets of that classification, but in no event less than a right of way radius of sixty feet (60’) and a minimum pavement radius of forty-five feet (45’).
Cul-de-sac Streets. Where a permanent cul-de-sac street is included in a subdivision, it shall not serve more than fifteen (15) residences.
Where the cul-de-sac adjoins un-subdivided land susceptible to being subdivided, the Commission may require the cul-de-sac to be carried to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision on such terms the Commission or Town may require. When there is a possibility of extension of a street, all portions of the cul-de-sac, including pavement, grass strip and sidewalk (if any) that fall outside of the limits of the normal right-of-way width shall occupy the space by virtue of a temporary easement conveyed to the Town before acceptance of the street. The developer extending a street from a cul-de-sac shall be required to remove the existing pavement outside of the standard traveled way, loam and seed said area in which pavement has been removed and install curbs in the original cul-de-sac area in accordance with Town requirements and at his/her own expense. The temporary easement described in the preceding paragraph shall provide for its automatic release upon acceptance of the street extension by the Board of Selectmen. (n) Loop Streets. Loop streets shall not originate at another loop street or a cul-de-sac street. Loop streets shall not provide access to more than twenty (20) lots. No lot within the loop shall have its rear line fronting on the street, unless waived by the Commission, in accordance with Chapter 12. (o) Half Streets. Half Streets shall be prohibited. (p) Side Slopes. Streets in cut or fill shall be provided with slopes not steeper than two feet (2’) horizontal to one foot (1’) vertical, or the permanence of the street grade shall be otherwise provided to the satisfaction of the Commission. In all areas where the side slopes are steeper than four feet (4’) horizontal to one foot (1’)vertical and slope down from the street, metal or pressure- treated wood beam guide rails, at the Commission’s option, shall be installed in accordance with the recommendations of the Town Engineer.
When new streets abut private property, the developer shall obtain necessary slope rights when in cut or fill, and these slope rights shall be shown on the plans submitted to the Commission. The developer shall investigate the effect of fills on adjacent private property within the slope rights area. The developer shall provide the Commission with evidence that no drainage problems or other problems will arise on adjacent property due to construction or fill operations. (q) Relation to Topography. The streets in a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical relation to the topography and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of the street. Streets shall be designed to maximize the preservation of natural and historic features, except as approved by the Commission; examples include specimen trees, large isolated trees, stone walls/fences, historic markers, hedges, and the like. (r) Intersections: Number of Streets Intersecting. No more than two (2) streets shall intersect or meet at any one point and the centerline of all streets entering an intersection shall pass through a single point. (s) Angle of Intersection. Except where impracticable because of topography or other conditions, all streets shall join each other so that for a distance of at least one hundred feet (100’) the street is at approximately right angles to the street it joins. (t) Grades of Intersection. Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed five percent (5%) for a distance of not less than one hundred feet (100’) from the center line of said intersection. (u) Corner Radii. Intersecting local streets shall have a minimum radius of fifteen feet (15’) at the street line. Intersections of local streets with arterial streets and commercial streets shall have minimum radius of twenty feet (20’) at the street line. All other intersections shall have a minimum radius of twenty-five feet (25’) at the street lines. (v) Distance Between Intersections. Intersections shall be spaced a minimum of two hundred feet (200’) apart measured from the points of intersection of the centerlines. Two streets intersecting opposite sides of a third street are to have the same point of intersection or else their center lines are to be separated by a minimum of two hundred feet (200’) on a third street. (w) State Road Intersection. The Subdivision Plan shall be submitted to the State Department of Transportation if a proposed street in the subdivision intersects with a State Highway. State Department of Transportation conditional approval shall be given in writing before the Commission gives subdivision approval (x) Sight Lines. For a distance of fifty feet (50’) from the point of two (2) intersection property lines nearest to the street intersection, all planting, screening and grades shall be so designed and maintained as to assure adequate visibility for approaching pedestrian and vehicular traffic. This sight line shall be shown on the map and secured by a permanent easement in favor of the Town. (y) Street Signs. Street name signs shall be erected at points designated by the Town and
shall be shown on the Subdivision Plan. They shall be installed in accordance with state standards and at the expense of the applicant. Each entrance to a subdivision may be marked by a single sign that meets with the standards of the zoning regulations of the town of Columbia. Any further entrance treatment, including gates, walls, fences or flagpoles require the approval of the commission which shall approve only those installations that are compatible with the character of the town and as per the town of Columbia’s Plan of Development. (z) Street Names. Road names shall he accepted by the planning commission and should bear a meaningful relationship to the history, geography, character, natural features or landmarks of the vicinity or of the town. Road names should not closely replicate any existing road name in Columbia or vicinity so as to cause confusion of addresses.
(aa) Street Lights. Streetlights shall be installed at all intersections and at the end of cul-de-sacs, unless specifically waived by the Commission. Where power is overhead (i.e., intersections with existing roads), a luminaire which conforms to the type used on comparable streets by the franchised electric company for the area shall be mounted off an existing pole; where power is underground, the applicant shall submit the type of luminaire and pole to be installed for review and approval by the Commission. The Commission may require that a decorative luminaire shall be used, as provided by the franchised electric company for comparable rural residential areas. All new light poles shall be located a minimum of four feet (4’) from the curb. (bb) Grades. The minimum grade of all streets shall be one percent (1%). Maximum grades shall be as follows, with the lower limit being the desirable maximum grade and the upper limit being the absolute maximum grade. The Commission shall determine the allowable maximum grade for any particular installation.

(dd) Existing Street Improvements.
(1) Whenever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing Town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width and construction set forth in these Regulations, and the Commission determines that approval of the Subdivision Plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision, the Commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street by and at the expense of the applicant, or may disapprove such plan until the Board of Selectman has authorized expenditures for such improvements. (2) Frontage Improvements. Whenever any subdivision is proposed for land which fronts on an existing Town street which does not conform with the minimum requirements of width and construction set forth in these Regulations, the applicant shall improve such frontage from the center line of the street to the required street line, in accordance with the appropriate Plate 1, 2 or 3 of this Chapter. Where such improvement from the centerline is impractical, the Commission may require improvements of comparable value to be performed along the existing road frontage of the subdivision, or adjacent frontage impacted by the subdivision. In the alternative, the Commission may require that the cost of such improvements shall be paid to the Board of Selectman, or its designated agent, in lieu of the completion of such improvements by the applicant. Such payment shall be held in a separate fund to be used exclusively for the improvement of the subject street in ways that directly benefit the future owners of lots in the subdivision.
In making the above determination, the Commission shall take into account the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely, the drainage conditions of the street, and generally the ability of any vehicle to use the street safely.
(ee) Utilities. All utility lines, including but not limited to, those required for electrical, communication, and cable television sources and related facilities, shall be placed underground within the street right- of-way, or adjacent right-of ways, and shall be shown on the Subdivision Plan. The applicant shall make all necessary arrangements with the service utility to provide the underground services. The methods of installation shall be approved by the particular utility company and be in conformance with these Regulations. The Commission may waive all or part of these requirements, in accordance with Chapter 12, if extreme circumstances such as topography or other conditions warrant. (ff) Watercourses. Where a major watercourse separates an existing street from abutting property to be subdivided, provisions shall be made for carrying such watercourse by means of culverts or other structures. (gg) Drainage. All curtain and cellar drains may be tied into the storm water drainage system, where required or approved by the Town Engineer. Catch basins are to be made of all pre-cast parts (e.g., sumps, reducers, and curb tops with grates). Manholes or center-placed catch basins are not to be used for storm drainage unless approved by the Town Engineer. Flared end section pipes shall be used at all culvert outlets or inlets, unless the Town Engineer approves headwalls. (hh) Street Bound Monuments. Street bound monuments, composed of concrete or granite at least four inches (4”) square at the top and at least three feet (3’) long and containing a ferrous rod, shall be placed at all block corners, at angle points, and the points of curves in streets and at such intermediate points as may be necessary. The location of all street monuments shall he indicated on the Final Subdivision Plan. They shall be installed and their accuracy certified by a registered land surveyor. (ii) Inspections During Construction. In the case of a new street or a change in an existing street, the Commission may require that the work be inspected by a registered civil engineer of its choosing at the following stages of construction. (a) At completion of rough grading. (b) After drainage and all other underground facilities are installed, and prior to back fillings. (c) During graveling and rolling and prior to placement of base material. (d) Prior to application of binder course. (e) Prior to application of top course.
The developer shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to the first stage until the Commission or its appointed agent has made such inspections, on the preceding stage, and approval in writing has been obtained for such stage. The developer shall give 72 hours notice, minimally, to the Commission or its appointed agent for each inspection. (jj) Dedication of Streets. Approval of a Subdivision Plan shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance of any street by the Town. However, the filing of an approved Plan shall constitute an irrevocable offer of dedication by the owner of the land to the Town.
6.3 Storm water Runoff Management Systems An applicant for any subdivision involving one or more of the following criteria shall submit a hydrologic review and summary to the Commission: 1. The development will involve the destruction or removal of vegetation or other ground cover and the exposure of soil materials on five (5) acres or more. 2. The subdivision will involve the grading or filling of five (5) acres or more of land. 3. The proposed impervious portion of the total subdivision area is 25% or greater. 4. The Commission finds that a hydrologic review and summary is necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare of the Town. (a) Nature of Review. The methods used to estimate peak flows and runoff volumes shall be in accordance with those described in the 2004 Connecticut Storm Water Quality Manual, as they may be amended. The peak discharges from the two (2)-year, ten(10)-year, twenty-five (25)-year and one-hundred (100)-year frequency, 24-hour duration type III distribution storms before and after development and downstream impacts shall be analyzed. The report and analysis submitted to the Commission shall consist of a narrative, summary table and supporting calculations. (b) Results of Review. If the Commission determines that downstream areas may be adversely affected by increased peak discharges or if peak discharges are increased for the two (2)-year storm, the ten (10)-year storm, or the one-hundred (100)-year storm, then the Commission shall require the applicant to submit a proposal for a storm water management system. (c) Elements of a Storm Water Management System. The following standards shall be met in any storm water management system submitted to the Commission: 1. Except as provided below, no increase in peak flow from the analyzed storms shall be allowed unless an analysis of downstream areas shows that increases are acceptable considering:
(i) The timing of peak flows from sub-watersheds, (ii) The increased duration of high flow rates, (iii)The stability of the downstream channels, (iv)Flood routing (the distance downstream that peak discharges are increased), and (v) Existing land use and zoning. Detention basins, parking lot storage, underground tanks or other effective methods may accomplish prevention of peak flow increases. 2. Design of detention basins shall be in accordance with the Detention Basin (DB) measure contained in the 2004 Connecticut Storm Water Quality Manual, as may be amended. 3. Design of infiltration trenches, parking lot storage, and underground tanks shall be in accordance with the Runoff Management System Standard contained in the Soil Conservation Service Technical Guide Section IV (SCS Standard #570). 4. Inlets to a detention basin must be provided to allow entrance of flood flows in excess of the maximum capacity of the storm sewer pipe system. 5. Maximum infiltration to the groundwater is encouraged except in areas where the potential exists for contamination of an aquifer with polluted surface water. Design of the storm water management system shall consider reducing runoff by use of such techniques as minimizing impervious areas and maximizing travel times by using grass or rock-lined channels in lieu of storm sewers. 6. When the Commission determines that engineering, aesthetics, and economic factors make combined detention or other drainage facilities more practical for construction by the Town, the Town shall require a fee or equivalent dedication of land which shall be used to construct joint facilities. The Commission may permit several developers to construct joint facilities. 7. Runoff management system components shall be designed according to sound engineering principles and installed in a sequence that permits each to function as intended without causing a hazard. Single components shall not be installed until plans for the entire runoff management system are completed and approved. The Commission shall approve final discharge points. 8. If on-site facilities are not to be dedicated to the Town the owners shall properly maintain them so that they do not become nuisances. The owner, or others responsible for the system, to ensure that each component functions properly, shall prepare a plan of operation and maintenance for use. This plan shall provide requirements for inspection, operation, and maintenance of individual components, including outlets. It shall be prepared before the system is
installed and shall specify who is responsible for maintenance. Adequate rights-of-way must be provided for maintenance access. If a privately owned facility is not maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Town shall take whatever measures are necessary to insure proper maintenance, at the expense of the owner. 9. All runoff control structures located on private property, whether dedicated to the Town or not, shall be accessible at all times for Town inspection. Where runoff control structures have been, or are intended to be, accepted by the Town for maintenance, access easements shall be provided.
10. Appropriate safety features and devices shall be installed to protect humans and animals from such accidents as falling or drowning. Temporary fencing can be used until barrier planting is established. Such protective measures as guardrails and fences shall be used on spillways and impoundments as needed. 11. Runoff management systems should be visually compatible with the surrounding landscape.
12. Permits for runoff management systems may also be required from the Columbia Inland Wetlands Commission, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and/or other regulatory agencies. The applicant is responsible for securing these permits before Commission approval can be granted.
13. The Commission may submit copies of the proposed storm water management plan to the Tolland County Soil and Water Conservation District for review and comment.
14. Storm sewers shall have a minimum pitch of one-half percent (0.5%) and a maximum pitch of ten percent (10%). Variance from this requirement may be granted by the Commission if storm sewers are designed with a minimum self-cleaning velocity of three feet (3’) per second with full flowing pipes. 15. A minimum cover of two and one-half feet (2 1/2’) shall be provided for all storm drains. 16. No storm drain system shall outlet onto adjoining properties without a drainage easement; nor into a natural watercourse, whether continually flowing or intermittent, so as to exceed the capacity of the watercourse, or to cause erosion, sedimentation, scouring, or other adverse impacts on such watercourse. 17. The first inlet in a storm drain system shall be located within three hundred feet (300’) of the roadway high point. A drainage structure, either an inlet or a manhole, shall be provided at three hundred foot (300’) maximum intervals on all storm drains with the exception of the first inlet. A drainage structure shall also be
placed at each grade change along a storm drain, at each change in horizontal direction, and at each junction point of two (2) or more drains. 18. Under drain outlets shall be connected to drainage structures whenever practical. When impractical, they shall be terminated with an approved end wall or flared end pipe. At all under drain outlets, a “free outlet” condition should be provided. 19. The minimum pipe size for all public storm drain systems constructed under these Regulations shall be fifteen inches (15”) inside except that culverts of a lesser size may be permitted where recommended by the Town Engineer. 20. The following types of pipes shall be used for drainage installations: i. Reinforced concrete pipes or High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe or equivalent for surface drainage storm sewer systems and cross culverts. ii. Where clearance is limited by utilities, pipe arches or oval pipe may be used. iii. On grades over ten percent (10 %), Corrugated HDPE or equivalent shall be used. 21. Drainage easements shall include a ten foot (10’) access strip in addition to the width of the channel or brook from bank top to bank top. Channels shall be rip rap stone or paved when deemed necessary by the Commission. 22. Drainage easements, outside of street lines, shall be at least thirty feet (30’) wide and shall include wording so as to allow inclusion of other utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. Easements for outlet pipes shall extend to a suitable existing storm drain, an adequate natural watercourse or a suitable infiltration system per Paragraph 5 of this Section. The centerline of storm sewer is not to be installed less than ten feet (10’) from the edge of the right-of-way. 23. Where the development streets join existing Town streets, the developer must provide drainage at intersections as necessary, or as directed by the Commission 24. The size and location of all private storm drains that connect to the town storm drain system shall be approved by the Commission prior to installation. A waiver, in a form approved by the Town Attorney, must be filed by the applicant with the Commission. The waiver shall relieve the Town of any responsibility for damage resulting from any failure of the private storm drainage system. This waiver shall be in the chain of title and shall run with the title to the property as to subsequent purchasers. 25. Details of special or unusual drainage structures shall be submitted to the Commission for review and approval before construction.
26. Where any proposed lot or lots has its required frontage on an existing Town street, and has an existing ditch or waterway along the front of said lot or lots, but within the Town right-of-way, the applicant, at his expense, shall install a storm water pipe drain, of suitable size and material, necessary catch basins and a curb, to conform with the curb line.
6.4 Drainage Design Criteria Selection of the appropriate method of calculating runoff shall be based upon the size of the drainage area and the type of output, as described in the Connecticut Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines, (2002), as may be amended. The following additional criteria shall be used in the design: (a) All storm drainage facilities shall be designed based on the following storm return frequency criteria: Residential Drainage Systems: Storm Sewers and Minor Ditches; 10-year storm. Commercial Districts: All Drainage Facilities; 250-year storm. Industrial Parks: All Drainage Facilities; 25-year storm. (b) Rainfall intensities used for storm drainage shall be taken from Plate 4 of this Chapter
(c) Design discharges for major channels and brooks may, with the concurrence of the Commission, be based on a flood hydrograph or flood flow formula type of analysis. (d) Off-site drainage and the ultimate development of adjoining land shall be addressed and calculations provided in the design of a storm drainage system for the subject site. All off-site impacts, alterations, easements, and similar information shall be shown on the subdivision plans. 6.5 Subdivision Street Work Prior to Acceptance Prior to Town acceptance of new subdivision streets, all catch basins and detention basins are to be cleaned and all roadways swept. The applicant shall be responsible for any and all maintenance required on unaccepted subdivision streets, including snow removal.
7. CHAPTER 7. GUARANTEE OF PERFORMANCE
7.1 Insurance (a) Prior to the endorsement of the Final Subdivision Plan in accordance with these regulations, the applicant shall file with the Commission, on a form provided by the Town, a general liability insurance policy. This policy shall be of the same term as the Performance Bond and shall be extended in conformance with any extension of the Performance Bond. (b) The policy shall insure the Town of Columbia and its agents, and the applicant and shall cover all his operations in the development involving existence and maintenance of property and buildings and contracting operations of every nature including all public Improvements. Said policy shall have the following limits:
General Liability Insurance
Bodily Injury
Each Person
Not Less Than $1,000,000
Each Accident
Not Less Than $3,000,000
Property Damage
Each Accident
Not Less Than $1,000,000
Note 1 – A policy providing a combined single limit of liability applying to both bodily injury and property damage of not less than $3,000,000 may be substituted for the limits shown above.
Note 2 – A separate liability policy and an Umbrella Liability Policy with equivalent limits is also acceptable.
7.2 Performance Bonds (a) Construction Bond. A construction bond shall be posted by the applicant prior to the endorsement of the Final Subdivision Plan, and prior to the commencement of construction of any improvement or work on any lot to insure the completion of required improvements and utilities in the event the applicant shall fail to install same within two (2) years from the date of the bond. The Commission, upon approval of a petition, may extend the term of the construction bond from the developer requesting an extension to the Commission (subject to agreement of such extension by the surety).
In computing the amount of the bond, the Commission shall include the construction cost of the following items: 1. The construction cost of all required improvements, including storm drainage system, erosion and sedimentation control measures, roads and pavements, sidewalks and curbs, trees, grading setting of monuments, and any other requirements made as a condition for subdivision approval or depicted on the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan, Plan and Profile, Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan, or any other plan as approved by the Commission. 2. Estimated costs shall be those that would allow for the Town advertising, awarding a contract, and paying for construction of the Improvements. 3. Costs shall be projected to a point at the end of the construction bond term. Any extension of the term of the construction bond may result in an adjustment to the bond total. 4. The total estimated cost of the construction bond shall also include a fifteen percent (15%) addition to cover contingencies and engineering. 5. Where a subdivision is to be developed in phases, the applicant may petition the Commission in writing for permission to post a construction bond covering the costs itemized above, related to those Improvements and utilities located within or required to serve one or more phases rather than for the entire development. The applicant prior to commencing development of any or all additional phases shall obtain similar permission. Where the applicant bonds in phases as authorized in this paragraph, no Improvement, as that term is defined in these Regulations, shall be commenced in any phase for which no bond has been posted. (b) Maintenance Bond. Of the bond amount described in the preceding Section, the Town, following acceptance of the improvements as a maintenance bond, shall retain ten (10%) percent. The maintenance bond shall be in the form of cash or Letter of Credit that complies with the following section. The maintenance bond will insure the maintenance and adequacy of the constructed public streets, utilities, services and other Improvements for a period of one (1) year after acceptance by the Town. 7.3 Form of Construction Bond As used in these Regulations, the term “construction bond” or “bonded” or “bond” or similar terms shall refer to one of the following methods of assuring completion of Subdivision improvements: (a) Cash in the form of a certified check; or a passbook, assigned to the Town by assignment forms prescribed by the Commission’s legal counsel. The issuing bank (“surety”) shall be one maintaining offices in Hartford, Tolland, or Windham Counties. (b) A letter of credit in favor of the Town in the form prescribed by the Commission’s
legal counsel. Only a bank having a worthiness rating of “investment grade” or better and maintaining offices in the State of Connecticut shall issue such letter of credit. The issuing bank (“surety”) shall be one maintaining offices in Hartford, Tolland, or Windham Counties. The above-referenced forms shall be acceptable by the Town and shall be the only ones acceptable to the Commission. The amount of the bond shall be the sum that the Commission shall require. The completion date of all required Improvements shall be as required by the Commission, but, in no event, longer than the period set forth in Chapter 126 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 7.4 Duration and Release of Bond Release of such construction bond shall be contingent upon completion of all public Improvements within the term of such bond or any extension thereof. The commission, upon approval of a petition, may extend the term of construction and the associated bond from the developer requesting an extension. The Commission may consider allowing the sum of the construction bond to be reduced from time to time. Each reduction shall be subject to concurrence of the Board of Selectmen. Before such reduction is allowed, the Commission must receive a report from a Connecticut licensed professional engineer, of its choosing, stating that all or some portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the approved subdivision plans and these Regulations. Application for the release of the construction bond shall include the submission of scale ‘as-built’ drawings that will include all changes in the plans as authorized by the Commission during the course of construction. However, if the Commission has agreed to release the bond in phases, ‘as-built’ drawings, as described above, are only required at the final phase of construction bond release. As-built drawings shall be signed and sealed by a land surveyor licensed in the State of Connecticut. If such construction bond and/or maintenance bond is a cash bond, all accrued interest shall be held and released to the applicant only at the release of the bond. Upon final completion of the Improvements, in accordance with these Regulations and the approved Plan, and within the prescribed time limit of the portion of any road covered by such construction bond, the Commission shall release the bond and return any collateral. If such construction, at any phase, is not in accordance with such specification or if such portion of such road is not duly and finally completed within such time limit, the Commission may recommend that the Town utilize the bond for the completion of construction. If at any time, the bond required by this section shall not be in effect for incomplete or unaccepted Improvements, the Commission may file a caveat on the Land Records warning potential purchasers of such fact; or may void the subdivision in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 12 of these Regulations.
7.5 Certificate of Zoning Compliance Before any Certificate of Zoning Compliance (Zoning Permit) is issued for the construction of any building in such subdivision on a lot which fronts on a subdivision road which has not been accepted by the Town as a public road, the applicant shall complete such road to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer, in accordance with the specifications up to the farther side line of such lot, to a stage in construction at which only final surfacing of the road remains to be done before completion of the road. The foregoing shall not apply to street trees, sidewalks, or other types of road-related Improvements not required for vehicular travel, but shall apply to the installation of street name signs to facilitate the provision of emergency services. The balance of the work on such road, and all other public Improvements shall be bonded in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. In addition, water and effluent disposal, be it by individual on-site systems or community systems, shall be operational and accepted by the appropriate Town or State agencies prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance allowing the occupancy of the dwelling on any lot. 7.6 Agreement for Installation of Improvements For any subdivision involving the installation of Improvements, the applicant shall, prior to the endorsement of the Final Plans, enter into a written agreement with the Town to perform such Improvements, which agreement shall be in a form specified by the Commission.
8. CHAPTER 8. LOT AND DRIVEWAY DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
8.1 Lots In general, all lots within the proposed subdivision shall conform to the following specifications. 8.1.1 All Land To Be In Lots Land owned by the applicant and located adjacent to the proposed subdivision shall not be withheld if it is not capable of satisfactory independent subdivision into lots of the size specified, nor there any fragment of a lot in the subdivision area of less size than specified for lot dimensions. Fragments must be incorporated into full size lots. 8.1.2 No Unapproved Lots No lot, regardless of size, which is rendered useless for building due to utility easements, right-of-way, watercourses, or topography, or which has not been demonstrated to comply with these Regulations and the Columbia Zoning Regulations, shall be shown as a building lot on any subdivision. Such property shall be included in adjoining lots. 8.1.3 Side Lines Sidelines of lots shall, insofar as practicable, be either at right angles or radial to street lines. Variations from this section will be made only where it is impractical to do otherwise. 8.1.4 Parking and Turnaround Space shall be provided on all lots for off-street parking for a least two vehicles, and provision shall be made for vehicular turn-around. 8.1.5 On-Site Sewer and Water All lots shall have adequate area for on-site water and sewerage systems. 8.1.6 Zoning Compliance All lots shall meet the minimum area and shape requirements as specified in the Town of Columbia Zoning Regulations. 8.1.7 Lot Boundary Markers A lot boundary marker shall be placed by the applicant’s surveyor on each lot corner and also at any point where a change in angle or curve of a lot line occurs. Such marker may be a steel rod, iron pin or other equally permanent material. The permanent marker location shall be shown on the subdivision map and must be placed on the site prior to the signing of the mylars. The Commission may waive this requirement on extremely large lots or remaining tracts of property.
8.1.8 Driveways Driveways shall be designed and constructed to promote traffic safety and to prevent or
minimize drainage problems. All subdivision proposals shall show driveway locations with associated grading, tree and brush removal, drainage improvements, sightlines, and other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of these regulations. The following standards shall apply:
(a) Compliance with all Applicable Requirements. Driveways shall conform to applicable Town Ordinances, Zoning Regulations and to Department of Transportation requirements on State roads.
(b) Distance to Intersection. Driveway cuts shall be located a minimum of seventy-five feet (75’) from any roadway intersection.
9. CHAPTER 9. OPEN SPACES AND RECREATION AREAS
9.1 Open Space Requirements
The Commission shall encourage the preservation of open space by requiring a dedication of fifteen percent (15%) of each subdivision of land over ten (10) acres as open space to be set aside by an applicant for the purposes of conserving natural or scenic resources; protecting natural streams, marshes, ponds and aquifers, supplementing existing open space (including recreational) areas; meeting recreational needs of present and projected populations in the area; protecting historical and archaeological sites, wildlife sanctuaries, distinct habitat and outstanding forests; preserving ridges, ravines, ledge outcroppings, and other unusual physical features; and promoting orderly community development.
The Commission shall approve the selection of the open space portion offered by the applicant of any subdivision. In its acceptance, the Commission shall consider any open space proposal made by the applicant and also any expert opinions presented by the state, regional, or town agencies and organizations as to the suitability of a proposed open space parcel for designation as open space. Such selection shall be based on a determination by the Commission that the parcel or parcels of land selected as open space are suited to the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development or its most current amendments or updates and the uses enumerated herein.
9.2 Dedication
The Commission shall have the right to accept at least fifteen percent (15%) of the property to be subdivided to be dedicated as open space, park, or playground land. Open space, park or recreation areas larger than the specified fifteen percent (15%) may be proposed by an applicant for acceptance by the Commission.
9.3 Land Designation
In evaluating a potential open space dedication, the Commission shall have the right to consider all land within the property to be subdivided, and with the applicant’s consent, any other nearby tract owned, controlled or optioned by the applicant. Subject to the criteria established in this regulation, the commission shall consider all applicant-proposed locations for open space, park or playground dedications.
1. Where required, the land so dedicated shall be designed as an integral part of the subdivision and shall be chosen on the basis of its value in providing open space, park or playground benefits to the future occupants of the proposed subdivision and its value in regard to the following factors:
a. Protecting and conserving natural and man-made features and or scenic view and vistas;
b. Promoting the Plan of Conservation and Development;
c. Enhancing living conditions and protecting cultural and historic features;
d. Creating recreational opportunity;
e. Providing greenbelts and trails connecting parks and separated open space parcels and providing flexibility for potential open space, park or playground extensions onto adjacent properties;
f. Protecting endangered and threatened species, State species of special concern, significant natural communities, and important wildlife corridors.
2. In accordance with the dedication options cited in Section 9.9., and in accordance with the other provisions of this regulation, all subdivisions involving more than ten (10) acres shall submit, as part of the subdivision plan, the following:
a. A proposal for the location of land to be dedicated for open space, park or playground use, which considers the criteria of Section 9.3.1.
b. The method(s) of dedication, and
c. Any proposed improvements for the dedicated land.
For subdivisions of multiple sections or re-subdivisions, the subdivision area and number of the lots shall be calculated on a cumulative basis.
9.4 Final Determination
In all instances, final determination regarding the need of open space, park or playground land and the location, extend and use of open space, park and the appropriate methods of dedication shall be the responsibility of the Commission. Where required, each dedication shall be based on the criteria established in this regulation and shall be of a suitable size, location, topography and general character to serve the particular purposes deemed proper by the Commission.
9.5 Exemptions
In accordance with the provisions of Section 8-25a of the Connecticut General Statutes, the voluntary open space requirements of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in Section 8-39a of the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty percent or more of the total housing units to be constructed in such subdivision. However, all applicants are encouraged to consider dedications for open space, park or playground purposes. The lots receiving the above family waiver may not be sold to non-family members within the first five years.
9.6 Referrals
For all subdivisions involving ten (10) acres, or more, the Commission shall refer the subdivision proposal to the Board of Selectman, Conservation Commission, Open Space Committee, Inland Wetlands Commission and any other agency or
organization the Commission deems may have an interest. Referrals are mandatory whenever an applicant proposes the payment or fee in lieu of dedication cited in Section 9.10. All referral comments shall be considered with respect to the proposed subdivision plan, site and neighborhood characteristics and the standards and objectives cited in this regulation. Referral comments should consider:
a. The significance of the natural agricultural, cultural and historic features and resources of the site, the adequacy of their protection in the proposed plan and specific recommendations or measures or changes in the plan to effect their conservation and protection:
b. The most appropriate method of open space, park or playground dedication, taking into account the subdivision characteristics and the objectives cited in Section 9.7.
c. The size of the subject subdivision and the need (existing or anticipated) for active recreational facilities in the area of the site.
d. The most appropriate location and extent of open space to be preserved and the locations of any recommended conservation easements.
9.7 Character of Land to be Dedicated Where an open space, park or playground dedication is made, the land to be dedicated may include wetlands or watercourses as defined in the Connecticut General Statutes, and slopes over twenty percent (20%), but the Commission has the right to require that the percentage of the dedicated land within these wetland, watercourse and steep slope categories are not greater than the percentage of wetlands, watercourses, and slopes over twenty percent (20%) within the property to be subdivided and as applicable, within previous subdivision sections where dedications were not made.
For example, consider a one-hundred (100) acre tract to be subdivided with, cumulatively, forty (40) acres of wetlands, watercourses and slopes over twenty percent (20%) (forty percent (40%) of land to be subdivided) and sixty (60) acres of land without these limitations (sixty percent (60%) of land to be subdivided). The Commission shall have the right to require fifteen (15) acres of open space, park or playground land (.15 times 100), of which at least nine (9) acres (.6 times 15) does not include wetlands, watercourses or slopes over twenty percent (20%).
9.8 Location of Land to be Dedicated
In evaluating a potential open space dedication, the Commission shall have the right to all land within the property to be subdivided and with the applicant’s consent any other adjacent tract owned, controlled or under agreement to buy or optioned by the applicant or by a corporation controlled or owned by the sub- divider. Subject to the criteria established in this regulation, all applicant
proposed locations for open space, park or playground dedications shall be considered by the Commission.
9.9 Methods for Open Space Dedication
As noted in Section 9.7., final determination of the appropriate method(s) of meeting open space, park or playground dedication requirements shall be the responsibility of the Commission and shall be based on the criteria established in this regulation. The applicant may employ one of the following mechanisms, as deemed proper by the Commission:
a. Dedication of land to the Town of Columbia;
b. Dedication of land to the State of Connecticut as State Park and forestland;
c. Dedication of land to private conservation trust or land trust;
d. Provision of a conservation easement with full, limited, or prohibited public access;
e. Provision of private open space, such as land held in common by an association of homeowners;
f. Any other mechanism considered protecting the purposes to be served by setting aside open space land.
The Commission may establish such standards, limitations and conditions on use of any of the above mechanisms, as it deems reasonably necessary to assure the proper maintenance, operation and preservation of open space, and, where appropriate, public access.
The following dedication methods are discussed for consideration:
a. Dedication to the Town of Columbia - In considering dedication to the Town of Columbia, the number of subdivision lots and the size, location, topography and general character of the site shall be evaluated with respect to potential benefits to the future residents of the proposed subdivision and with respect to potential benefits to the future residents of the proposed subdivision and with respect to municipal goals and objectives. In many cases, open space objectives will be suitably addressed through dedication methods other than municipal ownership. Subject to the comments of the Board of Selectman and other referral reports, dedication to the Town shall be most appropriate whenever one or more of the following criteria are met:
1. The land to be subdivided has Town-wide open space, historic or environmental significance or existing hiking trails or recreational attributes that would best be protected through municipal ownership;
2. The land to be subdivided is adjacent to existing municipal open space, parks, or playgrounds;
3. Where Plan of Conservation and Development or other open space or recreational goals or objectives would best be promoted through municipal ownership.
Unless otherwise indicated by the Commission, land to be dedicated to the Town shall be labeled on the final Subdivision Plan as “Land to be dedicated to the Town of Columbia for open space, park or playground purposes.”
b. Dedication Through Conservation Easement - The Commission shall have the right to accept from the applicant/owner open space through the establishment of conservation easements. Conservation easements, which restrict the use of the land but do not transfer ownership, can be utilized to address open space, agricultural, historic and environmental protection objectives where a transfer of ownership is not necessary or appropriate to achieve land use goals. Conservation easements may provide for public access, but in most cases where public access is deemed appropriate, ownership by a governmental agency or private conservation organization should be considered. All conservation easements shall be shown on the subdivision plans. Draft easement documents, prepared in accordance with Town guidelines, shall be submitted for review in accordance with other provisions of these regulations.
1. Procedures for the establishment of conservation easements shall be reviewed against the draft or samples as represented in these regulations for general conformity to equivalent goals and objectives.
2. Procedures for the monitoring and enforcement of easements shall be reviewed against the draft or samples as represented in these regulations for general conformity to equivalent goals and objectives.
c. Dedication through Other Governmental Agencies, Land Trusts, or Other Conservation Organizations - The Commission, upon the request of the applicant, may allow open space, park or playground dedication requirements to be met through the transferal of land to other government agencies, land trusts, or other conservation organizations. In cases where these methods are considered, the recipient agency shall indicate its interest in receiving the subject land and the actual transferal shall take place prior to or concurrent with the filing of the subdivision maps on the Land Records, unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Commission. The subject transferal shall be shown on the final subdivision plan.
d. Dedication through Homeowners Associations or Common Interest Ownership Community - The Commission, upon the request of the applicant, may allow open space, park or playground dedication requirements to be met through the transferal of land to an association of property owners. Such a transferal shall be in accordance with guidelines established by the Commission and shall include provision which:
1. Establish mandatory participation in an association of property owners to maintain the land reservation for established open space, park or playground purposes, with power to assess all members for all necessary costs;
2. Shall be binding on all future property owners;
3. Shall ensure adequate maintenance and liability protection;
4. Shall provide for the potential dissolution of the association by a vote of all members (at a minimum, a majority vote of all members shall be required for dissolution). Upon dissolution of the association, the open space dedication shall revert to the Town, which may take action through the Board of Selectmen to retain or dispose of said open space conservation easement. Where Town ownership is not retained, the land shall be subject to a conservation easement and shall be used only for purposes consistent with provisions of such easement.
After verification by the Commission and Town Attorney that the provisions of Section 9 have been incorporated, the legal documents establishing the Homeowners Association shall be filed by the applicant on the Land Records prior to or concurrent with the filing of the subdivision maps on the Land Records, unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Commission. The subject transferal shall be shown on the final Subdivision Plan.
9.10 Payment in Lieu of Dedication
After receipt of referral reports, the Commission may authorize all or part of the open space, park or playground dedication requirements to be met through a payment in lieu of dedication. This payment in lieu of dedication option shall be considered only where the Commission does not consider other dedication options appropriate. In cases where this option is utilized, the provisions of Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes shall be met and the subject payment shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
In lieu of any requirement to provide open spaces, the applicant may propose, and the commission may accept, the payment of a fee and the transfer of land to the town. Any such payment of combination of payment and the fair market value of
the land to be transferred may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided, measured prior to the approval of the subdivision. Payment of fees in lieu of open space shall be paid into a dedicated fund that the Town has created specifically for the purposes of obtaining other open space parcels or purchase of development rights when they may become available at a future time.
9.11 Access Requirements
With the exception of conservation easements without public access or proposed expansions of existing open space, park or recreation areas which currently have adequate access, all open space, park and playground dedications shall extend or have a right-of-way to a street as defined in these regulations. The frontage or right-of-way shall be at least twenty feet (20’) wide and the topography and physical character of the access way shall be suitable for vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic as determined by the Commission. At its discretion, the Commission may have the right to require the applicant to make improvements such as grading, drainage and surfacing along the access way to ensure safe and suitable access by fire, police or other emergency vehicles and the public.
9.12 Site Improvements
a. In addition to the access requirements of Section 9.11, the Commission may have the right to require an applicant to make site improvements such as clearing, grading, drainage, seeding and parking areas where active park, playground or hiking trail uses are deemed appropriate. The referral reports shall be considered in determining whether site improvements are appropriate. The degree of site improvements required shall be directly associated with the number of proposed lots within the subject subdivision. For example, a graded and seeded multi-purpose playground field may be suitable requirement for a larger subdivision of twenty (20) or more lots. In situations where site improvements are required, the site work shall be depicted and fully documented on final subdivision plans and the site work shall be completed or fully bonded to the Commission’s satisfaction before final open space subdivision site plans are signed and filed on the Land Records.
b. With the exception of site work that may be required by the provisions of Sections 9.11 and 9.12, or agricultural activities approved by the Commission, all land dedicated as open space or park land shall be left in its natural state by the applicant and shall not be graded, cleared or used as a repository for stumps, rocks, brush, soil, building materials or debris.
9.13 Monumentation
In all cases where land is dedicated for open space, park, playground use or limited use in conservation easements, the applicant shall be required to place permanent markers on the ground to delineate the boundaries of the land so dedicated. Said markers shall be installed as per the standards cited in Section 9.9 of these regulations. In addition, the Commission shall have the right to require
applicants to place medallions showing Town of Columbia Conservation Land boundaries on stakes more than four feet high or on trees or posts along open space or conservation easement boundaries.
9.14 Legal Requirements
The applicant may propose and the Commission shall determine the form and adequacy of all arrangements for ownership, use and maintenance responsibility for all dedicated open space, park or playground areas and for all conservation easements. All conveyances of rights, title, interest and easements shall be in a form approved by the Town Attorney, shall be accompanied by a Certificate of Title and releases or subordinations of liens and encumbrances where appropriate, and shall be executed and recorded on the Columbia Land Records prior to or concurrent with the filing of the final Subdivision Plan, unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Commission.
9.15 Modifications to Approved Dedication Arrangements
In the event the Board of Selectman decides not to accept land offered as open space for dedication to the Town, or in the event another approved dedication arrangement cannot be finalized, a committee appointed by the Commission shall reanalyze the subject situation and recommend the appropriate manner of fulfilling the open space, park, or recreation requirements of these regulations.
9.16 Review of Preliminary Open Space, Park or Playground Plans
If questions arise regarding the provisions of this open space, park or playground dedication regulation, prospective applicants are encouraged to review their preliminary plans with the Commission’s staff on an informal basis.
9.17 Trail Systems
In any case in which an existing trail system (including a rerouted trail system) crosses land to be subdivided or re-subdivided, the applicant is encouraged to preserve the system as it exists or reroute it to assure continued public access. The area covered by any legally valid easement for such a trail system, which adequately protects continued public access to the trail system shall be considered part of the total open space set aside.
9.18 Natural State Set Aside
Any land to be set aside as open space shall be left in its existing natural state by the applicant, and shall not be graded, cleared or improved, except as specifically approved by the Commission, and shall not be used at any time as a repository for stumps, brush, earth, building materials, or debris.
9.19 Visual Amenities
Open space shall be so located as to add to or to preserve the visual amenities of the vicinity by maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or overlooking it from nearby properties. When open space is set-aside for recreational purposes, it shall be located so as to be suitable for the designated
recreational uses it is intended to serve. All open space and any proposed improvements thereon should be shown on the subdivision or re-subdivision plan.
10. CHAPTER 10. NATURAL FEATURES
10.1 Preservation For the purpose of enhancement of property values and for erosion control, the applicant shall provide for the preservation and enhancement, where possible, of existing natural features, including but not limited to, rare and unusual flora, large trees, scenic points, wetlands, ledge outcroppings, other natural features and stone walls. The Commission may accept compromise to this requirement if the applicant supports the compromise with documented basis. 10.2 Trees, Soil Removal and Roads (a) For the purpose of enhancement of property values and for erosion control, the preservation and protection (to the fullest extent possible) of shade trees and the natural features of the site throughout the subdivision shall be encouraged, except where they interfere with roads and utilities. Removal of trees shall be held to a minimum. (b) Approval of a subdivision by the Commission shall not constitute approval of the removal of soil, topsoil or other excavated material from the premises other than that from the road area, and then only to the depths shown on the approved plan. (c) The land located within a subdivision shall be properly graded and left in a condition that will be free of rubble and debris, and properly stabilized to eliminate erosion. Stumps, logs, construction materials, and other debris shall only be buried on site in locations designated on the approved subdivision plans, and in compliance with all applicable Town and State laws and regulations. (d) Trees of fifteen (15) inches in diameter or larger located within twenty (20) feet of any street right of way shall be preserved and given suitable protection to ensure their survival during the construction phase. Proposed driveways shall be located with the objective of preserving said large trees. Where trees are proposed by the applicant or required by the commission, the applicant shall include the number, layout, species and size of plantings. (e) Any of the new trees enumerated in the item above shall be replaced with new trees equivalent to those originally provided if they die within one year following completion of all subdivision improvements or acceptance of roads, which ever comes later. The applicant shall bear all replacement costs, including removal of dead trees. An allowance for such costs shall be included in the maintenance bond posted for the subdivision.
10.3 Scenic Features The Commission may require that a subdivision plan provide protection for specific features other than through their placement within designated open space. Individual scenic features to be protected in this fashion shall have been determined by the Commission to have natural or historical importance to the town. Such features may
include, but are not limited to, old stonewalls or farm structures, waterfalls, trees or stands of trees and rocky peaks or outcrops.
11. CHAPTER 11 - FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT STANDARDS
11.1 Conformance to Flood Hazard District Regulations Any proposals for subdivisions having land in the Flood Hazard District shall conform to all the provisions of these Regulations, the Columbia Zoning Regulations and the following additional standards:
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have utilities and facilities such as septic, gas, electric and water systems located and constructed in accordance with Columbia’s Flood Hazard District Regulations.
(c) In Zone A, base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals.
12. CHAPTER 12 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
12.1 Gas Pipeline A gas pipeline shall be deemed a hazard when carrying an internal pressure in excess of 200 pounds per square inch and when located within forty (40’) feet of a property line. To lessen such hazards, the applicant shall: (a) Maintain forty foot (40’) building setback lines on both sides of easement. (b) Locate wells, septic tanks and all appurtenances and connections on the same side of the pipeline as the buildings they serve. (c) Locate proposed streets and driveways so that they cross pipe lines at right angles as much as possible. In such street crossings, the pipe shall be in a vented casing the full width of the street right-of-way, and the distance from the top of the casing to the proposed road surface shall be at least four feet six inches (4’6”). 12.2 Temporary Sanitary Facilities If the Commission determines that the scope of the project warrants it, the developer shall be required to provide temporary sanitary facilities on the site. 12.3 Pedestrian Walkways/Bikeways In order to insure the safety of school children and other pedestrians, the Commission may require the installation of graded pedestrian walkways or safe walking paths along the right of way of any arterial or connecting road or along any road that, because of width, curves, grades or traffic volume, represent severe hazard to pedestrians. Such paths shall be installed wherever children are obliged to walk to a school bus stop along roads judged hazardous. A graded pedestrian walk way shall be at least 36 inches in width, be constructed on public easements no less than fifteen feel in width and graded for easy pedestrian use. The walkways may be informal in design; finished in accordance with the specifications to be described in each case by the Commission. The Commission may also require bicycle paths and trails. Locations shall be along the roadside and in other appropriate right-of-way locations where it is determined that there exists such a need for safety. Where required, the applicant, in accordance with specifications for base, width, alignment, wearing surface and safety markings as prescribed in each case by the Commission, shall construct these facilities.
12.4 Enforcement
These Regulations shall be enforced under, and violations hereof shall be subject to, the penalties set forth in the applicable provisions of the Statutes and any ordinance enacted pursuant thereto. The enforcement of these Regulations shall be by the Commission or its designated agent. In addition, in the event that any applicant shall violate these Regulations, or the
conditions or requirements of any subdivision approved hereunder, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator and to the current property owner, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Columbia Land Records. 12.5 Waiver The Commission recognizes that each parcel of property is unique in location, dimensions, orientation, topography and other parameters. And that the various factors in the design of subdivisions are variable with relation to each other and to the above characteristics of the property, Therefore, in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-26, the Commission may modify or waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such requirements as, in its judgment of the special circumstances and conditions, are not requisite to the interest of public health, safety and general welfare. In considering a modification or waiver under this Chapter, the Commission shall only approve such modification or waiver by a ¾ vote of the Commission upon a finding that all of the following conditions are met:
(a) Conditions exist on the subject property that are not generally applicable to other land in the Town or; (b) Said conditions are such that, if these Regulations were strictly applied, natural and historic features could not be preserved, as required by these Regulations or; (c) Said conditions were not created by the property owner or by his/her predecessor(s) in title or; (d) The granting of the modification or waiver would be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these Regulations or; (e) The granting of the modification or waiver would not have a significant adverse impact on adjacent properties values, the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be in violation of the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, as the same may be amended from time to time.
Any request for modification or waiver under this Chapter shall be set forth on the Subdivision Application form, and, if granted, shall be noted on the Final Subdivision Plan with a reference to the lot(s) affected, and the Section of these Regulations modified or waived, and the extent or nature thereof. In granting or denying any request under this Chapter, the Commission shall state upon the record the reasons for such action.
12.6 Separability If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of these Regulations is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion hereof.
12.7 Amendments The Commission; at any meeting called for this purpose after a Public Hearing has been held on the proposed amendment, may amend these Regulations. 12.8 Enacting Clause. Short Title and Repeal The Columbia Planning and Zoning Commission acting under authority of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, hereby adopts and enacts these Regulations as the “Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Columbia”. The provisions of the Subdivision Regulations heretofore in force and any amendments thereof, so far as they are the same as in these Regulations, are to be deemed continued and not as new enactments. Any and all provisions of said Regulations as originally enacted which are inconsistent with the provisions of these Regulations are hereby repealed, but this shall not affect any violations thereof already existing or any penalty incurred and the same may be prosecuted as if these Regulations had not been adopted. 12.9 Effective Date These Regulations shall become effective on October 1, 2008. A copy of these Regulations shall be placed on file in the Office of the Town Clerk.
12.10 Consideration of Alternate Construction Standards The Commission recognizes both the need for flexibility to accommodate individual site conditions and the desirability of using state-of-the-art technology. The Commission will consider and may approve alternative design and construction standards, including minimum width pavement and shoulders of engineered grassy swales in lieu of curbing, if all of the following conditions are met. Such standards are prepared by a professional engineer, currently licensed in the State of Connecticut, with experience in the field of storm water runoff and municipal and highway engineering; and such standards do not conflict with the requirements of other town, state, federal regulatory bodies, unless exception are granted there under; and such standards can be shown to be equal or superior to requirements contained herein; and the commission’s designated reviewing engineer recommends in favor of the use of the alternative standard; and such standards are in accordance with the purpose and intent of these regulations as may be determined by a majority vote of members of the Commission.
13. CHAPTER 13. FIRE FIGHTING WATER SUPPLY
