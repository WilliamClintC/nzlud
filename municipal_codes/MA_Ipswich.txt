§ A405-2 TOWN BYLAWS § A405-2 

§ A405-2. List of Special Acts applicable to Town. 
The Massachusetts General Court has enacted various special laws relating to the Town of Ipswich. Persons using this index should recognize thatreference to the text of each statute as enacted is essential to a completeunderstanding thereof. The notes which accompany the index merely summarize briefly the subject matter of the statutes. Each statute is citedby reference to the "Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts." 
The index begins with the year 1920 simply because an arbitrary decision was made that earlier special enactments would have little or no practicalsignificance for persons interested in determining what is the "governingbody of law" under which the Town operates presently. Note also the adoption, in 1966, of the "Home Rule Amendment," so-called, to the Massachusetts Constitution (Article 89) and to the enactment, at a SpecialSession of the General Court in 1966, of Chapter 734 ("Home Rule Procedures"), which became Chapter 43B of the General Laws. The HomeRule Amendment provides in Section 9 that the General Court shall act inrelation to cities and towns "...only by general laws which apply alike to all cities, or to all towns, or to all cities and towns, or to a class of not fewer than two..." Special laws which apply to particular municipalities areauthorized in only four situations which are specifically defined. Because of the Home Rule Amendment and the enabling legislation enacted pursuantthereto, we conclude that there will be relatively few occasions in thefuture when our State Legislature will enact special statutes for the Town of Ipswich, especially in such narrow terms as some of those hereinafter
reported.  
State Law  Subject Matter  
Chapter 494, Acts of 1911  Providing for an eight-hour day.

I. PURPOSE
This bylaw is enacted for the following purposes: to lessen congestion in the streets; to conserve
health; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic, and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air;
to prevent the over-crowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the
adequate provision of transportation, water, water supply, drainage, sewerage, schools, parks, open
space, and other public requirements; to protect, preserve and maintain the existing surface and
groundwater supplies and their drainage or recharge areas within the known aquifers of the Town; to
encourage efficient use and conservation of energy; to conserve the value of land and buildings
including the conservation of natural resources and the prevention of blight and the pollution of the
environment; to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the town, as guided by the
Ipswich Community Development Plan and the Town Character Statement; and to preserve and
increase its amenities. It is made with reasonable consideration to the outstanding characteristics and
unique position that Ipswich holds in the historical background of the Country and the character of
each district and to its peculiar suitability for particular uses; in accordance with the General Laws of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Chapter 40A, and any amendments thereto. (Amended by 10/17/05
Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 12/12/05) (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 1/23/08)

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
II. APPLICABILITY
A. General
This bylaw and any amendment thereto shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or
lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the
public hearing on this bylaw or amendment, but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of
use, to a building or special permit issued after the first notice of said public hearing, to any
reconstruction, extension or structural change of such structure and to any alteration of a structure
begun after the first notice of said public hearing to provide for its use for a substantially different
purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater
extent except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to a single or two
family residential structure does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure.
B. Nonconforming Uses and Structures
This zoning bylaw shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to
a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on such
bylaw required under G.L. c. 40A, s. 5 at which this zoning bylaw, or any relevant part thereof, was
adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and structures may continue, provided
that no modification of the use or structure is accomplished, unless authorized hereunder.
1. Nonconforming Uses. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a special permit to change or
substantially extend a nonconforming use in accordance with this section only if it determines
that such change or extension shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood
than the existing nonconforming use. The following types of changes to nonconforming uses
may be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals:
a. Substantial extension of the use;
b. Change from one nonconforming use to another, less detrimental nonconforming use.
Pre-existing nonconforming uses may be extended or altered provided that there is a finding by
the Zoning Board of Appeals that the extension or alteration shall not be substantially more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use.
2. Nonconforming Structures Other than Single and Two Family Structures. The Board of Appeals
may grant a special permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or change a nonconforming structure in
accordance with this section if it determines that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or
change shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing
nonconforming structure. The following types of changes to nonconforming structures may be
considered by the Board of Appeals:
a. Reconstructed, extended or structurally changed;
b. Altered to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a
substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent;
The reconstruction, extension or structural change of such nonconforming structure so as to
increase an existing nonconformity, or create a new nonconformity, including the extension of
an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a required yard, shall
require the issuance of a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
3. Nonconforming Single and Two Family Structures. Nonconforming single and two family
residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a
determination by the Inspector of Buildings that such proposed reconstruction, extension,
alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. The following
circumstances shall not be deemed to increase the nonconforming nature of said structure:
a. Alteration to a structure which complies with all current setback, yard, building coverage,
and building height requirements but is located on a lot with insufficient area, where the
alteration will also comply with all of said current requirements.
Page 7
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
b. Alteration to a structure which complies with all current setback, yard, building coverage,
and building height requirements but is located on a lot with insufficient frontage, where the
alteration will also comply with all of said current requirements.
c. Alteration to a structure which encroaches upon one or more required yard or setback areas,
where alteration will comply with all current setback, yard, building coverage and building
height requirements (the provisions of this clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot
complies with current area and frontage requirements).
d. Alteration to the side or face of a structure which encroaches upon a required yard or setback
area, where the alteration will not encroach upon such area to a distance greater than the
existing structure (the provisions of this clause shall apply regardless of whether the lot
complies with current area and frontage requirements).
e. Alteration to a nonconforming structure which will not increase the footprint of the existing
structure provided that existing height restrictions shall not be exceeded.
In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the nonconforming nature of such
structure would be increased by the proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may, by special permit, allow such reconstruction, extension, alteration
or change upon its determination that the proposed modification will not be substantially more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure.
4. Abandonment or Non-use. A nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not
used for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the
provisions of this bylaw.
5. Reconstruction. Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed after a fire, explosion or
other catastrophe, provided that such reconstruction is completed within twenty-four months
after such catastrophe, and provided that structures other than single or two-family dwellings
reconstructed shall be only as great in area as the original nonconforming structure unless a
larger area is authorized by special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals. Such time for
reconstruction may be extended by the Zoning Board of Appeals for good cause, provided that
the extension request is made no later than two years after the catastrophe, and provided that the
extension is for no longer than two years. Reconstruction of single and two family structures
shall be allowed pursuant to Section II.3. and/or Footnote 18 to the Table of Dimensional and
Density Regulations. The time period for reconstruction of structures to which the demolition
delay has been applied by the Ipswich Historical Commission shall be extended by a time period
equivalent to the length of the delay, up to a maximum of twelve (12) months, without requiring
approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals. (Amended by 10/20/08 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/28/09; Amended by 10/17/11 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/2/12)
6. Reversion to Nonconformity. No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use,
revert to a nonconforming use. (Subsection B replaced through 6. in its entirety by 10/16/00 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 3/8/01)
7. Compliance with Other Special Permit Requirements. The granting of a special permit for
expanding or altering nonconforming uses or nonconforming structures other than single and two
family structures as authorized herein does not supersede any other special permit requirements
for such use or structure as indicated in the Table of Use Regulations or elsewhere in this bylaw.
(Added by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04)
Page 8
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
C. Municipal Construction Projects
Municipal construction projects shall comply with all the requirements of this Protective Zoning
Bylaw, as amended, before the Town shall grant a building permit. No variation from the provisions
of this bylaw shall be allowed unless and until the municipality has obtained any and all variances
and/or special permits as may be required in accordance with the provisions set forth elsewhere
herein. All municipal construction projects, including additions to existing public buildings, that
create 2,500 square feet or more of new building area, shall be certifiable under the U.S. Green
Building Councils most current applicable LEED® standards for design and construction, unless the
Board of Selectmen determines that meeting the LEED® standard will be economically infeasible
based on a cost analysis and the projected cost savings, including operations. For the purposes of this
subsection, a municipal construction project means any development project, including demolition,
building, construction, alteration, installation or addition, undertaken by the municipality directly by
or through any agency, authority, department, division, or subset thereof. (Added by 10/20/97 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/10/98) (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)

B. Intent of Districts
The intent of the districts is as follows:
1. The Rural Residence Districts are intended primarily for single-family residential uses in a rural and
semi-rural environment. Agricultural uses are permitted, as are community facilities necessary to
service the residential uses. Generally, commercial and industrial uses are not permitted. The district
is generally not served by municipal sewerage, but areas within the district may be accessible to it.
Municipal water supply is available in most areas of this district.
2. The Intown Residence District is intended primarily for residential uses in the older, more
established area of the Town. The predominantly permitted use is single-family residences, but twofamily
and multi-family residential uses may also be permitted. Community facilities necessary to
service the residential uses are permitted. In addition, certain business uses may be permitted, but
most non-residential uses are not allowed. The district is generally served by municipal water supply
and sewerage facilities.
3. The General Business (GB) District is intended primarily for retail, trade, service, and other
commercial uses with some compatible light industrial uses. Multi-family residential uses may be
permitted. The District is generally served by municipal water supply and sewerage facilities. (Added
by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04)
4. The Central Business (CB) District is intended primarily to accommodate a composite of business
and retail uses, multi-family residential uses, office uses, and institutional uses, all of which
comprise the Towns central core. The district is served by municipal water supply and sewerage
facilities. (Added by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04)
5. The Highway Business District is intended primarily for retail, trade, service, and other commercial
uses; multi-family residential uses at a density defined by this bylaw may also be permitted by
Special Permit. The District is generally served by municipal water supply but is only partially
served by sewerage facilities. (Added by 10/18/93 Special Town Meeting; approved by 2/3/94 by Attorney General)
Page 19
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
6. The Planned Commercial District is intended for non-residential uses. Office and service uses
are generally permitted; retail, research and development, enclosed manufacturing, warehousing
and other commercial uses require a special permit. The district is intended to preserve the
natural features and vistas of the Route One Corridor. The district is not served by municipal
sewerage or water. (Amended by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91) (Amended by
10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
7. The Industrial District is intended for light industrial uses and business uses, which are
compatible with adjacent uses. Industrial uses which might constitute a nuisance due to odor,
fumes, dust, vibration, or other nuisance type characteristics, are not intended. The District,
except that portion bordering Route One, is served by municipal water supply and either served
by municipal sewerage facilities or located in an area of planned sewerage expansion.
8. The Limited Industrial District is intended for light industrial, wholesale, and warehouse and
office uses. Industrial uses which require smelting or chemical reduction or which might
constitute a nuisance due to odor, fumes, dust, vibration, heat, glare, noise, (i.e., have a decibel
level over fifty-five (55) more than fifty (50) feet from the premises), or other nuisance
characteristic are not intended. Retail use is prohibited. The district is intended to preserve the
natural features and vistas of the Route One Corridor. The district is not served by municipal
sewerage. Municipal waste supply is available only in that portion of the district bordering Old
Right Road and the access road to Assessor's Map 27A, Parcel 21. (Amended by 10/22/90 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91) (Amended by 10/27/15 Special Town Meeting)
9. The Water Supply Districts are intended to protect the public health and safety by preserving
and maintaining the existing ground and surface water supplies and to protect the community
from the costs which may be incurred if unsuitable development were to reduce either the
quantity or quality of the municipal water supply.
10. The Flood Plain District is intended to protect persons and property against the hazards of flood
inundation by assuring the continuation of the natural flow pattern of the water courses within
the Town; to minimize the impact of coastal storms; to protect the health and safety of
individuals; and to protect the community from costs which may be incurred from unwise
individual choices of uses of lands which are subject to seasonal or periodic flooding. (Amended by
4/1/85 Annual Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 11/4/85) (Amended by 11/4/91 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 3/5/92)
11. The Wireless Communication Districts are overlay districts intended to accommodate wireless
communication facilities. Wireless Communication District A is intended for all types of
wireless facilities, including free-standing monopoles. Wireless Communication District B is
intended only for wireless facilities wholly enclosed within or attached to buildings or
structures. (Added by 10/21/02 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/03/03)
12. The Green Space Preservation Development District is an overlay district intended to expand
the Towns economic base by allowing limited non-residential uses on certain large properties
in the RRA and RRC Districts. This overlay district preserves the allowed uses of the
underlying districts while allowing specified non-residential uses if designed to protect the
Towns natural features, rural character and vistas, preserve open space, and provide an
alternative to subdivision of large parcels for residences. (Added by 10/20/08 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 1/28/09)

cases the Zoning Board of Appeals may also grant the special permit for noncompliance with
dimensional and density regulations of this bylaw. Suitable guarantee shall be provided to the
Town for the prompt removal after termination of any special permit. Travel or camping trailers

with the use shall be suitably screened from adjoining properties by a solid fence erected in
conformance with footnote 17 to the Table of Dimensional and Density Regulations in Section
VI.B. of this bylaw, and be effectively controlled so as not to provide a nuisance because of
noise, traffic, or other conditions which may become objectionable to the surrounding
neighborhood. (Amended by 10/20/97 STM; approved by AG 2/10/98) (Amended by 10/19/09 STM; approved by AG

during the harvest season of the primary crop raised on land of the owner or lessee, twentyfive
percent (25%) of such products for sale, based on either gross sales dollars or volume,
have been produced by the owner or lessee of the land on which the facility is located, or at
least twenty-five percent (25%) of such products for sale, based on either gross annual sales
or annual volume, have been produced by the owner or lessee of the land on which the
facility is located and at least an additional fifty percent (50%) of such products for sale,
based upon either gross annual sales or annual volume, have been produced on
Massachusetts land used for the primary purpose of commercial agriculture, aquaculture,
silviculture, horticulture, floriculture, or viticulture, whether by the owner or lessee of the
land on which the facility is located or by another, except that all such activities shall be
allowed by right on parcels of less than five (5) acres but no less than two (2) acres in size,
provided that the sale of products produced from the agriculture, aquaculture, silviculture,
horticulture, floriculture or viticulture use on the parcel annually generates at least $1,000
per acre based on gross sales dollars. If the above requirements cannot be satisfied, the use
may be allowed only by special permit of the Zoning Board of Appeals, although in no
instance shall the ZBA approve a use that generates annually less than $1,000 per acre
(based on gross sales dollars) from products grown on the property, and provided that the
ZBA finds that said use meets the general intent of this footnote 7. (Amended by 10/20/08, 10/19/09

of time. These provisions shall not apply to motor vehicles which are designed and used for
farming purposes.
11. Provided that all principal and accessory buildings occupy not more than fifteen percent
(15%) of the lot on which said use is located; outdoor activities associated with the use are
suitably screened from adjoining properties by a solid fence erected in conformance with
footnote 19 below, and are effectively controlled so as not to provide a nuisance because of
noise, traffic or other conditions which may become objectionable to the surrounding
neighborhood; and that there is no more than one (1) nonresident employee nor more than a
total of two (2) instructors engaged in the program. (Amended by 10/20/97 STM; approved by AG 2/10/98)

VI. DIMENSIONAL AND DENSITY REGULATIONS
A. Applicability of Dimensional and Density Regulations
The regulations for each district pertaining to minimum lot area, minimum lot width, minimum lot
frontage, minimum front setback, minimum side setback, minimum rear setback, maximum height of
buildings, maximum number of stories, maximum building area, minimum open space, and other
dimensional controls shall be as specified in this section and subject to the further provisions of this
bylaw. Unless otherwise exempted elsewhere in this bylaw, all structures must comply with
minimum setback distances, even if the structures do not require a building permit. (Amended by 10/17/93
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/94; Amended by 10/17/11 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 2/2/12)
B. Table of Dimensional and Density Regulations
See table on accompanying pages (36-38) plus attached footnotes (pages 39-43), which is declared to
be part of this bylaw.
C. Determination of Lot Areas
The lot, setback areas, or open space required for any new building or use may not include any part
of a lot that is required by any other building or use to comply with any provisions of this bylaw, nor
may those areas include any property of which the ownership has been transferred subsequent to the
effective date of this bylaw, if such property was a part of the area required for compliance with the
dimensional regulations applicable to the lot from which such transfer was made, except that this
provision shall not apply to the part of the lot remaining after a taking or conveyance for a public
purpose. (Amended by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93)
D. Separation of Lots
Lots shall not be separated or transferred in ownership so as not to comply with the provisions of this
bylaw; nevertheless, any lot on which more than one house existed at the time of the adoption of the
Protective Zoning Bylaw may be divided and sold to separate owners and used with the minimum of
non-conformance.
E. Screening Requirements
Screening shall be required in the minimum side and rear setbacks of any new wholesale, transportation,
industrial, commercial or multi-family use in all districts. Screening shall consist of fencing
and/or densely planted vegetation along the entirety of each side and rear lot line. Vegetative
screening shall be at least ten (10) feet in width, except where a use abuts a Rural or Intown
Residence district boundary, in which case it shall be twenty (20) feet along the district boundary.
Low impact development integrated stormwater management practices, such as bioretention cells
and vegetated swales, may be located within the vegetative screening setback areas, provided they
are done so in a manner that does not prevent the screening from meeting the objective of providing
a year-round vegetated buffer between properties. Where a lot is divided by a district boundary, use
of the lot within another district may be used to comply with the rear and side screening
requirements as set forth in this bylaw. Screening shall provide a year-round buffer between
properties and, where plant materials are utilized, shall be species appropriate to the climate and
terrain of the property. (Amended by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91) (Amended by
10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93) (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 2/19/02) (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)
Except in the Limited Industrial District, by special permit, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
approve alternative screening or alternative height, setback, or location thereof, unless the principal
use is subject to special permit approval by the Planning Board, or is subject to site plan review, in
which case said Planning Board may approve by special permit such alternative screening. In
considering an alternative screening, the Zoning Board of Appeals or the Planning Board, as
applicable, may consider approval of such alternative screening or approval of an alternative height,
setback, or location thereof only if the applicant submits to said applicable Board a landscape plan
prepared and stamped by a registered landscape architect. (Amended by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved
by Attorney General 1/14/91) (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
Page 34
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
In the Planned Commercial and Limited Industrial Districts, a landscape and screening plan shall be
provided for the entire site. The landscape plan shall provide for adequate screening as necessary
from the street and abutting lots. Such screening shall consist of densely planted evergreen shrubs,
trees, and/or berms which form an opaque barrier. (Added by 10/22/90 Special TownMeeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)
An existing natural screen on a lot having a non-conforming use (either principal or accessory) shall
not be removed by the owner or occupant without a variance from the Board of Appeals.
F. Requirements for Accessory Buildings and Structures
An accessory building or structure may be located in accordance with the Table of Dimensional and
Density Regulations (Accessory Buildings and Structures) and footnote 2 to said table. Accessory
buildings and structures shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or use provided that
not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of a minimum lot area shall be so occupied and, further,
that an accessory building or structure shall not be located less than five (5) feet from the principal
building. Accessory buildings and structures are prohibited from having attached decks or porches or
other similar structures unless the accessory building or structure is used for habitation, and provided
that the deck or porch or other similar structure is no more than sixty-four (64) square feet in size and
open to the sky. Except for buildings and structures used for agricultural purposes as defined by
M.G. L., C.40A, s.3, accessory buildings and structures greater than seven hundred and fifty (750)
square feet in area or more than twenty-five (25) feet in height, and located on lots less than five
acres in size in the residential districts, shall be allowed only by special permit from the Zoning
Board of Appeals, and only upon a finding that:
1. The proposed accessory structure satisfies the criteria for Special Permit as prescribed in
Section XI.J.2., paragraphs a. and b. of this bylaw; and
2. The proposed accessory structure does not create a substantially greater burden for the Town
or neighborhood than would an accessory structure under seven hundred and fifty (750)
square feet in area or under twenty-five (25) feet in height. Considerations include:
a. Whether the traffic generation and/or parking needs associated with the proposed
accessory structure would be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood;
b. Whether the proposed accessory structure requires extension or alteration of existing
utilities that would otherwise be adequate for a smaller accessory structure;
c. Whether the large size of the proposed accessory structure necessitates design,
construction, or other physical features out of character for the district that could be
avoided with a smaller accessory structure; and
d. Whether the design of the proposed accessory structure, in terms of materials,
proportions, height, architectural details and scale, is adequate to ensure that the large
accessory structure preserves the character of the surrounding area and is compatible
with the architectural design style of the principal building on the site; and
e. Whether the proposed accessory structure produces or exacerbates any other impact
that the SPGA deems a detriment to public health, safety, and welfare which could be
avoided with a smaller accessory structure; and
3. The principal use to which the proposed structure will be accessory is permitted in the
zoning district as a matter of right, as prescribed in Section V.D. TABLE OF USE
REGULATIONS and the lot and principal structure conforms to all dimensional and density
regulations of Section VI. of this zoning bylaw. Accessory structures that are tent-like, made
of canvas or similar materials, and greater than 120 square feet in area, shall be allowed only
by special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals except for those structures that are for
temporary purposes only. (Amended by 10/17/92 STM; approved by AG 1/11/93) (Amended by 10/15/01 STM; approved
by AG 2/19/02) (Amended by 10/18/04 STM; approved by AG 1/27/05) (Amended by 10/17/05 STM; approved by AG 12/12/05)

and/or maintained between a height of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the street grade at
the centerline, within the area formed by the intersection of the street lines and a straight line
joining said street lines at points which are twenty (20) feet distant from the point of intersection
of ways or tangents of curves or rounded curves, measured along said street lines. (Amended by

FOOTNOTES TO TABLE OF DIMENSIONAL AND DENSITY REGULATIONS
1. Except in the Rural Residence C, the Planned Commercial, and the Limited Industrial Districts,
no building in any district need have a front setback greater than the front setback of the
principal building(s) existing on the premises as of the effective date of this provision, or the
average front setback of the principal buildings on abutting lots within two hundred and fifty
(250) feet of each lot line facing the same street and located within the same area or district,
whichever is less restrictive. In determining such average, a vacant lot having a frontage of at
least eighty (80) feet shall be considered to have a front setback conforming to the requirements
of this bylaw. (Amended by 10/22/90 STM; approved by AG 1/14/91) (Amended by 10/26/10 STM; approved by AG 2/24/11)
2. Except with respect to principal structures in the Rural Residence B District, in the specific case
of an irregular, narrow, or shallow lot or a lot unusual either in shape or topography, or a lot on
which an existing building became non-conforming by the adoption of this bylaw, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may reduce by special permit the side and rear setback requirements up to a
maximum of fifty percent (50%). The Board may reduce by special permit the front setback
requirement for all buildings and structures up to a maximum of ten percent (10%), except for
accessory buildings or structures exceeding one hundred and fifty (150) square feet in area or
one (1) story in height. (Amended by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93) (Amended
by 10/18/04 STM; approved by AG 1/27/05) (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/16/10)
3. (Reserved)
4. For all lots, except end lots; for end lots there shall be a minimum side width of ten (10) feet.
5. Side setback may be eliminated when party-wall construction will provide continuous building frontage.
6. Providing a minimum of ten (10) feet measured from the street shall be planted open space with
the exception of the access drive.
7. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reduce by special permit the minimum setback requirements
for solar energy collection apparatuses up to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of any such
requirement. (Amended by 10/27/15 Special Town Meeting)
8. If a lot is divided by the boundary line between two underlying Zoning Districts, and an active
use is proposed for that portion of the lot which is located in the less restrictive underlying
Zoning District, the area of the lot within the more restrictive District may be included in
fulfilling dimensional and density regulations for the proposed active use, provided that the
actual use of that portion of the lot which is located in the more restrictive District is proposed to
be passive in nature. (Amended by 10/18/93 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/3/94)
9. In the case of a lot which is located within that portion of the Central Business (CB) District
described in this footnote number 9 and which is an irregular, narrow or shallow lot, or a lot
unusual either in shape or topography, or a lot on which an existing building is non-conforming,
in the reasonable judgment of the Planning Board, the Planning Board may, at its discretion, by
special permit, further reduce lot area, lot width, lot frontage, front, side and rear setbacks,
building area, and/or open space if in the reasonable judgment of the Planning Board said
reduction(s) is (are) consistent with the purpose of this bylaw. The boundaries of said portion of
the Central Business (CB) District shall follow the center line of the street; beginning on the
center line of South Main Street at Choate Bridge; thence westerly along South Main Street,
Market Square and Central Street to Hammatt Street; thence Southerly along Hammatt Street to
Washington Street; thence Easterly on Washington Street to Depot Square; thence Northerly on
Market Street about two hundred (200) feet to a point opposite the Southerly property line of
land now or formerly of John H. Levere (Assessor's Map 42A, Lot 200); thence Easterly along
the Southerly property line of land now or formerly of Daniel D. and Kenneth F. Gibbon
(Assessor's Map 42A, Lot 185) to the channel of the Ipswich River; thence Northerly on the
channel of the Ipswich River to the centerline of South Main Street on Choate Bridge; all as
designated on an amended map on file in the office of the Town Clerk. (Amended by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 1/22/04)
10. (Reserved)

11. The Planning Board may increase the number of dwelling units allowed under this requirement
by special permit if it determines that a proposed multi-family dwelling or multi-family
residential development would provide public benefit to the general public. For the purposes of
this provision, public benefit shall mean contributing to the preservation or creation of affordable
housing as defined in Section IX.I. of this bylaw, or contributing to the enhancement or creation
of public recreational facilities. Multi-family dwellings or developments that provide at least
20% of the additional dwelling units allowed under this footnote as affordable (as defined in
Section IX.I.3.a.i), or which pay a $20,000 affordable housing fee for each unit allowed under
this footnote, will satisfy the public benefit requirement. As a stimulus for creating affordable
housing units, if a multi-family development or dwelling of nine or fewer units meets the
affordability requirement under Section IX.I.3.a.ii by creating an affordable unit, then the fee for
additional units allowed under this footnote shall be $15,000 per unit.
To meet the public benefit requirement related to public recreational facilities, the Applicant
must demonstrate both a community need for the improvements and a nexus between the
improvements and the proposed multi-family housing.
Under no circumstances shall the Planning Board allow less than the following minimum lot area
for multi-family dwellings, multi-family residential development, and mixed residential/business
uses, measured on a per unit basis: In the CB and GB Districts, 5,000 square feet (s.f.) plus 2,000
s.f. per unit for multi-family, and 3,000 s.f. plus 1,500 s.f. per unit for residential mixed uses; in
the IR District, 5,000 s.f. plus 3,500 s.f. per dwelling unit, except for the residential conversion
of buildings containing non-residential uses and in existence on the effective date of this zoning
amendment, for which the minimum lot area shall be no less than 5,000 s.f. plus 2,000 s.f. per
dwelling unit. This footnote shall not apply to parcels in the IR District which have less than
12,000 s.f. of lot area. (Amended by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04; Amended by
11/7/17 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/26/18)
12. Provided that a minimum of fifty (50) feet measured from the property line abutting Route One
shall be landscaped with trees of a minimum caliper of three and one half (3.5) inches and a
minimum density within the fifty (50) foot buffer of one tree per one hundred (100) square feet
in accordance with a landscape plan approved by the Planning Board. No active recreational
uses, such as tennis courts or swimming pools, shall be permitted within the fifty (50) foot
landscaped setback. (Added by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)
13. Provided that a minimum of twenty (20) feet measured from the property line abutting Route
One shall be landscaped with trees of a minimum caliper of three and one half (3.5) inches and a
minimum density within the twenty foot (20) buffer of one (1) tree per one hundred (100) square
feet in accordance with a landscape plan approved by the Planning Board. (Added by 10/22/90 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)
14. The setback from Route One, whether a front, side, or rear setback, shall be minimum of one
hundred (100) feet. (Added by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)
15. Provided that a minimum of fifty (50) feet measured from the property line abutting Route One
shall be landscaped with trees of a minimum caliper of three and one half (3.5) inches and a
minimum density within this fifty (50) foot buffer of one tree per one hundred (100) square feet
in accordance with a landscape plan approved by the Planning Board. (Added by 10/22/90 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)
16. Exclusive of access and/or egress points from the site, the first ten (10) feet of the front yard
setback as measured from the street line, as defined by this bylaw, shall be landscaped with plant
materials to improve the visual appearance of the property, without reducing the visibility at
points of access or egress from the site. The landscaping plan is subject to the approval of the
Planning Board as part of the site plan approval process as defined in Section X. of this bylaw.
(Added by 10/23/95 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/29/96)

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
17. The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section: mailboxes, yard light-posts,
flagpoles, birdhouses, retaining walls, arbors, trellises, signs, sculptures, permanently affixed
playground and picnic equipment, driveways, sidewalks, clotheslines, clothes poles, and
landscaping features. Fences or walls are also exempt from the setbacks established in this
Section, subject to the following requirements: (Added by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/11/93) (Amended by 10/20/97 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/10/98) (Amended by 10/15/07
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
a. For fences that extend beyond the required front yard setback (or the existing principal
building, whichever is closer to the street), the building inspector shall have the authority to
require that it be open and less than six feet in height. This requirement shall be based on a
determination that the proposed fence would create an undue safety or traffic hazard by
reason of impeding minimum sight distance requirements as established by the American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
b. All fences shall be installed so that the finished side faces the abutting properties.
c. A building permit shall be obtained for all fences over six (6) feet in height.
d. All applications for fence installation shall include a plot plan showing the location of the
proposed fencing.
18. The provisions of this Subsection shall not apply to the alteration, reconstruction, extension, or
structural change to a single or two-family residential structure lawfully in existence at the time
of enactment of this amendment under the following circumstances:
a. The proposed changes comply with the height restriction;
b. The proposed changes comply with the requirement for maximum building area, or, if they
do not comply, the proposed changes do not result in an increase in building area on the lot;
c. The proposed changes comply with the requirements for maximum floor area, or, if they do
not comply, the proposed changes do not result in an increase in floor area on the lot;
d. The proposed changes comply with the requirements for minimum open space, or, if they do
not comply, the proposed changes do not result in a decrease in the open space on the lot;
e. The proposed changes comply with the setback requirements, or, if they do not comply, the
proposed changes do not result in a decrease in the distance between any lot line and the
nearest point of the structure;
f. Proposed changes to enlarge the structure do not prevent compliance with regulations
governing the repair, expansion or replacement of septic systems, or with any other
applicable laws or regulations.
For the purposes of this bylaw, an alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change
meeting the criteria set forth in this footnote is not deemed to increase the non-conforming
nature of the structure, and is allowable as a matter of right. (Added by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 1/11/93)
19. Temporary accessory buildings, such as temporary tents and screenhouses, are permitted in the
rear and side setbacks, not less than ten (10) feet from any lot line, from May 15 to September 30
of each year; except that the provisions of Footnote #2 of this Table may not be used further to
reduce a setback to a distance less than that otherwise permitted under the provisions of this
Footnote 19. (Added by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93)
20. The calculation of building area shall not include temporary structures or buildings, such as
temporary tents and screen houses. (Added by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93)
(Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
Page 43
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
21. The calculation of Maximum Floor Area shall not include cellars, basements, garages, areas
under awnings, covered entry landings, decks, or accessory buildings as defined in the
Massachusetts Building Code and this Bylaw, whether or not said areas are designed or used for
human occupancy. Attics are also excluded from the calculation of Maximum Floor Area, unless
they are designed or used for human occupancy.
In the case of rooms with high ceilings where the height is sufficient to construct two (2) habitable
floors under the current standards of the Massachusetts Building Code, the floor area shall be
calculated as that which could be allowable under the current Building Code standards. (Added by
10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93) (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 1/23/08) (Amended by 11/7/17 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/26/18)
22. This requirement shall apply to lots laid out after August 25, 1994. (Added by 10/17/94 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/6/94) Lots laid out prior to that date shall provide a minimum lot
frontage of fifty (50) feet and a minimum lot width of one hundred ninety (190) feet, measured at
the front setback. (Amended by 10/23/95 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/29/96)
23. To calculate area required for zoning compliance, refer to the definition of "Lot Area" in Section
III. of this bylaw. (Added by 10/23/95 Special Town Meeting; approved by 1/29/96 by Attorney General)
24. All principal buildings constructed after September 1, 1996 shall be built to the front setback line
unless granted an exception by a special permit from the Planning Board. (Added by 10/21/96 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/9/96)
25. If a residential development obtains a special permit, waiver or other local approval that
increases the density or intensity of use beyond what is otherwise allowed by the Table of Uses,
said development shall conform to Section IX.I.2.b. (Inclusionary Housing Requirements). (Added
by 10/23/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02) (Amended by 10/15/12 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 2/5/13)
26. The minimum lot size hereunder shall be 43,560 square feet if: (a) a lot exists and is conforming
as of the effective date of this bylaw; and (b) the development fulfills the requirements of
Section IX.I. (Inclusionary Housing Requirements) or it is expressly exempted from said Section
IX.I requirements pursuant to Section IX.I.2.b. (Added by 10/23/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 2/19/02) (Amended by 10/16/06 and 10/15/12 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/4/07 and 2/5/13)
27. No more than one storage shed, having a maximum floor area of one hundred fifty (150) square
feet, may be located not less than five (5) feet from side and rear lot lines. (Added by 10/23/01 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
28. The minimum lot area requirement for a single-family house lot may be reduced by up to 50%
by special permit from the Planning Board, subject to the requirements of Section IX.S. of this
bylaw. (Added by 11/7/17 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/26/18)
29. A principal building may be constructed to a front setback of less than ten (10) feet if granted an
exception by Planning Board special permit. (Added by 10/20/03 STM; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04)
30. Provided that the lot upon which the mixed residential/business use is located is at least 5,000
square feet in area, no additional area is required for non-residential uses. (Added by 10/16/06 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/4/07)

31. In the PC District, for the purpose of minimizing curb cuts along Route One, the following
performance standards shall apply: (Added by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
a. No new curb cut shall be allowed that is closer than 150 linear feet from any existing curb
cut, except as provided in b. or d. below. In addition, new curb cuts on state and local roads
shall be discouraged and developers shall be encouraged to seek access via a common
driveway serving an adjacent lot or premises.
b. Additional curb cuts shall be prohibited as set forth above; however, in general, one
driveway curb cut shall be allowed per business, except that, in the case of a project with
multiple businesses on the same premises, two means of ingress and egress shall be allowed
and they may be constructed to be less than 150 linear feet apart and separated by a median
strip.
c. Curb cuts shall be limited to the minimum width for safe entering and exiting. The Mass
Highway Department Project Development and Design Guide, current version, shall be
used as a guide for determining adequate traffic design standards for any commercial
project.
d. The Planning Board, by special permit, may waive or alter any of the above performance
standards, subject to a finding that said changes do not derogate from the intent of the
Planned Commercial District.

C. Change of Use or Building Expansions
Where a structure is enlarged or a change in an existing use occurs, only the additional parking
spaces required need comply with these formulae.
D. Accessory Use of Parking Areas
No parking space shall be used for any activity which interferes with its availability to meet the
minimum applicable parking requirement. Accessory uses are permitted and may include, but not be

(1/2) or more shall be counted as one (1).
Page 49
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
G. Mixed Use Facilities
Buildings or lots, which contain more than one (1) principal use, are considered Mixed Use facilities.
For the purposes of determining parking requirements for such a facility, parking for two (2) or more
buildings or uses may be provided in combined parking facilities where such facilities will continue
to be available for the several buildings or uses, provided that the total number of spaces is not less
than the sum of the spaces required for each use individually, except that said number of spaces may
be reduced by up to one-half (1/2) such sum if it can be demonstrated that the hours or days of peak
parking for the uses are so different that a lower total will be adequate for all uses served by the
facility. (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)
H. Location of Parking Facilities
All required parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the same lot as the use or building for
which they are required; provided, however, that if sufficient spaces are unavailable on that lot, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize by special permit an alternative location for non-residential
parking in all applicable districts, and residential mixed use parking in the CB District, subject to the
following provisions:
1. The lot to be utilized for parking shall be in the same legal ownership as the lot served either by
deed, by easement, or by long-term lease. If the lot is leased, the terms of the lease shall be
subject to the Zoning Board of Appeal's approval as to form and duration. Such deed, easement,
or notice of lease shall be recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and a copy of the same as recorded
shall be filed with and made part of the application for any building or occupancy permit.
2. The linear distance between the use or building lot and its parking lot shall not be more than five
hundred (500) feet.
3. The separate parking lot shall not create unreasonable traffic congestion or create a hazard to
pedestrians being served by the parking lot.
4. The parking lot shall be properly zoned for the same or a less restrictive use as the principal lot
being served by the parking lot. Provided, however, in the case of lots situated in more than one
district, not more than twenty percent (20%) [or ten (10) spaces, whichever is the lesser] of the
parking and loading spaces required for the use of the less restrictively zoned portion of the lot
may be located in the more restrictively zoned portion of the lot, so long as the parking and
loading spaces and any necessary drives or other paved areas do not extend more than fifty (50)
feet into the more restrictively zoned parcel, and all other setbacks, screening, dimensional,
density, and other requirements of this bylaw are complied with. (Amended by 10/18/93 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/3/94 and by 10/16/18 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/19)
I. Municipal Parking Lot Exemption
Business uses need not provide off-street parking if they are located in the Central Business District
or within five hundred (500) feet of either the municipally-owned parking spaces in the Hammatt
Street Parking Lot (identified as all or part of Lots #226, #228 and #235 on Assessor's Map 42A and
Lot #298A on Assessor's Map 41B), or the Elm Street Municipal Parking Lot (identified as all or
part of Lots #111, #113 and #114 on Assessor's Map 42A). Mixed residential uses located in the CB
District within 500 feet of the aforementioned parking lots, may, by Planning Board special permit,
be exempted from the on-site parking requirement, in whole or in part, provided the Board finds that
granting a full or partial exemption is not contrary to the public interest. (Amended by 10/20/03 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04; and by 10/16/18 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/19)
J. Loading Requirements
Minimum off-street loading requirements shall be required in accordance with the formulae set forth
below for every new structure, new use, enlargement of an existing structure and/or change in an
existing use. Where the structure is enlarged and/or there is a change in the existing use, the formulae
shall apply only to the enlargement and/or change.
Off-street loading areas shall be provided in accordance with the TABLE OF LOADING
REQUIREMENTS as outlined below:

K. Design Standards for Parking Facilities
The minimum dimensions of parking spaces and maneuvering aisles for all uses except detached
single family and two family dwelling units on their own separate lots, shall be as follows: (Amended
by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
Parking
Angle (A)
Stall Width (B)** Stall Depth (C)*** Aisle Width (D) Curb Length (E)

**End spaces, restricted on one of the long sides by curbs, walls, fences, or other similar obstructions, shall have a
minimum width of ten (10) feet, and maneuvering space at the aisle end of at least five (5) feet in depth and nine (9) feet
in width.
***May include no more than two (2) feet of landscaped island or setback area at the front of the space, provided there
are not obstructions to the vehicle's bumper overhang and provided, further, that the bumper overhang does not interfere
with the availability of the island or setback area for snow storage.
For parking facilities developed in conjunction with a development requiring site plan approval or a special
permit, the Planning Board by special permit may reduce the above required dimensions or the dimensions
listed in subsections L. and M. below, up to a maximum of twenty-five percent (25%), based on a
determination that the special circumstances of the development permit a lesser standard than otherwise
required. Compact spaces may account for up to thirty percent (30%) of the total spaces in a lot. The layout
of standard and compact spaces and aisles should be done in such a way so that the smallest feasible paved
parking area results. All compact spaces shall be clearly marked. (Added by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 1/27/05) (Amended by 10/19/09 and 10/17/11 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10 and 2/2/12,
respectively)
L. Loading Space Dimensions
Each loading space shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width by sixty (60) feet in length, and shall be
provided with a fourteen (14) foot high clearance. This space shall be exclusive of drives, aisles, or
maneuvering space.
Page 51
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
M. Parking and Loading Layout
1. Circulation  Driveways and parking areas shall be designed with due regard to topography,
integration with surrounding streets, general interior circulation and separation of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic to reduce hazards to pedestrians and motorists.
2. Layout  Required parking and loading facilities shall be laid out so that each vehicle may
proceed to and from its parking space without requiring the movement of any other vehicle. The
Board may waive this requirement for parking facilities under full-time attendant supervision.
In no case shall parking or loading spaces be located so as to require the backing or maneuvering
of a vehicle onto a sidewalk or onto a public way in order to enter or leave the space.
3. In no case shall surface parking or loading spaces be located less than ten (10) feet from any side
or rear lot line excluding corner lots, as provided for under paragraph #4 below. (Amended by 10/17/05
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/12/05)
4. No parking of motor vehicles or driveway serving a parking or loading facility shall be located
within thirty (30) feet of an intersection of two (2) street lines.
5. Except in the Industrial, Limited Industrial, and Highway Business District, no off-street parking
facility shall be located within the front setback. However, in the Highway Business (HB)
District, the number of off-street parking spaces allowed in the front yard setback shall not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total off-street parking spaces required by this bylaw. (Amended
by 10/23/95 Special Town Meeting; approved 1/29/96 Attorney General) Additionally, within the Limited Industrial
District, no parking facilities shall be located within the required fifty (50) foot landscaped
setback from Route One. Further, within the Planned Commercial District, no parking facilities
shall be allowed within the required twenty (20) foot landscaped setback from Route One;
however, a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of required parking spaces of
a lot may be located within the remaining portion of the minimum setback from Route One not
subject to landscape requirements. Also, except as noted above in this section, in the Planned
Commercial, Limited Industrial and Rural Residence C Districts, in no instance shall any
parking or loading be allowed in any of the minimum setback requirements or required open
space. (Amended by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/11/93; further amended by 10/18/93
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/3/94)
N. Handicapped Parking
Parking facilities shall provide specially designed parking spaces for the physically handicapped in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Architectural Access Board of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts Department of Public Safety.
Handicapped spaces shall be clearly identified by signs indicating that the spaces are reserved for
physically handicapped persons. Such spaces shall be located nearest to the handicapped entrance to
the use or building served.
O. Surfacing, Drainage and Curbing
All parking facilities shall be graded, surfaced with non-erosive material, and drained in an adequate
manner to prevent nuisance of erosion or excessive water flow across public ways or abutting
properties. To reduce stormwater discharge and improve the attenuation of pollutants, low impact
development integrated stormwater management practices, to the extent feasible, shall be
incorporated into parking facilities of twenty (20) or more spaces. Techniques that limit the overall
impervious coverage of the parking facility, such as replacement of bituminous concrete with
pervious pavers or porous asphalt, are strongly encouraged where appropriate. For additional
guidance on possible techniques, applicants should refer to the Ipswich General Bylaw entitled
Ipswich Stormwater Management Bylaw. (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General
1/23/08) (Amended by 10/19/09 STM; approved by AG 5/17/10; amended by 10/17/11 STM; approved by Attorney General 2/2/12)
Entrance and exit driveways shall be defined clearly with curbing, signs, and pavement markings.
Parking and loading spaces shall be marked clearly in accordance with dimensions specified in
subsections J, K, and M above.

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
P. Landscaping
In order to separate parking areas from abutting streets, to provide areas for disposal of snow, and to
provide visual relief from expanses of pavement and vehicles, landscaping shall be provided in all
parking areas containing ten (10) or more parking spaces. Said landscaping shall include the
establishment of vegetative or structural buffers on the perimeter of all parking areas to prevent
direct views of parked vehicles from streets and sidewalks, avoid spillover light, glare, noise, or
exhaust fumes onto adjacent properties, and to provide the parking area with a reasonable measure of
shade when trees reach maturity. Vegetative or structural buffers shall be no less than five (5) feet
high. Buffers may be a hedge, wall, fence, berm or combination of these choices. The height of any
buffer shall decrease where driveways approach sidewalks, walking paths, and streets in order to
provide adequate visibility of pedestrians from motor vehicles and to maintain a clear line of sight
for vehicles entering the roadway. At least ten percent (10%) of the internal area of a paved parking
facility, exclusive of perimeter landscaping, shall be planted with landscaped island areas. To the
extent feasible, landscaping materials used in islands or in the perimeter areas of parking lots shall be
drought resistant and salt tolerant non-invasive species, and such areas shall be designed to receive
and accommodate runoff. Landscaping shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Planning
Board, for all projects which require Site Plan Review approval or a Planning Board Special Permit.
(Added by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05) (Added by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved
by Attorney General 5/17/10)
Q. Lighting
All lighting within parking areas shall be arranged so as to prevent direct glare upon any public way
or upon any other abutting property. Lighting shall be provided, where desirable, to improve safety
and visibility of the lot.
R. Maintenance
Parking and loading facilities and landscaping shall be continuously maintained in good condition to
ensure continued compliance with the provisions of this section.

window signs.
C. Sign Standards and Requirements
1. General Requirements
The following general requirements shall apply to all signs, except as otherwise noted:
a. Illumination
Sign illumination is permitted only between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., except that
signs for non-residential uses may be illuminated during any hours the establishments are open
to the public. Externally or reverse lit illuminated signs are allowed by right, while internally
and/or intermittently lit signs are allowed only by special permit. Exposed sources of
illumination, such as neon tubes, are not permitted, nor are signs that cause harmful glare to
motorists, pedestrians or neighboring premises. All illuminated signs must be so shielded,
shaded, directed or maintained at a sufficiently low level of intensity and brightness so that the
illumination does not adversely affect neighboring properties or the safe and convenient use of
public ways.
b. Sign Area Measurement
Sign area shall be calculated as follows:
i. For two-dimensional double-faced hanging and freestanding signs, the area shall be based on
one face.
Page 55
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
ii. For two-dimensional signs affixed to or fabricated from a mounting background or
signboard, the area shall consist of the smallest rectangular area that wholly contains the
sign, as shown in diagram #1.
iii. For two-dimensional signs consisting of individual letters or symbols affixed directly to a
building wall, window, freestanding sign supports, or awning, the area shall consist of the
smallest area which encompasses all of the letters and symbols, as shown in diagram #2. In
the case of freestanding signs, the area is exclusive of the sign supports.
c. Projection: Signs shall project no more than five (5) feet from a building or over more than
two-thirds (2/3) of the width of a sidewalk, whichever is less, as shown in diagram #3.
d. Sign Location: Except for freestanding signs, all signs must be attached to the portion of the
building that corresponds to the portion owned or leased by the sign permit applicant.
e. Sign Mounting Height: The highest part of wall, window and awning signs may not exceed
twenty (20) feet above grade.
2. Requirements Based on Sign Type
a. Awning Signs
Awning signs shall be painted on, or attached flat against, the surface of the awning or
canopy. Attaching a sign to an awning or canopy in any other manner is prohibited.
b. Freestanding Signs
Freestanding signs shall be mounted permanently on the ground, located on the same lot as
the principal building, and set back at least five (5) feet from any property line. Signs shall
be situated so as to not impair visibility or restrict the ability to use any public way by
impeding minimum sight distance requirements established by the American Association of
State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and as interpreted by the Building
Inspector. Freestanding signs shall not be mounted on trees, utility poles, light fixtures, or
any other structure that is not built solely to accommodate signs.
c. Hanging Signs
Signs hanging over a public way or area accessible to the public shall provide at least ten
(10) feet of clearance measured from the ground surface to the bottom of the sign, as shown
in diagram #3, and shall not impair visibility or restrict the ability to use any public way or
area accessible to the public.
Page 56
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
d. Wall Signs
Wall signs must be mounted parallel to the wall of a building and shall not project more than
one (1) foot beyond the face of the wall to which they are attached.
D. Sign Allowances Based on Type and District
Table A: Sign Allowances by Type and District, Table B: Maximum Number and Area of Signs Allowed
by District, and Table C: Temporary Sign Allowances, are provided on accompanying pages and are a
part of this Section.
E. Sign Allowances for Institutional Uses

events is not limited. Signs shall be removed no later than five days after the advertised event has
ended; and
4. One (1) wall sign per building (except for a corner lot, for which one (1) sign shall be allowed facing
each of the frontage streets), having a maximum area of twenty (20) square feet, a maximum height
of twenty (20) feet, and a maximum letter height of fourteen (14) inches.
The total area of all signs allowed for an institutional use shall not exceed fifty (50) square feet or twenty
percent (20%) of the total first floor building façade area, whichever is less. The first floor building façade
area shall be calculated by multiplying the lineal frontage of a building/storefront by its total first floor or
entrance level height, as shown in diagram #4.
F. Sign Permitting

I. Special Permits:
1. Applicability
The following signs are allowed only by the issuance of a special permit:
a. Signs allowed by this Section that are associated with projects requiring Site Plan Review or
a Special Permit from the Planning Board;
b. Signs allowed by this Section that exceed either the dimensional requirements for height,
area, letter height, setback, projection, and illumination; or the allowed number of signs, as
listed in the Tables referenced in D. above; and
c. Internally illuminated and/or intermittent signs.
2. Special Permit Granting Authority
The Planning Board shall serve as the Special Permit Granting Authority (SPGA) for signs associated
with projects requiring a Planning Board Special Permit. For signs described in I.1.b and c. above that
are not associated with projects requiring a Planning Board Special Permit, the Zoning Board of Appeals
(ZBA) shall serve as the SPGA.
Page 58
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
3. Signs Associated with Site Plan Review
Signs associated with projects requiring Site Plan Review approval from the Planning Board are subject
to the requirements of this Section. For signs associated with Site Plan Review applications described in
I.1.b and c. above, the Planning Board will serve as the SPGA.
4. Required Findings
A Special Permit for a sign may be issued if the SPGA makes the following findings:
a. Sign scale is determined to be reasonably related to building and site development, viewer
distance and travel speed, and sign sizes on nearby structures;
b. Sign size, shape, and placement serve to define or enhance architectural elements of the
building such as columns, sill lines, cornices, and roof edges, and does not unreasonably
interrupt, obscure, or hide them;
c. Sign design is in reasonable continuity with the mounting location, height, proportions and
materials of other signs on the same or adjacent buildings or fixtures;
d. Sign materials, colors, lettering style, illumination and form are reasonably compatible with
building design, neighborhood context and use;
e. Sign size, location, design and illumination do not present a safety hazard to vehicular or
pedestrian traffic; and
f. For signs which exceed the quantity and dimensional requirements, the sign complies with
all provisions of this Section other than those for which relief is being sought.
J. Nonconformance of Signs
Pursuant to Section II. A of this zoning bylaw, any sign legally erected before the adoption of this
Section that does not conform to its provisions may continue to be maintained. Pursuant to Section
II.B.2 of this zoning bylaw, any such sign may be subsequently enlarged, altered, replaced, changed,
or relocated after the adoption of this Section by grant of a special permit from the Zoning Board of
Appeals, provided that such enlargement, alteration, replacement, change or relocation does not
increase an existing nonconformity or create a new nonconformity. Minor changes to a
nonconforming sign, such as changing a panel on a directory sign, updating a sign without changing
its size and dimension, or small repairs, are not considered an alteration and thus do not require a
special permit from the ZBA.

IX. SPECIAL REGULATIONS
A. Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Zoning (OSPZ)
1. Purpose: The purpose of the Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Zoning Bylaw is to:
a. Conserve the Town's significant open space and to protect its natural features, including
historic farms and landscapes, wetlands, forests, the Ipswich River, and the Area of Critical
Environmental Concern (ACEC);
b. Foster housing patterns which are sensitive to and accommodate a site's physical
characteristics;
c. Encourage the use of open space for agricultural use, conservation and/or passive recreation
use;
d. Promote more efficient provision of streets, utilities and other public services by allowing a
concentration of dwelling units without an increase in overall density. (Added by 4/5/99 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99)
2. Applicability: Any proposed development in the Town of Ipswich which would create six or
more single-family attached or detached dwellings, on a property or set of commonly-owned
contiguous properties containing a minimum of four (4) acres, shall be required to submit a
special permit application to the Planning Board for Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Zoning
in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, contiguous
properties include those that are separated by a road or way, provided the properties have at least
five hundred (500) feet of directly opposing frontage on the same segment of the road or way.
The applicant may also submit a conventional subdivision plan at the same time, in accordance
with the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich. The Planning
Board shall, in compliance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40A, Section 9, hold a
public hearing on the proposed Open Space Preservation (Cluster) application, and a concurrent
public hearing on the proposed conventional subdivision, if applicable. In the event both an
Open Space Preservation (Cluster) plan and a conventional subdivision plan are submitted, prior
to the close of the public hearing, the Planning Board shall recommend which plan it considers
most beneficial to the Town, and the applicant shall, also prior to the close of the public hearing,
elect which plan he wishes to pursue, and shall inform the Planning Board of his choice in
writing. For subdivisions which would create five or fewer lots, on a property or set of
commonly-owned properties containing a minimum of five (5) acres, an applicant may submit a
special permit application for Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Zoning, in preference to filing a
conventional subdivision plan. Any special permit application submitted under the provisions of
this subsection, which involves the subdivision of land, shall be subject to the approval of the
Planning Board under the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich.
(Added by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99) (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 2/19/02) (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
3. Permitted Uses: The following principal developed uses of the lots shall be permitted:
a. Single-family attached
b. Single-family detached
c. Community uses
d. Religious uses
e. Educational uses
f. Membership club for the use of residents of the development
g. Country, fishing, tennis, boating, golf or similar club
h. Common driveways up to five lots
(Amended by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99)
Page 62
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
4. Density Standards: (Amended by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99)
a. Base Density:
For the purposes of determining the total number of allowable dwelling units on an entire
tract, the total number of proposed dwelling units in the development shall not exceed the
number of dwelling units which would be developed under normal application of zoning
requirements for detached single-family dwelling units under the "Town of Ipswich Rules
and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land" and in accordance with Section
VI. DIMENSIONAL AND DENSITY REGULATIONS of the "Protective Zoning Bylaw of
the Town of Ipswich". The developer shall submit a Yield Plan which indicates the
maximum number of lots achievable under a conventional layout which generally complies
with the Town of Ipswich Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land,
without altering any land areas in which such activity would be precluded by normal
application of state and town laws and regulations governing wetlands and riverfront areas,
or by the existence of floodplain areas. In unsewered areas, the developer shall provide
evidence acceptable to the Planning Board that individual on-site wastewater treatment and
disposal systems may be permitted and constructed to serve all the lots proposed under the
Yield Plan as submitted. This evidence shall include a demonstration of suitable soil and
groundwater conditions through representative sampling and testing of the buildable areas of
the site by means and methods approved by the Board of Health and shall at a minimum
consist of one determination of soil permeability and one observation of maximum ground
water elevation per two acres of otherwise buildable land, such tests being distributed with
reasonable uniformity over the site. For the yield plan to be approved, all such
determinations and observations shall meet the above presumption, except that if more than
five (5) determinations and observations are made, only seventy-five percent (75%) of said
determinations and observations need demonstrate the above presumption. (Amended by 10/16/00
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 3/8/01) (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 1/27/05) (Amended by 5/8/18 Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/27/18)
b. Wetlands/Coastal Exclusion:
For tracts which contain wetlands and/or flood plain, only one-half (1/2) the area designated
as wetlands and/or floodplain may be considered when calculating the total area of the tract.
For the purposes of determining lot area(s) the Federal Insurance Floodplain Maps (FIRM),
310 CMR 10.00 and the Town of Ipswich General Wetlands Bylaw shall be used to identify
floodplain and wetland areas. (Added by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
c. Maximum Density:
In the RRC District in no circumstances shall the total number of units obtained through
application of the above density formulae exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the
base density allowed under a. above, except as described below. In the RRA District in no
circumstances shall the total number of units obtained through application of the above
density formulae exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the base density allowed under a.
above, except as follows:
i. The Applicant submits an OSPZ application in accordance with the provisions of IX.I.
Inclusionary Housing Requirements.
ii. An OSPZ application submitted in accordance with the provisions of IX.I may be allowed an
increase over the overall density that is achievable under said Section, subject to the
following conditions and limitations:
a) An OSPZ application which provides an open space set aside of greater than the required
fifty percent (50%) may be entitled to a density bonus, under the general rule that at least
10% of additional satisfactory open space be provided in order to receive a bonus that is
equivalent to an additional house lot. In no instance shall a density bonus awarded under
subparagraph i. exceed one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the achievable density
under IX.I.
Page 63
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
b) An OSPZ application which provides greater affordability than that required under IX.I
may be entitled to a density bonus, under the general rule that at least one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the required affordability be provided in order to receive a bonus that
is equivalent to three additional house lots. In no instance shall a density bonus awarded
under this subparagraph ii. exceed one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the
achievable density under IX.I.
c) In no instance shall the overall density be more than two times what can be achieved under
conventional two-acre zoning. (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
(Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
5. Development Requirements:
a. Town Water: The development shall be served by a water system deemed adequate for fire
protection and domestic use by the Water Commissioners and by the Fire Chief.
b. Sanitary Sewer/Septic: The property shall be served by the Town's sanitary sewer system, by
a private central sanitary sewer system, or by individual septic systems. If, however, in the
judgment of the Board, the topography and/or soil conditions are such that it would be more
efficient to allow the underground common septic system or individual septic systems to be
placed in the preserved open space, this configuration may be permitted. All systems are
subject to approval by the Board of Health and any other permitting authority of competent
jurisdiction.
c. Open Space Restriction: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the lot shall be:
(Amended in its entirety by 10/16/00 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 3/8/01.) (Amended by 10/15/01
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
i. Conveyed to the Town of Ipswich and accepted by it for open space use;
ii. Conveyed to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of a state forest, park, or
wildlife management area;
iii. Conveyed to a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation
of open space, and made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance
with the provisions of Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of Chapter 184 of the General Laws
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; or
iv. Conveyed to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or
residential units within the plot; or
v. Made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Section 31 and Section 33, inclusive, of chapter 184 of the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts running in favor of either the Town or, upon the
approval of the Planning Board, a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which
is the conservation of open space. The conservation restriction shall provide that such
land shall be kept, in perpetuity, in an open or natural state, in accordance with the
above-noted sections of Chapter 184 of the General Laws.
vi. The open space, in its entirety or a percentage thereof, may be held in non-common
ownership, if approved by the Planning Board. (Added by 10/23/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 2/19/02)
The method of protecting open space requires the approval of the Planning Board.
In designating open space, the Applicant shall apply guidelines entitled CRITERIA FOR
EVALUATING OPEN SPACE, adopted by the Planning Board and amended from time to time. The
open space shall be available for use by the general public, unless the applicant can provide
compelling reasons to the Planning Board why such access would be infeasible in whole or in part.

Attorney General 2/19/02)
e. Application and Review Process:
All special permit applications for Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Zoning shall be made and filed
on the appropriate application form. For an application to be considered complete, it shall provide all
information required by the Rules and Regulations Governing Granting of Special Permits, available
from the Department of Planning and Development.
If a proposed development filed under this subsection also requires subdivision approval, the applicant
shall submit, along with the special permit application, a subdivision concept plan. The concept plan
should address the general features of the land, and give approximate configurations of the lots and
roadways. Imaginative and creative land use planning should be applied, with the aim of preventing
damage to the landscape, topography and valuable and nonrenewable natural resources of the Town.
The concept plan shall be prepared by a registered professional land surveyor and a registered
professional landscape architect, and the plan shall include all information required in the Planning
Boards rules and regulations, as described in paragraph 7. of this subsection A.
Within ten days of receipt of a concept plan and/or special permit application, the Planning Board shall
transmit a copy of the plan and/or application and to the Open Space Committee, which shall review
the application and submit its recommendation to the Planning Board within thirty (30) days of the
referral of the application. The approved special permit shall incorporate protection of the natural
features to the greatest extent possible. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
If the Planning Board approves a special permit for an open space preservation development requiring
subdivision approval, the applicant shall then submit a definitive subdivision plan to the Planning
Board under the Rules and Regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Ipswich.
Although the applicant has the option of submitting a preliminary plan instead of a definitive plan, the
approved special permit will be considered to have served the purpose of a preliminary subdivision
plan.
Page 65
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
The Planning Board shall reconsider the aforementioned subdivision concept plan if there is
substantial variation between the preliminary or definitive plan and the concept plan. A
substantial variation shall be defined as an increase in the number of building lots, a decrease
in the open space acreage, a change in the layout which causes dwelling units or road ways
to be placed significantly closer to a dwelling unit within five hundred (500) feet of the
project, and/or a change in the general development pattern. If the Planning Board finds that
a substantial variation exists, it shall hold a public hearing on the modifications to the
concept plan. (Added by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99)
Construction of streets shall be in accordance with the Rules and Regulations Governing the
Subdivision of Land in the Town of Ipswich. Streets may be offered for acceptance as public
ways.
f. Limitation of Subdivision:
No lot shown on a plan for which a permit is granted under this section may be further
subdivided, and a notation to this effect shall be shown on the plans.
6. Common Driveways.
Common driveways serving no more than eight (8) residential lots are allowed in Open Space
Preservation Zoning Developments, provided that they meet the following requirements:
a. The common driveway complies with Section IX.E.2., paragraphs a. through d., of this
zoning bylaw.
b. The common driveway shall access the property over the frontage of at least one of the lots
being served by the driveway.
c. The owners of the properties to be served by the common driveway must provide evidence
to the Building Inspector that they have rights, either by deed or perpetual easement, to the
common driveway.
d. The common driveways shall provide adequate access and turnaround for vehicles including
moving vans, ambulances, fire and police vehicles. To provide such adequate access, the
common driveway shall be built to meet the following standards:
i. Width Sixteen (16) feet, except for driveways serving two (2) lots,
in which case the width may be a minimum of twelve (12)
feet. The Planning Board may allow driveways serving up to
five (5) lots to be less than sixteen (16) feet in width if
turnouts are provided in a satisfactory manner. (Amended by
10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)
ii. Turnaround Cul-de-sac having an outside paving diameter of at least
ninety (90) feet. As an alternative, the Planning Board may
allow a "T" or "Y" shaped turnaround.
iii. Pavement Class I, Type I-1 plant-mixed bituminous concrete, in
accordance with Appendix 1(A)(5 and 6) of the Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich,
Massachusetts.
iv. Grade Fourteen percent (14%) maximum. (Amended by 10/15/01 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
v. Leveling Area If the grade of the common driveway exceeds six percent
(6%) on the approach to an intersection, leveling area with a
slope of not more than four percent (4%) shall be provided
for a distance not less than fifty (50) feet from the
intersecting street.
Page 66
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
The width, grade and leveling area standards specified above shall apply only to that portion
of a driveway which is used in common by more than two (2) lots. Further, the Planning
Board may waive strict compliance with the width and pavement requirements if it
determines that such a waiver can be granted without adversely affecting public access.
(Added by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
e. If the terminus of the common driveway is greater than five hundred (500) feet from an
existing hydrant, as measured along said driveway, an eight-inch diameter water main and
hydrant acceptable to the Department of Utilities shall be installed.
f. The special permit approval shall be subject to a covenant by and between the developer and
the Planning Board recorded in the chain of title and running with the land, on a form
approved by the Planning Board, acknowledging that the common driveway special permit
was granted in consideration of the conditions contained within the special permit and the
grant of covenant, and that the common driveway is a private driveway that serves more than
one (1) lot, and the owner, his heirs, executors, successors and assigns, agree that the
common driveway shall never be submitted to Town Meeting for a vote to have it become an
accepted street. This paragraph authorizes the Planning Board to accept the covenant on
behalf of the Town.
g. The special permit approval shall require the applicant to record with the permit a
declaration of covenants and easements which provides for a method of maintenance of the
drive, and which obligates that present and future owners of the lots be responsible for the
maintenance of the common driveway. (Added by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 8/2/99)
If any of the following conditions are met, applicants are encouraged to construct common driveways,
provided they still meet conditions a. through g. of this section:
(1) The provision of individual driveways to the lots to be served by the proposed common
driveway would require curb cuts which are separated by less than sixty (60) feet along the
exterior street line.
(2) The provision of individual driveways to the lots to be served by the proposed common
driveway would allow no alternative but to cross a "Wetland Resource Area", as defined by
M.G.L. Chapter 131 Section 40, and/or the Town of Ipswich Wetlands Protection Bylaw, or
to cross a "Flood Plain" as described in Section IX. D. of this zoning bylaw.
(3) One or more alternative individual driveways which would be necessary in the absence of
the proposed common driveway would intersect the roadway at a point of insufficient traffic
sight distance, as determined by the Ipswich Planning Board.
(4) The provision of driveways to the lots to be served by the proposed common driveway
would adversely affect a significant natural feature or vista. (Amended by 10/19/09 STM; approved by AG
5/17/10)
7. Adoption of Rules and Regulations:
The Board shall adopt an application form and rules and regulations in accordance with the
provisions of this bylaw. Rules and regulations shall specify the application process, type and
number of required plans, and general requirements in order to assist the developer in complying
with the intent of this bylaw. (Section A. amended by 10/17/92 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General
1/11/93) (First sentence and Section A amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)

state regulations. The WSPD shall apply to all: (a) new construction; (b) reconstruction or expansion
of existing buildings; and (c) new or expanded uses in zones delineated for water supply protection.
Specifically exempted from this section is normal household use of hazardous materials. Applicable
activities and uses in a portion of one of the underlying zoning districts which fall within the WSPD
must additionally comply with the requirements of this district. Uses prohibited in the underlying
zoning districts shall not be permitted in the WSPD.
3. Definitions. The following terms used in this section are defined in SECTION III of the zoning
bylaw: Groundwater, Impervious Surface, Normal Household Use, Potential Drinking Water
Sources, Recharge Areas, Treatment Works, Very Small Quantity Generator, and Water Supply
Protection District.
4. For the purposes of this section, a Hazardous Material is defined as follows: Any substance or
mixture of physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics posing a significant actual or potential
hazard to water supplies or other hazards to human health were such substance or mixture released in
the Town of Ipswich. Hazardous materials include, without limitation; synthetic organic chemicals,
petroleum products, heavy metals, radioactive or infectious wastes, acids and alkalis, and all
substances defined as Toxic or Hazardous under Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter(c.)
21C and 21E and 310 CMR 30.00.
5. Establishment and Delineation of WSPD. The WSPD established in this section consists of
watersheds or recharge areas which are delineated on a map entitled "Water Supply Protection
District, Town of Ipswich," and is dated September 19, 2003. This map is hereby made a part of the
Official Zoning Map of the Town of Ipswich and is on file in the Office of the Town Clerk. The
boundaries of the WSPD do not necessarily coincide with property lines. In such instances, the
regulations of this section shall apply only to that portion of a lot which lies within the WSPD.
6. The WSPD consists of four zones (A, C, I, II), defined in 310 CMR 22.02. These zones are drawn
around surface water supplies, community water supplies, and non-community water supplies as
defined in 310 CMR 22.02.
7. Use Regulations.
a. Within the Water Supply Protection District all of the requirements of the underlying zoning
districts continue to apply except that:
i. Uses designated with a dash () in the Water Supply Protection Table of Uses shall
not be permitted; and
ii. Uses designated with "SPB" may only be permitted by special permit from the
Planning Board, even if the underlying district requirements are more permissive.
b. Uses designated with "P" or NA shall be controlled by requirements of underlying zoning
districts.
c. For uses located in areas within both the Zone A and Zone II, the most restrictive
requirement shall apply.

2 Vegetated buffer strips means either Filter Strips or Field Borders as defined in the MADEP Nonpoint Source
Management Manual, and shall be not less than one hundred (100) feet in width.
3 NRCS Handbook available in Planning Office, Town Hall.
4 The system of storm water management and artificial recharge of precipitation shall be designed to prevent untreated
discharges to wetland and surface water; preserve hydrologic conditions that closely resemble pre-development
conditions; reduce or prevent flooding by managing peak discharges and volumes of runoff; minimize erosion and
sedimentation; not result in significant degradation of groundwater; reduce suspended solids and other pollutants to
improve water quality; and provide increased protection of sensitive natural resources.
These standards may be met using the following or similar best management practices:
(a) For single or two family residences, recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates natural
drainage patterns and vegetation to maintain pre-development stormwater patterns and water quality to the
greatest extent possible. Stormwater runoff from rooftops, driveways and other impervious surfaces shall
be routed through vegetated water quality swales, as sheet flow over lawn areas or to constructed
stormwater wetlands, sand filters, infiltration systems, organic filters and/or similar systems.
(b) For multi-family residential and non-residential uses, a stormwater management plan shall be developed
which provides for the artificial recharge of precipitation to groundwater through site design that
incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation and uses constructed (stormwater) wetlands, wet
(detention) ponds, water quality swales, sand filters, organic filters, infiltration systems, or similar site
appropriate best management practices capable of removing nitrogen and other contaminants from
stormwater, in compliance with the Stormwater Management Standards and technical guidance contained
in the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protections 1997 Stormwater Management
Handbook, Volumes 1 and 2. No runoff shall be discharged directly to rivers, streams, and other surface
water bodies, wetlands or vernal pools.
Except when used for roof runoff from non-galvanized roofs, all such wetlands, ponds, swales or other
infiltration facilities shall be preceded by oil, grease and sediment traps or other best management
practices to facilitate control of hazardous materials spills and removal of contamination and to avoid
sedimentation of treatment and leaching facilities. All such artificial recharge systems shall be maintained
in full working order by the owner(s) under the provisions of an operations and maintenance plan
approved by the permitting authority to ensure that systems function as designed. Infiltration systems
greater than three (3) feet deep shall be located at least one hundred (100) feet from drinking water wells.
Any infiltration basins or trenches shall be constructed with a three (3) foot minimum separation between
the bottom of the structure and maximum groundwater elevation.

Meeting; approved by Attorney General 6/11/12)
i. All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements to existing
structures, and other developments are prohibited. If the Zoning Board of Appeals
finds that any of the above will not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the one hundred (100) year flood, the Zoning Board of Appeals may allow
such by special permit.
ii. Any encroachment meeting the above standard shall comply with all flood plain
requirements of the State Building Code.
d. In the AO zones, the lowest floor of new construction of substantial improvements shall be

the best available Federal, State, local, or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit
encroachments in floodways which would result in any increase in flood levels within
Ipswich during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Base flood elevation data is
required for subdivision proposals or other developments greater than fifty (50) lots or five
(5) acres, whichever is the lesser, within unnumbered A zones. (Added by 10/18/99 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/5/00) (Amended by 5/8/12 Annual Town Meeting; approved by AGeneral 6/11/12)
f. Within Zones AH and AO on the FIRM, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
will be required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Added by

E. Common Driveways
1. Purpose
The purposes of providing access to no more than two (2) residential lots over a common
driveway, rather than by individual driveways on each lot, are:
a. To enhance public safety by reducing the number and frequency of points at which vehicle
may enter upon the ways used by the public, particularly arterial streets as defined in the
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts;
b. To preserve, protect and enhance environmentally sensitive land, such as well recharge
areas, wetlands and flood plains, by reducing the area of land that is cleared, excavated,
filled and/or covered with impervious surface;
c. To encourage the protection and preservation of significant natural features and vistas.
2. Applicability and Requirements
Common driveways serving no more than two (2) lots, each with approved frontage on a street,
are allowed as-of-right provided they meet the following requirements: (Amended 10/19/09 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/16/10)
a. The common driveway shall not be in excess of five hundred (500) feet in length.
b. The common driveway shall not enter any roadway at a point separated by less than one
hundred (100) feet from an intersection. On a state-numbered highway, the common
driveway shall not enter the roadway at a point separated by less than one hundred (100) feet
from any other driveway, curb cut, or intersection.
c. The common driveway shall not be allowed if it would serve as the primary means of access
to property which is publicly controlled or which serves a public purpose.
d. Permanent signs indicating the street number address assigned to each lot served by the
common driveway shall be installed within ten (10) feet of the intersection of the common
driveway with the street, as well as within ten (10) feet of the intersection of an individual
lot driveway with the common driveway.
e. The common driveway shall access the property over the frontage of either or both of the
lots being served by the driveway.
f. The owners of the properties to be served by the common driveway must provide evidence
to the Building Inspector that they have rights, either by deed or perpetual easement, to the
common driveway.
g. The common driveway shall be no less than twelve (12) feet in width and shall be treated
with an all-weather surface. The width requirement shall apply only to that portion of a
driveway which is used in common by more than one (1) lot. (Added by 4/07/97 Annual Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 7/02/97)

F. Adult Entertainment Establishments
(Added 10/21/96 by Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/9/96)
1. Purpose and Intent
It has been documented in numerous other towns and cities throughout the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and elsewhere in the United States that Adult Entertainment Establishments are
distinguishable from other business uses and that the location of adult entertainment uses
degrades the quality of life in the areas of a community where they are located. Studies have
shown secondary impacts such as increased levels of crime and blight resulting from the
clustering and concentration of Adult Entertainment uses. Late night noise and traffic also
increase due to the late hours of operation of many of these Establishments. This subsection is
enacted pursuant to MGL Chapter 40A, Section 9 and the Home Rule Amendment to the
Massachusetts Constitution with the purpose and intent of regulating and limiting the location of
Adult Entertainment Establishments (as defined herein) so as to prevent the secondary effects
associated with these establishments, and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
present and future inhabitants of the Town of Ipswich.
The provisions of this subsection have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative matter or materials, including sexually oriented
matter or materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this subsection to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented matter or materials protected by the Constitution of the
United States or of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nor restrict nor deny rights that
distributors or exhibitors of such matter or materials may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit such
matter or materials. Neither is it the intent or effect of this subsection to legalize the distribution
of obscene matter or materials.
2. Applicability
This subsection applies to all Adult Entertainment Establishments, as defined in Section 9A of
MGL Ch. 40A.
2. Regulations and Standards
No special permit may be granted by the Planning Board for any Adult Entertainment
Establishment unless the following conditions are satisfied:
a. Adult Entertainment Establishments shall not be located less than 300 feet from the nearest
property line of residentially-zoned property nor less than 500 feet from the nearest property
line of:
i. Another Adult Entertainment Establishment
ii. Public or Private Nursery School, Day Care Center, or Kindergarten
iii. Public or Private Elementary Schools or Secondary Schools
iv. Playgrounds
v. Churches or other religious facilities
vi. Library
vii. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of Section 12 of MGL, Ch.138.
b. All building openings, entries and windows shall be screened in such a manner as to prevent
visual access of the public to the interior of the Establishment.
c. All parking areas for Adult Entertainment Establishments shall be in the side or front yards
and shall conform to the requirements of Section VII. of this bylaw. All parking areas shall
be illuminated and all lighting shall be contained on the Establishment's property. The
number of parking spaces required for Adult Entertainment Establishments shall be based on
the nature of the use, and shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Table of
Minimum Parking Requirements for such use.
d. The proposed use and all associated advertising signs shall not be located within fifty (50)
feet of a public or private way and must be set back a minimum of fifty (50) linear feet from
all property lines.
Page 79
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
e. The application for a Special Permit for an Adult Entertainment Establishment under this
subsection must include the following information:
i. Name and address of the legal owner of the Establishment
ii. The number of employees
iii. Proposed security precautions
iv. The physical layout of the premises
v. Nature of the business
f. Signs for adult use establishments must be non-illuminated and otherwise conform to the
requirements of Section VIII. of this bylaw.
g. No special permit shall be issued to any person convicted of violating the provisions of
Section 63 of MGL Ch. 119 or Section 28 of MGL Ch. 272.
G. Wireless Communications Facilities
(Added by 10/20/97 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/10/98)
1. Purpose
The purpose of this subsection is to:
i. Minimize the adverse impacts of wireless communication facilities (hereinafter WCF)
on adjacent properties and residential neighborhoods;
ii. Minimize the overall number and height of such facilities to only what is essential;
iii. Promote shared use of existing facilities to reduce the need for new ones;
iv. Encourage the most appropriate use of the land and to guide sound development while
promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the Town; and
v. Establish districts in which WCFs may be located.
2. Wireless Communication Districts
To achieve the above purpose, this subsection establishes the following Wireless
Communication Districts:
Wireless Communication District A
This overlay district consists of all land located in the Planned Commercial and Limited
Industrial Districts, and the following parcels located in the Rural Residence A and Rural
Residence B Districts, as shown on the official zoning map for the Town of Ipswich: Assessor's
Map 13, Lot 25; and Assessor's Map 51, Lots 5 and 7. Within this district all of the requirements
of the underlying zoning district(s) continue to apply, with the exception of the maximum height

Page 80
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
Within this district all of the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) continue to apply, with
the exception of the maximum height allowance, which is established in paragraph 3. of this section.
The following additional uses shall be allowed: (Amended by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/22/04)
a. Indoor WCFs, allowed as-of-right subject to the dimensional requirements, performance and
design standards of this subsection;
b. Building-mounted and existing freestanding WCFs, allowed subject to Site Plan Review from
the Planning Board and the dimensional requirements, performance and design standards of
this subsection.
3. Dimensional Requirements for WCFs
Freestanding and building-mounted WCFs shall comply with the following dimensional
requirements:
a. Freestanding WCFs shall:
i. Not exceed one hundred twenty (120) feet in height, measured from the base of the tower
to the highest point of the tower or its projections;
ii. Be setback from the property lines of the lot on which it is located by at least one hundred
(100) feet measured from the center of the structure of the WCF base;
iii. Be located a minimum of three hundred (300) feet from the nearest residential building
within a residentially-zoned district; and
iv. Be separated from each other by a minimum of two (2) miles.
Based on a clear display that additional height of the tower or reduced setbacks of the tower
from buildings or property lines will not adversely affect any purpose of this bylaw and will
in fact help to promote the objectives set forth herein, particularly as it relates to co-location,
the Planning Board may, by special permit, allow the height of the of the tower to be
increased, or the required setbacks or separation reduced, up to a maximum of twenty-five
percent (25%).
b. Building-mounted WCFs shall not:
i. Exceed fifteen (15) feet above the rooftop of a supporting building, including any
penthouse, parapet or other similar structure extending above the rooftop;
ii. Exceed fifteen (15) feet above the highest point of a water tower;
iii. Exceed the highest point of a smokestack.
4. Performance Standards/General Requirements
The following performance standards and general requirements shall apply to all WCFs:
a. Compliance with Federal and State Regulations. All WCFs shall be erected, installed,
maintained and used in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and
regulations, including radio frequency emission regulations as set forth in Section 704 of the
1996 Federal Telecommunications Act.
b. Co-location (for the purposes of this subsection, co-location is defined as the mounting or
installation of an antenna on an existing tower, building or structure for the purpose of
transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communication purposes) of WCFs.
WCFs shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of users technologically
practical. Shared use of freestanding, building mounted, or indoor WCFs by commercial
carriers is required unless such shared use is shown to be not technologically practical. The
intent of this requirement is to reduce the number of separate facilities which will require
location within the community. (Amended 10/26/2010 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/24/11)
Page 81
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
All owners and operators of land used in whole or in part for a WCF and all owners and
operators of such WCF shall, as a continuing condition of installing, constructing, erecting
and using a WCF, permit other public utilities or FCC-licensed commercial entities seeking
to operate a WCF to install, erect, mount and use compatible WCF equipment and fixtures
on the equipment mounting structure on reasonable commercial terms; provided, however,
that such co-location does not materially interfere with the transmission and/or reception of
communication signals to or from the existing WCF, and provided that there are no
structural or other physical limitations that make it impractical to accommodate the proposed
additional WCF or fixtures.
c. Removal of Abandoned WCF. Any WCF that is not operational for a continuous period of
twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the WCF shall be removed by the
owner of the WCF, and the site restored to its original condition, within ninety (90) days of
receipt of notice from the Building Inspector notifying the owner of such abandonment.
If such WCF is not removed within ninety (90) days, such WCF shall be deemed to be in
violation of this zoning bylaw and the appropriate enforcement authority may begin
proceedings to enforce and/or cause removal. If there are two or more users of a single
WCF, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the WCF.
5. Design Standards
The following design standards shall apply to all freestanding WCFs, except for paragraph a.,
which shall apply for all exterior WCFs:
a. All exterior WCF equipment and fixtures shall be painted or otherwise screened or colored
to minimize their visibility to occupants or residents of surrounding buildings, streets and
properties. WCF equipment and fixtures visible against a building or structure shall be
colored to blend with such building or structure. WCF equipment and fixtures visible against
the sky or other background shall be colored to minimize visibility against such background.
The maximum amount of vegetation shall be preserved during construction of any WCF.
b. All freestanding WCFs shall be designed to be constructed at the minimum height necessary
to accommodate the anticipated and future use.
c. The only type of freestanding WCFs allowed shall be monopoles, with associated antenna
and/or panels. Whenever technologically feasible, antennas shall be mounted flush against a
pole, provided that such mounting does not compromise the potential for co-location. Lattice
style towers and similar facilities requiring three or more legs and/or guy wires for support
are not allowed.
d. To the extent feasible all network interconnections from any WCF shall be installed
underground, or inside an existing structure.
e. Fencing shall be provided to control access to wireless communications facilities and shall
be compatible with the scenic character of the Town. Fencing shall not be of razor wire.
f. There shall be no signs, except for announcement signs, no trespassing signs and a required
sign giving a phone number where the owner can be reached on a twenty-four (24) hour
basis. All signs shall conform with Section VIII. of this zoning bylaw.
g. Night lighting of freestanding WCFs shall be prohibited unless required by the Federal
Aviation Administration. Lighting shall be limited to that needed for emergencies and/or as
required by the FAA.
h. There shall be a maximum of one (1) parking space for each freestanding WCF, to be used
in connection with the maintenance of the site, and not to be used for the permanent storage
of vehicles or other equipment.
Page 82
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
i. Accessory buildings and/or storage sheds shall be limited to one building per use per tower.
If more than one (1) use, the accessory buildings shall be connected by a common wall. Each
building shall not exceed three hundred (300) square feet in size and ten (10) feet in height,
and shall be of the same design and color.
j. If the proposed freestanding facility is located in a wooded area, a vegetated buffer strip of
undisturbed trees shall be retained for at least fifty (50) feet in width around the entire
perimeter of the proposed facility, except for the access road. The Planning Board may
require surety to cover the cost of remediation if any landscape is damaged during site
clearing. (Added by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
6. Special Permit
a. Application Process
i. All special permit applications for WCFs shall be made and filed on the appropriate
application form. For an application to be considered complete, it shall comply with the
Rules and Regulations Governing Granting of Special Permits, and shall also provide nine
copies of the following information:
a) A color photograph or rendition of the proposed monopole with its antenna and/or
panels. A rendition shall also be prepared providing eight (8) view lines in a one (1)
mile radius from the site, shown beginning at true north and continuing clockwise at
forty-five (45) degree intervals.
b) A description of the monopole and the technical, economic and other reasons for the
proposed location, height and design.
c) Confirmation that the monopole complies with all applicable Federal and State
standards, including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal

e) Written documentation that the applicant has examined all wireless facility sites in
Ipswich and abutting towns within five miles of any boundary of the Town to
determine whether those existing sites can be used to provide adequate coverage
and/or capacity to the Town of Ipswich. [For the purposes of this section, adequate
coverage shall be that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured
median field strength of the transmitted signal is >95dbm. Portions within the area of
adequate coverage may have a signal <95dbm, provided that the signal regains its
strength to >95dbm further away from the base station. Capacity is considered to be
adequate if the grade of service is p.05 or better for at least fifty (50) percent (%) of
the days in a preceding month, prior to the date of application, as measured using
direct traffic measurement of the WCF in question, where the call blocking is due to
frequency contention at the antenna(s)]. The documentation shall include, for each
facility site listed, the exact location (in longitude and latitude), ground elevation,
height of the facility, output frequency, number of channels, power input, and
maximum output per channel. Potential adjustments to these sites, including changes
in antenna type, orientation, gain, and height or power output, shall be specified.

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
The documentation shall also analyze the feasibility of repeaters, in conjunction with
all facility sites in Ipswich and abutting towns, to provide adequate coverage and/or
capacity to the Town of Ipswich. [For purposes of this section, repeaters shall mean
a small receiver/relay transmitter of not more than twenty (20) watts output designed
to provide service to areas which are not able to receive adequate coverage directly
from a base station.] Radial plots of all potential repeaters and/or facility sites, as
they exist and as adjusted, shall also be provided. (Paragraph (e) added by 10/15/01 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
ii. Within fourteen (14) days prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall arrange to locate a
crane, or an alternative temporary structure approved by the Planning Board, at the site in
a manner that replicates the exact height and location of the proposed monopole. The crane
or structure shall remain in position for no less than three (3) consecutive days, for at least
twelve hours per day. The dates and location of the siting shall be advertised in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Town at least fourteen (14) days before the siting,
and notice shall be sent to abutting property owners.
b. Review of Alternative Sites
At the Planning Boards request, the Applicant shall examine alternative sites for the
location of a wireless facility. Said alternative sites may be identified by the Planning Board,
and/or by the Applicant. The purpose of such analysis is to help the Board determine
whether alternative sites to the one proposed in the application better satisfy the
requirements of 6.c.(1) of this Section. (Added by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 2/19/02)
c. Review Criteria (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
In addition to applying the Special Permit general conditions described in Section XI.,
subsection J. of this zoning bylaw, and the standards, requirements, or conditions set forth in
this Section IX.G., the Board shall review the special permit application in accordance with
the following criteria:
i. An applicant proposing a freestanding WCF shall prove to the satisfaction of the Board
that the visual, economic and aesthetic impacts of the facility on the community will be
minimal. The applicant must also demonstrate that the facility needs to be located at the
proposed site due to technical, topographical or other unique circumstances. In
determining whether to issue a special permit, the Board shall consider the following
factors: height of the proposed WCF; the nature of uses adjacent and nearby properties;
surrounding topography; surrounding tree coverage and foliage; the visual impact of the
facility on the abutting neighborhoods and streets and the impact on existing vistas and
natural resources.
ii. No freestanding WCF shall be erected or installed except in compliance with the
provisions of this Section. Any proposed extension in the height, or construction of a
new or replacement of a facility, shall be subject to a new application for a special
permit. The addition of cells, antenna or panels to an existing facility does not require
the issuance of a special permit but is subject to site plan review.
d. Conditions of Approval (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
The following conditions of approval shall apply to all grants of applications for WCFs that
require a Special Permit as indicated by the above Table of Uses in paragraph 2. herein:
i. Annual certification must be provided to the Town's Director of Code Enforcement
which demonstrates continuing compliance with the standards, rules and regulations of
the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission,

conditions must be satisfied:
a) Certificate of insurance for liability coverage in the amounts of one (1) million
dollars must be provided naming the Town as an additional insured.
b) An agreement whereby the user indemnifies and holds the Town harmless against
any claims for injury or damage resulting from or arising out of the use or
occupancy of the Town owned property by the user.
c) A cash bond in a reasonable amount determined and approved by the Board shall be
in force to cover removal of WCF and restoration of site to the condition that the
premises were in at the onset of the lease, when use of said WCF becomes
discontinued or obsolete. The amount is to be payable to the Town in the event that
the user breaches the agreement in Section 5, paragraph c. above.
iii. A maintenance bond shall be posted for the access road, site and monopole in amounts
approved by the Board.
e. Upon receipt of a special permit application, the Planning Board may hire independent
consultants, at the applicants cost, to help it determine whether the application satisfies
paragraph 6.c. (1) of this Section. The applicants signature on the special permit application
shall constitute the applicants agreement to pay such charges. These consultants shall each
be qualified professionals with a record of service to municipalities in one of the following
fields: telecommunications engineering; civil engineering; structural engineering; land use
planning; and/or landscape architecture. The Town of Ipswich reserves all assignable rights
in contract against the applicant, including the right to interest, legal fees, and costs of
collection, in the event that the applicant fails to make timely payment. (Added by 10/15/01 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
In addition to the above, the Board may impose additional conditions as needed to minimize
any adverse impacts of the proposed WCF.

General 2/19/02)
Within thirty days of initial operation of the approved WCF, the Applicant shall pay for an
Independent Consultant hired by the Town to monitor the background levels of Electromagnetic
Frequency Radiation (EMF) emissions from the proposed facility site and/or repeater locations. The
Independent Consultant shall use Monitoring Protocol. A report of monitoring results shall be prepared
by the Independent Consultant and submitted to the Planning Board and the Board of Health.
If the monitoring of the facility site reveals that the site exceeds the FCC 96-326 standard, then
the owners of all facilities using the site shall be so notified. The owner(s) shall submit to the
Planning Board and the Building Inspector a plan for reduction of emissions to a level that
complies with the FCC 96-326 standard within ten business days of notification of noncompliance.
That plan shall reduce emissions to the standard within fifteen (15) days of initial
notification.

however, that
i. Said use shall require a separate special permit from the Planning Board;
ii. Recognizing the unique manner in which each user may conduct its biotechnological
processing, any special permit issued for such a use shall be limited to a specific user
and any change in control of a corporate user shall require a new special permit for a
subsequent user (For the purposes of this subsection, change of control shall be defined
as (a) the sale by the user of its operating assets located on the lot to an unaffiliated
entity; (b) a merger or consolidation resulting in the stockholders of the user owning less
than one-half of the stock of the surviving corporation; or (c) the sale of more than onehalf
of the issued stock of the user to parties who were not stock-holders of the user at
the time of the approval of the special permit);

Commissioners, that said processing use is not detrimental to the health, safety, and
welfare of the community. (Amended by 10/20/08 and 10/17/11 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/28/09 and 2/2/12, respectively)
3. Density Standards
a. Minimum Lot Size: A GEPD may be permitted on a lot which:
i. Has an area of at least sixty (60) acres which has remained substantially unchanged in
lot configuration and size since December 31, 1996, except for a lot from which a
portion of the land has been conveyed to the Town or a qualified conservation
organization for perpetual conservation protection, provided that the remaining
unprotected lot has an area of at least sixty (60) acres. Contiguous lots may be combined
for inclusion in a GEPD, provided that at least one of the lots contains sixty (60) acres
and has remained substantially unchanged in lot configuration and size since December
31, 1996. The calculation of minimum lot size shall be done in accordance with
paragraph b. (3) below; and (Amended by 10/15/12 Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 2/5/13)
ii. Is a great estate as defined in 1. a. above; and
iii. Contains buildings constructed prior to December 31, 1996 which contain in aggregate a
minimum of 40,000 square feet of existing floor area. For the purposes of this
subsection, floor area is defined as the aggregate gross floor area of all floors within all
principal and accessory buildings.
b. Floor Area of Development:
i. New Floor Area: For the purposes of determining the total new floor area which may be
developed on the lot, the applicant may construct new floor area in the development
such that the total resulting floor area does not exceed the product of 3,000 square feet
times the number of dwelling units which could be developed under normal application
of one-acre zoning requirements under the "Town of Ipswich Rules and Regulations
Governing the Subdivision of Land" and in accordance with Section VI. of this zoning
bylaw. The applicant shall provide with the application for special permit a site plan
with verifiable soil tests indicating the number of buildable lots possible under detached
single-family zoning, the State Environmental Code, Title V, the requirements of the
Board of Health, the Wetlands Protection Act, and the Ipswich Wetlands Protection
Bylaw and Rules and Regulations. Such soil tests shall be conducted as if they were
actually percolation tests in accordance with the above-referenced requirements and
shall be verified and attested to by a registered professional engineer.
ii. Additional Floor Space for Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings: A GEPD that
rehabilitates or renovates all buildings and supporting structures certified by the
Historical Commission as having historic or architectural significance may increase
allowable floor space by the amount of square footage contained in all existing buildings
that are rehabilitated or renovated as part of the GEPD development, except that new
floor area developed on the lot may be increased by five (5) square feet for every square
foot of floor space contained in buildings and supporting structures certified by the
Historical Commission as having historic or architectural significance that are
rehabilitated or renovated. The Planning Board may, by special permit, allow relief of
the requirement to renovate all of the buildings certified by the Historical Commission
as having historic or architectural significance in exchange for the density bonus,
without loss of any related bonus square footage for other renovated buildings, except
for any bonus square footage associated with the building for which relief is being
sought, under the following conditions: (1) Not more than one certified building within a
GEPD shall be granted relief from the requirement, and in no instance shall the building
be the great estate mansion; (2) Prior to the issuance of the initial GEPD special permit,
the building in question shall have been vacant, uninhabitable, and in need of substantial
renovation; (3)The Planning Board must determine that the cost of renovating the
Page 88
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
subject building is so high as to render its renovation financially infeasible; (4) Materials
from the building shall be reused in the renovation or rehabilitation of another certified
building within the GEPD, and any remaining materials shall be made available at no
cost to the Historical Commission before any material disposal may take place; (5)
Photo documentation of the building is provided to the Historical Commission, in
accordance with their requirements, prior to its demolition; (6) The Historical
Commission must provide the Planning Board its written assent to the buildings
demolition; (7) No additional floor space shall be derived from the square footage of the
building that is demolished; (8) In lieu of the buildings preservation, the Planning Board
may require the GEPD owner to contribute funds for the purpose of furthering the
preservation of historic buildings and/or structures elsewhere in Town. The Planning
Board shall refer to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings for guidance when reviewing the
buildings which have been, or are proposed to be, rehabilitated or renovated. If the
Planning Board determines that the reconstruction or replacement of an existing building
that has not been certified by the Historical Commission as having historic or
architectural significance is more consistent with IX.H.1. than the buildings
rehabilitation or renovation, then the Applicant may increase allowable floor space by
the amount of square footage contained in all existing buildings that is replaced or
reconstructed. (Amended by 10/20/03 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/22/04) (Amended by
10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05; amended by 10/17/11 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 2/2/12)
iii. Wetlands/Coastal Exclusion: For a lot which contains wetlands and/or floodplain, or
which is subject to the Rivers Protection Act, only one-half the area which is designated
as wetlands and/or floodplain, or is subject to the Rivers Protection Act, may be
considered in the lot area calculations. For the purposes of determining lot area, the
Federal Insurance Floodplain Maps (FIRM) and the Town of Ipswich General Wetlands
Bylaws shall be used to determine floodplain, wetlands, and areas subject to the Rivers
Protection Act.
iv. Maximum Density: The total allowable floor area obtained through the application of
the formulae described in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above, shall not exceed eight
percent (8%) of the area of the lot.
4. Building Design Standards
When constructing or renovating buildings in a GEPD, the Applicant is encouraged to make the
buildings as energy efficient and eco-friendly as possible. Guidelines for green building
construction are available from the Town Department of Planning & Development. Applicants
are also encouraged to choose building designs and materials that are attractive and which
complement the natural landscape. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by AG 1/27/05)
5. Development Requirements
a. Town Water: The development shall be served by a water system deemed adequate for fire
protection and domestic use by the Water Commissioners and by the Fire Chief.
b. Sanitary Sewer/Septic: The development shall be served by the Town's sanitary sewer
system or by one or more on-site disposal systems conforming to the State Environmental
Code, Title V and the regulations of the Board of Health. If, however, in the judgment of the
Board, the topography and/or soil conditions are such that it would be more efficient to
allow (1) a private central sanitary sewer system, notwithstanding the lot's location in a
Water Supply District, and/or (2) allow an underground common septic system or individual
septic systems to be placed in the preserved open space, this configuration may be permitted.
Prior to making such judgment, the Planning Board shall seek the review and
recommendations of the Board of Health, Department of Utilities, Board of Water
Commissioners, and the Conservation Commission. If a GEPD is located within a Water
Supply District and a private central sanitary sewer system is proposed, the Planning Board
shall not approve a special permit under this subsection unless and until said system shall
Page 89
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
have received a favorable recommendation from the Board of Water Commissioners, which
recommendation shall not be unreasonably withheld. All systems are further subject to
approval by the Board of Health and any other governmental authority having jurisdiction.
c. Open Space Restriction: A minimum of forty percent (40%) of the lot shall either be:
(Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
i. Conveyed to the Town of Ipswich and accepted by it for open space use;
ii. Conveyed to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of a state forest, park, or
wildlife management area;
iii. Conveyed to a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation
of open space, and made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance
with the provisions of Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of Chapter 184 of the General Laws
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
iv. Made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of Chapter 184 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts running in favor of either the Town or, upon the approval of the
Planning Board, a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the
conservation of open space. The conservation restriction shall provide that such land
shall be kept, in perpetuity, in an open or natural state, in accordance with the
above-noted sections of Chapter 184 of the General Laws.
In designating the open space, the applicant shall apply the guidelines adopted by the
Planning Board in May of 1997, entitled CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING PROPOSED
OPEN SPACE. At least a portion of the open space shall be available for use by the general
public, unless the applicant can provide compelling reasons to the Planning Board why such
access would be infeasible. If it is deemed necessary to achieve the purposes of this
subsection, the Planning Board may increase the open space minimum requirement by not
more than ten percent (10%).
d. Dimensional Regulations
i. A minimum setback of one hundred (100) feet shall be provided between a GEPD and
abutting lots, and a buffer strip consisting of vegetated area with a minimum depth of
one hundred (100) feet shall be provided between the GEPD and any street line. An
entry drive, along with a gate house and appropriate signage, may be permitted within
the buffer strip. If a boundary line of the GEPD is adjacent to permanent open space,
such as Town, State, Federal or privately-restricted open space, the Planning Board may
require that the first thirty (30) feet of the setback from such open space be a landscaped
buffer. The Planning Board may decrease or increase by not more than twenty percent
(20%) any buffer area requirement if, after site plan review by the Board, the Board
deems such action to be reasonable and appropriate.
ii. The area developed for commercial use, including buildings, parking, outdoor
recreational structures, and areas paved for vehicular use, shall not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the total area of the lot. Walking or bicycle trails shall not be counted
in the calculation of the twenty percent (20%) limitation.
iii. The development shall be subject to site plan review in accordance with the provisions
of Section X.
iv. Newly constructed or renovated buildings in a GEPD may be four (4) stories in height,
provided that the building height does not exceed the maximum height allowed under
Section VI. G. 2. of this bylaw.
Page 90
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
v. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this zoning bylaw, in granting a
special permit and site plan approval for a GEPD, the Planning Board may reduce any of
the foregoing dimensional requirements, or increase the height requirement, to a
maximum of twenty-five percent (25%), provided that in no instance shall a building
contain more than four stories.
vi. Newly constructed buildings in a GEPD, other than gatehouses, shall be setback at least
two hundred fifty (250) feet from a public way.
e. Streets and Further Subdivision: Any subdivision of the GEPD which is subject to MGL
C.41 shall be in accordance with the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of
Land in the Town of Ipswich. After issuance of a GEPD special permit and site plan
approval, and establishment of the required open space for the GEPD, as a whole, the GEPD
may be subdivided into lots which may be less than sixty (60) acres and may be held in
separate ownership, provided that each portion of the subdivided site remains subject to all
of the applicable terms and conditions of: (1) the GEPD special permit, and (2) the site plan
approval for the improvements on such portion of the site.
f. Phasing: Phasing of the GEPD, as approved by the Planning Board, shall be permitted either
pursuant to phasing described in the initial special permit application or in subsequent
special permit or site plan review applications. The special permit and site plan approval
shall not be deemed to have lapsed so long as the applicant shall have commenced use of the
Great Estate Preservation special permit or site plan approval in substantial accordance with
the phasing time frames set forth in the special permit and site plan approval application.
The Planning Board shall have the authority to require a performance bond or other similar
mechanism if it determines that such a mechanism is necessary to ensure that the key
components of the project are satisfactorily completed.
6. Special Permit Application Process
All special permit applications for GEPD shall be made and filed on the appropriate application
form. For an application to be considered complete, it shall provide all information required by
the Rules and Regulations Governing Granting of Special Permits, available from the
Department of Planning and Development, and by any regulations adopted in accordance with
paragraph 9 below.
The special permit application shall also be accompanied by a certification from the Historical
Commission of all historically and/or architecturally significant buildings, landscape features
and supporting structures located on the site, said certification to be based on the criteria set forth
in Chapter XVI. of the General Bylaws of the Town of Ipswich; and by nine copies of a site
development report, which shall summarize how the proposed GEPD satisfies the special permit
criteria being considered by the Planning Board. The site development report should include, at
minimum, an inventory of natural resource features, wildlife and their habitat; an inventory of
the Great Estate consistent with current standards required for documentation for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places, and a general inventory of all other existing buildings,

7. Review Criteria
In addition to applying the special permit general conditions described in Section XI., subsection
J., of this zoning bylaw, and the standards, requirements, or conditions set forth in this Section
IX. I., the Board shall review the special permit application in accordance with the following
criterion: the proposed GEPD will, by its design and layout, succeed in: (a) preserving open
space for conservation and/or recreation purposes, and providing appropriate public access to the
open space; (b) protecting natural features of the land which are important to the character of the
town; and (c) preserving the buildings, structures, and landscape features of the large estate
properties in the RRA District.
8. Preliminary Review
Prior to submitting a special permit application to the Planning Board for a GEPD, the applicant
is strongly encouraged to submit a preliminary concept plan for review by the Planning Board
and a Development Review Committee appointed by the Town Manager. The preliminary
review shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to identify early in the process the
preferences of the Planning Board and Review Committee relative to the development of the
site. The Review Committee shall include the chairs of the Conservation Commission, Open
Space Committee, Bay Circuit Trail Committee, and Historical Commission, or their designees;
the Directors of the Town Departments of Utilities, Code Enforcement, Public Works, Public
Safety, and Planning & Development; a professional architect; a professional landscape
architect; a professional civil engineer, and one or more residents from the neighborhood in
which the GEPD is proposed.
The preliminary concept plan should show: (a) the location, height, density, and architectural
treatment of all buildings proposed for construction or renovation; (b) the size, location and
proposed use of the open space; (c) the location of all existing and proposed parking areas and
access roads within and without the GEPD; (d) the type and probable location of the proposed
utilities; and (e) a delineation of any wetlands or other environmentally-sensitive land on the
property. The preliminary concept plan should be accompanied by a certification from the
Historical Commission of all historically and/or architecturally significant buildings, landscape
features and supporting structures located on the site, said certification to be based on the criteria
set forth in Chapter XVI. of the General Bylaws of the Town of Ipswich.
9. Advisory Opinion
Within ten (10) days of receipt of a special permit application for a GEPD, the Planning Board
shall transmit copies of the application to the aforementioned Development Review Committee
and the Historical Commission, which shall review the application and submit their
recommendations to the Planning Board within forty-five (45) days of the referral of the
application.
10. Adoption of Rules and Regulations:
The Board shall adopt an application form and rules and regulations in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection. Said rules and regulations shall specify the application process,
type and number of required plans, and general requirements in order to assist the developer in
complying with the intent of this subsection.
I. Inclusionary Housing Requirements
(Added by 10/27/97 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/10/98)
1. Purpose and Intent
The requirements of this subsection are established for the purpose of:
a. Increasing the supply of housing in the Town of Ipswich that is permanently available to and
affordable by low and moderate-income households;
b. Encouraging a greater diversity of housing accommodations to meet the needs of families
and other Ipswich residents; and
Page 92
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
c. Developing and maintaining a satisfactory proportion of the Towns housing stock as
affordable units.
2. Applicability (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
The requirements of this subsection I. apply to:
a. Any multi-family residential development subject to approval by special permit; and
b. Any proposed residential development in the RRA, RRB, and RRC Districts that would
create two or more buildable lots pursuant to the Table of Dimensional and Density
Regulations (Section VI.). Developments that create only one (1) single-family buildable lot
are exempt from the provisions of subsection I.3.c. if the minimum lot sizes of the new lot
and the remaining parcel are 43,560 square feet each. Developments that create a new parcel
that is at least three acres, where the remaining lot is at least one (1) acre, are also exempt for
the provisions of subsection I.3.c. In exchange for an exemption from the requirements of
this subsection, the Applicant must record a restriction at the Essex South Registry of Deeds
prohibiting the creation of additional buildable lots on the property having a lot size of less
than two (2) acres. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05) (Amended by
10/16/06 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/4/07) (Amended by 10/15/12 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 2/5/13) (Amended by 10/15/13 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/13/14)
3. Requirements (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
a. Multi-family Residential Development
i. Ten percent of the units in any multi-family residential development of ten units or more
(the Affordable Housing Units) requiring a special permit shall be sold or rented to
households with incomes at or below eighty percent (80%) for for-sale housing and sixty
percent (60%) for rental housing of the Median Regional Household Income (as
determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
pursuant to the Housing Act of 1937, as amended and adjusted for family size), and shall
be restricted to sales prices or monthly rents that are affordable to such households. The
sales price or monthly rent shall be such that the dwelling unit qualifies as a local
initiative unit under the Commonwealths Local Initiative Program (LIP) and meets the
requirements of a subsidized housing unit for the purposes of listing in the Towns
subsidized housing inventory under G.L.C. 40B Sec. 20-23. For purposes of this bylaw,
rental housing shall be deemed affordable if rents (including utilities or a HUD-approved
utility allowance if utilities are paid separately by tenants) do not exceed thirty percent
(30%) of fifty percent (50%) of the gross monthly Median Regional Household Income
for a family of four, adjusted for the bedroom size of the unit in accordance with the
protocols accepted under Section 42 of the federal tax code. For-sale housing shall be
deemed affordable for purposes of this bylaw if it is priced so that monthly principal,
interest, tax, and property insurance costs and condominium fees (if applicable) do not
exceed thirty percent (30%) of seventy percent (70%) of gross monthly Median Regional
Household Income for a family of four (4), adjusted for the bedroom size of the unit,
using the best generally available mortgage terms and rates for such borrowers. Where
the application of this formula results in a fractional housing unit, a fraction of one half
(1/2) of a dwelling unit or more shall be considered as one (1) Affordable Housing Unit;
if the fraction is less than one-half (1/2) of a dwelling unit, each tenth of the fraction shall
require the payment of the unit fee specified in (ii) below. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05) (Amended by 10/16/06 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/4/07)
ii. For multi-family residential developments of fewer than ten (10) units requiring a
special permit, the applicant shall, in consideration of such permit, provide either one (1)
Affordable Housing Unit in accordance with 3. a. (i), 4., 5., and 6. of this Section I., or
pay a fee to the Town to provide affordable housing in Ipswich. The fee shall be
calculated on a pro rata basis, and for developments of fewer than ten dwelling units, the
fee shall be $10,000 per rental unit and between $10,000 and $25,000 per ownership
Page 93
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
unit, based on the formula in the Planning Board Regulation: Inclusionary Housing
Payment-in-Lieu-of Option, adopted on June 19, 2008, as amended. The fee may be
adjusted by the Planning Board from time to time through the issuance of guidelines or
regulations. Such adjustments shall reflect both changes in the median contract price for
newly constructed homes in the Northeast U.S., as reported annually by the U.S. Census
Bureau, and changes in the maximum sales price for single-family homes developed for
sale to households at or below eighty percent (80%) of Median Regional Household
Income through programs administered by the Massachusetts Department of Housing
and Community Development. (Amended 11/7/17 by STM; approved by AG 2/26/18)
b. Single-Family Developments
Applicants developing single-family detached or attached dwelling units in the RRA and
RRB Districts and seeking to obtain the density bonus described in footnote 26 to the Table
of Dimensional and Density Regulations in Section VI. of this bylaw shall comply with the
following requirements:
i. Provide an Affordable Housing Unit in accordance with 3.a.(i), 4., 5., and 6. of this
Section I.; or provide an affordable housing fee in accordance with 3.a.(ii) of this
Section I.; and
ii. Obtain an Open Space Preservation Zoning special permit in accordance with the
provisions of Section IX.A. of this bylaw, unless the development creates fewer than
five total dwelling units. (Amended 11/7/17 by STM; approved by AG 2/26/18)
c. Subdivision Approval
Any development application submitted under the provisions of this subsection that involves
the subdivision of land shall also be subject to the approval of the Planning Board under the
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich.
4. Conditions of Approval (Amended by 10/15/01 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/19/02)
a. Continued Affordability
Affordable housing units developed pursuant to this bylaw shall be subject to long-term use
restrictions and, where applicable, resale restrictions, to ensure that they remain affordable to
low- and moderate-income households for the longest period allowed by law, but in no
instance less than ninety-nine (99) years. Such restrictions shall be enforceable by the Town
of Ipswich or by a housing-related charitable corporation or trust designed by the Town of
Ipswich in accordance with Sections 31 and 32 of Chapter 184 of the Massachusetts General
Laws, and shall be executed and recorded at the Essex County Registry of Deeds, Southern
District. It is the intent of this bylaw that affordable housing units be restricted and that longterm
affordability be enforced in such a manner that affordable units are considered "low and
moderate income housing" for purposes of Section 20 of Chapter 40B of the Massachusetts
General Laws. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05)
b. Comparability
Affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the site and shall be indistinguishable from
market-rate units except in size, interior finish, fixtures and appliances.
c. Family Units
Except as otherwise provided by the Planning Board, affordable units shall contain a
minimum of two (2) bedrooms and shall be in every way suitable for family occupancy.
Page 94
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
d. Alternative Requirements
The Planning Board may:
i. Reduce the required percentage of affordable housing units from ten percent to not less
than five percent of the units permitted if such Affordable Housing Units are sold or
rented at prices affordable to households at or below fifty percent (50%) of the Median
Regional Household Income;
ii. Increase the required percentage of affordable housing units from ten percent to not
more than fifteen percent of the permitted units if it determines that federal, state or local
subsidies are available to defray the cost to the applicant of providing any affordable
units in excess of ten percent; (Added by 10/15/01 STM; approved by AG 2/19/02)
iii. Find that a sales price or monthly rent for a dwelling unit is affordable pursuant to 3.a.(i)
above, despite not fully meeting the requirements of this subsection, in the following
two instances: i) the dwelling unit does not satisfy the fair market requirement for listing
in the Towns subsidized housing inventory, but the Planning Board determines in said
instance that meeting the requirement would result in an adverse impact to an existing
income-eligible tenant; and ii) the dwelling unit does not strictly comply with the stated
eligibility requirements, based on a determination that current local market conditions
make it impractical to satisfy it, and provided that in no instance shall eligible
households be required to earn less than fifty percent (50%) or allowed to earn more
than eighty percent (80%) of the Regional Median Household Income; and (Added by
10/15/12 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/5/13)
iv. Allow Assisted Living Facilities of ten units or more to satisfy some or all of the
requirement to provide ten percent of the units as affordable as defined in 3.a.(i) above,
through a payment-in-lieu in an amount deemed sufficient by the Planning Board,
provided that the Applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate that it is infeasible to meet the
requirement as written, and provided that the Planning Board determines, after
consultation with the Ipswich Affordable Housing Partnership, that such payments are
likely to materially advance the Towns ability to fund programs which assist with the
housing needs of income-eligible individuals sixty-five (65) years of age or older.
Should the Planning Board allow payment-in-lieu pursuant to this paragraph (4), it shall
advise the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board of its preference that the funds, to the
greatest extent possible, benefit income-eligible individuals sixty-five (65) years of age
or older; (Added by 10/15/12 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/5/13)
v. For commercial units that were initially used for residential purposes that the owner
seeks to re-establish as dwelling units, the Board may either partially or fully exempt the
dwelling unit from the requirements of paragraph 3.a.(ii) of this Section I. (Added by 10/21/14
Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/4/15)
Prior to imposing any of the alternative requirements listed in this paragraph 4.d, the Planning
Board shall consult with the Ipswich Affordable Housing Partnership. (Added by 10/15/12 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 2/5/13)
5. Off-site Location
With the approval of the Planning Board, the inclusionary housing requirement may be met
through the provision of some or all of the required affordable units on an alternative site or sites
suitable for housing use. Affordable off-site units shall be newly created and at least equal in
number to the affordable units that would have been provided on-site. Affordable off-site units
required by this Section may be located in an existing structure, provided that they do not replace
any of the dwelling units contained in the structures. Affordable units provided through this
provision shall comply, in all respects other than on-site location, with the requirements of this
section and all other requirements of the zoning bylaw. (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved
by Attorney General 1/27/05)
Page 95
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
6. Compliance
a. Permit Conditions
No special permit shall be issued without appropriate restrictions to ensure that the
provisions of this subsection are made binding upon the applicant.
b. Occupancy Conditions
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any market-rate units in a development
covered by this subsection until all deed covenants and/or other documents necessary to
ensure compliance by the applicant with the requirements of this subsection have been
executed.
J. Accessory Apartment
1. Purpose and Intent:
The intent of this subsection is to allow accessory apartments in owner-occupied single-family
dwellings. Its purpose is to:
a. Add moderately-priced rental units to the housing stock to meet the needs of small
households, both young and old;
b. Make housing units available to moderate-income households who might otherwise have
difficulty finding housing in the town;
c. Provide older homeowners with a means of obtaining rental income, companionship,
security and services, and thereby to enable them to stay more comfortably in homes and
neighborhoods they might otherwise be forced to leave.
(Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/27/05) (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08)
2. Accessory Apartments by Special Permit
The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a Special Permit for the alteration of a single family
dwelling, whether existing or newly constructed, to include an accessory apartment in any
residential district, subject to the following provisions:
a. The apartment will be a complete, separate housekeeping unit that functions as a
separate unit from the principal dwelling. No more than one (1) accessory apartment
is allowed within one (1) single family dwelling per lot.
b. The accessory apartment shall not contain more than one (1) bedroom and one (1)
bathroom, nor shall it exceed 900 S.F. of floor area. (Amended by 10/16/18 Special Town
Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/19)

commercial purpose or activity, regardless of other provisions of this bylaw.
f. At least one parking space is available for use by occupants of the Apartment.
g. In the RRA, RRB and RRC Districts, accessory apartments shall not be allowed in
single-family dwellings located on lots that are nonconforming for lack of required
lot area, unless said lot is at least 10,000 square feet in size. Accessory apartments
shall also not be allowed in single-family dwellings located on lots developed under
Section IX.A. (OSPZ) of the zoning bylaw, unless the lot is at least 10,000 square
feet in size. (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/08) (Amended
by 10/16/18 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/23/19)
h. The sanitary disposal system for the accessory apartment and principal structure shall
comply with the applicable Ipswich Board of Health and Title V regulations, provided that,
Page 96
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
compliance of the sanitary disposal system shall not require the application of Subpart E of
310 CMR 15.00, or shall be served by Town sewer. (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 2/16/10)
i. Utilities such as water, electric, and gas necessary for the accessory apartment shall be
extensions of the existing utilities serving the principal single-family dwelling. No new
utility services or meters shall be installed for the use of the accessory apartment. (Amended by
10/20/08 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/28/09)
j. The Special Permit shall be issued to the record owner of the lot and shall specify that the
owner must occupy either the single family home or the accessory apartment.
k. The Special Permit shall be recorded at the Registry of Deeds against the title of the record
owner of the lot. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant must submit proof
of the recording of the special permit. (Amended by 10/16/06 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney
General 1/4/07)
l. Prior to the issuance of a permit, the owner(s) must notify the Building Inspector in writing
that the owner will occupy one of the dwelling units on the premises as the owners
permanent/primary residence, except for bona fide temporary absences.
m. When a structure which has received a Permit for an accessory apartment is sold, the new
owner(s), if they wish to continue to exercise the Permit, must within thirty (30) day of the
sale, submit a sworn and notarized written statement to the Building Inspector stating that
they will occupy either the principal dwelling or the accessory apartment on the premises as
their primary year-round residence or their sole seasonal residence. This statement shall be
listed as a condition on any permits that are issued under this Section. (Amended by 10/20/08 Special
Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/28/09)
n. The creation of an accessory apartment must be done so that the accessory apartment either
shares a common floor-ceiling assembly with the principal dwelling or a common wall
connector, which connect enclosed interior space. For purposes of this section the common
floor-ceiling assembly requirement shall be met when the units share at least 500 square feet
of common floor-ceiling assembly. The common wall connector requirements shall be met
when the units share at least 12 feet of common wall. (Amended by 10/16/18 Special Town Meeting;
approved by Attorney General 1/23/19)
(Section J added by 4/5/99 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 8/2/99) (Amended by 10/18/04 Special Town Meeting; approved

K. Design Review
(Added by 10/17/05 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/12/05)
1. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to preserve and enhance the Town's cultural, economic and
historical resources by providing for a detailed review of certain changes in land use, the
appearance of structures and the appearance of sites which may affect these resources.
The review procedures are intended to:
a. Enhance the social and economic viability of the Town by preserving property values and
promoting the attractiveness of the Town as a place to live, visit and shop;
b. Encourage the conservation of buildings and groups of buildings that have aesthetic or
historic significance;
c. Discourage construction that is incompatible with the existing environment; and
d. Encourage creativity and variety in future development.
2. Applicability and Authority
Design Review in accordance with this section shall be required for:
a. Any community facility, commercial, industrial or business buildings which require site plan
review or special permit approval;
b. New construction, exterior alteration, or expansion of buildings associated with a special
permit application for a Great Estates Preservation Development; and
c. Any special permit application for a multi-family dwelling or multi-family development.
3. Design Review Board
In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws, a Design
Review Board is hereby established. The Design Review Board shall review applications for all
actions that are subject to the provisions of this section and shall make recommendations to the
appropriate permit granting authority concerning the conformance of the proposed action to the
design review standards contained herein. The Design Review Board shall consist of five
members, with the following qualifications, if possible: two registered architects, landscape
architects or persons with equivalent professional training; one resident who is either a business
or commercial property owner/operator, or is a member of an organization representing Ipswich
business owners; and one residential property owner. Appointments to the Design Review Board
shall be made as follows:
a. Two members shall be appointed by the Planning Board;
b. One member shall be appointed by the Historical Commission;
c. Four members shall be appointed by the Board of Selectmen, two of whom shall be
alternates.
The terms of all members and alternate members of the Design Review Board shall be three
years, except that when the Board is originally established, members shall be appointed as
follows: the Planning Board shall appoint one member to a one-year term and one member to a
two-year term; the Selectmen shall appoint one member for a two-year term and one member for
a three-year term, and the Historical Commission shall appoint one member for a three-year term.
The term of the alternates appointed by the Board of Selectmen shall be one and two years when
the Board is originally established.
4. Procedures
Applications for all actions subject to review by the Design Review Board shall be made by
submitting a complete application form along with the required application materials to the
Planning Department, where forms may be obtained. The application shall be submitted either
simultaneously with, or prior to, the submittal of the associated site plan review or special permit
application.
Page 98
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
a. Submittal: The applicant shall be responsible for submitting the following materials and
documentation at the time of application:
i. Completed Design Review Board application;
ii. Color photographs showing existing buildings and site conditions on and adjacent to the
proposed project area;
iii. Building elevations showing the proposed configuration, building materials and colors,
and adjacent site/building conditions;
iv. Plans showing the footprint and relationships of structures, including relationship to
structures on contiguous lots, exterior circulation and points of entry;
v. Full lot and building section, including relationship of building height and street width;
vi. Other plans, including landscaping, renderings, models, and detailed drawings which may
be necessary to demonstrate what design attributes are being addressed.
Plans shall be to scale and no smaller than fifty (50) feet to the inch. The Design Review
Board may waive any and all of the requirements for design submittal and review.
b. Time for Review: Upon receipt of an application for design review, the Design Review
Board shall meet with the applicant within twenty-one (21) days. The Design Review Board
shall transmit its recommendations in writing to the applicant and the Planning Board within
thirty-five (35) days of receipt of the application. Failure by the Design Review Board to
make and transmit its recommendation within the thirty-five (35) day period allocated shall
be considered a recommendation for approval of the application as submitted, unless the
applicant was granted an extension in a public meeting or in writing. Applicants are strongly
encouraged to request a preliminary consultation with the Design Review Board prior to
submission of a formal application for design review. The purpose of a preliminary meeting
is to discuss design alternatives during the early planning stages. Such a request may be
made by submitting one or two preliminary design alternatives in rough sketch form to the
Planning Office, which shall immediately transmit them to the Design Review Board. The
Design Review Board shall meet with those requesting preliminary consultations within
twenty-one (21) days of receipt of a written request.
c. Exemption: No design review shall be required in those instances where the Design Review
Board determines that specific actions subject to paragraph 2. above do not constitute
substantial alterations to the form or appearance of a building or site, and where no new or
additional requirements of the zoning bylaw must be met for the proposed action.
d. Recommendation: If the special permit granting authority elects to disregard the
recommendation of the DRB, it shall explain its rationale for taking such action in its
decision and/or minutes.
5. Design Review Principles and Standards
The design review principles and standards described in this section are intended to guide the
applicant in the development of site and building design and the Design Review Board in its
review of proposed actions. These principles and standards shall not be regarded as inflexible
requirements and they are not intended to discourage creativity, invention or innovation.
Compatibility as used below does not demand conformity or homogeneity. The Design Review
Board is specifically precluded from mandating any official aesthetic style for Ipswich or for
imposing the style of any particular historical period. The design review principles and standards
shall apply to all actions reviewable under paragraph 2. above.
a. Standards: When reviewing an application, the Design Review Board shall consider the
guidance of the Town Character Statement, as well as the following standards:
Page 99
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
i. Height  The height of any proposed alteration should be compatible with the style
and character of the building, structure or site being altered and that of the surroundings.
ii. Proportions  The proportions and relationships of height to width between
windows, doors, signs and other architectural elements should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the building or structure and that of the surroundings.
iii. Relation of Structures and Spaces  The relation of a structure to the open space
between it and adjoining structures should be compatible with such relations in the
surroundings.
iv. Shape  The shape of roofs, windows, doors and other design elements should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of a building or site and that of its
surroundings.
v. Landscape  Any proposed landscape development or alteration should be
compatible with the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Landscape and
streetscape elements, including topography, plantings and paving patterns, should provide
continuity and definition to the street, pedestrian areas and surrounding landscape.
vi. Scale  The scale of a structure or landscape alteration should be compatible with its
architectural or landscape design style and character and that of the surroundings. The
scale of ground-level design elements such as building entryways, windows, porches,
plaza, parks, pedestrian furniture, plantings and other street and site elements should be
determined by and directed toward the use, comprehension and enjoyment of pedestrians.
vii. Directional Expression  Building facades and other architectural and landscape
design elements should be compatible with those of others in the surrounding area with
regard to the dominant vertical or horizontal expression or direction related to use and
historical or cultural character, as appropriate.
viii. Architectural and Site Details - Architectural and site details including signs,
lighting, pedestrian furniture, planting and paving, along with materials, colors, textures
and grade should be treated so as to be compatible with the original architectural and
landscape design style of the structure or site and to preserve and enhance the character of
the surrounding area. In the downtown business districts, these details should blend with
their surroundings to create a diverse, functional and unified streetscape.
ix. Signs - The design of signs should reflect the scale and character of the structure or site.
Signs should simply and clearly identify individual establishments, buildings, locations
and uses, while remaining subordinate to the architecture and larger streetscape. The
choice of materials, color, size, method of illumination and character of symbolic
representation on signs should be compatible with the architectural or landscape design
style of the structure or site.
x. Garages and Accessory Buildings  Garages and accessory buildings should be sensitively
integrated into the overall development, and should not be the predominant design feature
when viewed from the street.
In addition to the design review standards described above, the Design Review Board shall
develop additional guidelines providing further detail and illustration of these design review
standards. The guidelines, when developed, will be made available to the public upon request
from the Planning Office.
6. Rules and Regulations
The Design Review Board shall promulgate and publish such Rules and Regulations as are
deemed appropriate and consistent with the provisions of this bylaw.

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
L. Home Occupations
(Added by 10/17/05 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 12/12/05)
1. Purpose
The conduct of home occupations may be permitted under the provisions of this section. It is the
intent of this section to allow home occupations which are and will continue to be clearly
incidental and secondary to the principal use of the dwelling unit or the permitted accessory
structure. The essential component of a home occupation is that it does not detract from the
character of the existing land use.
2. General Standards
Home occupations are permitted only if they conform to the following conditions:
a. The home occupation shall be carried out only inside the principal dwelling, with the
exception of yards used in conjunction with a family day care, and except as described in 3.
below.
b. Except for a family day care, no more than twenty percent (20%) of the floor area of the
residence shall be used for the purpose of the home occupation.
c. Not more than one (1) person not a member of the household shall be engaged in the home
occupation.
d. There shall be no exterior display, no exterior storage of materials, and no other exterior

Boards determination of compliance with this standard, the Applicant shall be required to
submit an analysis, prepared by a qualified engineer that demonstrates compliance with these
noise standards, as well as consistency with Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection guidance for noise measurement, unless the Planning Board finds the
manufacturers data on noise sufficient to make this determination.
e. Electromagnetic Interference with radio frequency communication, traceable to the
operation or location of WECS, shall be limited in accordance with all applicable sections of
the Federal Communications Commission specifications.
f. WECS shall be inspected and serviced annually according to the manufacturers
maintenance manual and will be considered abandoned if not properly maintained for a
period of one year or if designated a safety hazard by the Building Inspector.
g. WECS shall be painted a non-reflective color designed to blend with the surrounding
environment.
h. All wires associated with WECS shall be located underground.
5. Submission Requirements
a. A plan indicating the proposed location of the proposed WECS, existing and proposed
structures, aboveground utility lines and any other significant features or appurtenances;

suitable and that the size, height and design are the minimum necessary for that purpose.
b. The Planning Board shall also impose, in addition to any applicable conditions specified in
this section, such conditions as it finds reasonably appropriate to safeguard the neighborhood
or otherwise serve the purposes of this section, including, but not limited to: screening,
lighting, fences, modification of the exterior appearance of the structures, limitation upon
size, method of access or traffic features, parking, removal upon cessation of use or other
requirements. Such conditions shall be imposed in writing and the applicant may be required
to post bond or other surety for compliance with said conditions in an amount satisfactory to
the Planning Board.
c. The Planning Board may require the proponent to provide or pay for professional services to
evaluate the proposal to determine the flexibility of geographic location, to analyze the
loading capacities of the proposed structures, and to review camouflage and screening
techniques.
d. The granting of a special permit for a commercial or municipal WECS shall be conditional
upon a finding by the Planning Board that the proposal is in the public interest and provides
substantial benefit to the community, and the burden of proof shall rest with the Applicant.
e. Before it may approve the installation of a WECS, the Planning Board shall make a finding
of fact that the locations of the facilities do not substantially adversely affect the surrounding

O. Green Space Preservation Development District
(Added by 10/20/08 STM; approved by AG 1/28/09) (Amended by 10/19/09 STM; approved by Attorney General 2/16/10)
1. Purpose
The purpose of this subsection is to:
a. Expand the Towns economic base by providing opportunities for appropriately sited and
designed non-residential uses;
b. Encourage the preservation and appropriate development of certain large properties in the
RRA and RRC District;
c. Encourage the efficient use of such land in harmony with the natural features of the RRA
and RRC District;
d. Protect the rural character and vistas of the Towns roads, especially its main corridors;
e. Provide an alternative to the subdivision of a large tract for residences;
f. Preserve open space for conservation or recreation use; and
g. Protect natural features which are important to the character of the town.
2. Green Space Preservation Development District
To achieve the above purpose, this subsection establishes the Green Space Preservation Development
District (GSPDD). The GSPDD is an overlay district, superimposed on the following parcels located
in the Rural Residence A and Rural Residence C Districts, as shown on the official zoning map for
the Town of Ipswich: Assessors Map 20B, Lot 30A; Assessors Map 20B, Lot 31; and Assessors
Map 21, Lot 28. Within this district all of the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s)
continue to apply. The following uses shall be allowed by special permit and site plan approval from
the Planning Board, subject to the standards described in subsections 3 through 9:
a. Miscellaneous professional and business offices and services;
b. Research offices or establishments devoted to research and development activities;
c. The processing of products arising out of, or substantially similar to, the research and development
activities of a research office or establishment on the same lot; provided, however, that the Board
determines, upon consultation with the Board of Health and the Water Commissioners, that said
processing use is not detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the community.
3. Density Standards
a. Floor Area of Development: For the purposes of determining the total new floor area which may
be developed on the lot, the applicant may construct new floor area in the development such that
the total resulting floor area does not exceed the product of 3,000 square feet times the number of
dwelling units which could be developed under application of single-family zoning requirements
under the "Town of Ipswich Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land" and in
accordance with Sections VI., I.X.A. and IX.I. of this zoning bylaw. The Applicant shall submit a
Yield Plan which indicates the maximum number of lots achievable under a layout which
generally complies with the Town of Ipswich Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision
of Land, without altering any land areas in which such activity would be precluded by normal
application of state and town laws and regulations governing wetlands and riverfront areas, or by
the existence of floodplain areas. In unsewered areas, the Applicant shall provide evidence
acceptable to the Planning Board that individual on-site wastewater treatment and disposal
systems may be permitted and constructed to serve all the lots proposed under the Yield Plan as
submitted. This evidence shall include a demonstration of suitable soil and groundwater
conditions through representative sampling and testing of the buildable areas of the site by means
and methods approved by the Board of Health and shall at minimum consist of one determination
Page 107
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
of soil permeability and one observation of maximum ground water elevation per one acre of
otherwise buildable land, such tests being distributed with reasonable uniformity over the site.
b. Additional Floor Space: If the proposed use(s) allowed in a GSPDD pursuant to 2. above provides
more open space than is required by 5.c. of this subsection, then the new floor area to be
developed on the lot may be increased by ten percent (10%) for every five percent (5%) of
additional satisfactory open space provided.
c. Maximum Density: The total allowable floor area obtained through the application of the
formulae described in sub-paragraphs a. and b. above, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
area of the lot.
4. Building Design Standards
When constructing or renovating buildings associated with uses allowed in a GSPDD pursuant to 2.
above, the Applicant is encouraged to use green design and construction techniques that reduce
consumption of natural resources such as water and energy, improve the efficiency and longevity of
building systems, and minimize negative impacts on the environment and public health.
Applicants are also encouraged to choose building designs and materials that are attractive and
which complement the natural landscape.
5. Development Requirements
a. Town Water: The development shall be served by a water system deemed adequate for fire
protection and domestic use by the Water Commissioners and by the Fire Chief.
b. Sanitary Sewer/Septic: The development shall be served by the Town's sanitary sewer system or
by one or more on-site disposal systems conforming to the State Environmental Code, Title V and
the regulations of the Board of Health. If, however, in the judgment of the Board, the topography
and/or soil conditions are such that it would be more efficient to allow (i) a private central
sanitary sewer system, notwithstanding the lot's location in a Water Supply District, and/or (ii)
allow an underground common septic system or individual septic systems to be placed in the
preserved open space, this configuration may be permitted. Prior to making such judgment, the
Planning Board shall seek the review and recommendations of the Board of Health, Department
of Utilities, Board of Water Commissioners, and the Conservation Commission. If a use is
proposed within a portion of the GSPDD that is located within a Water Supply District and a
private central sanitary sewer system is proposed, the Planning Board shall not approve a special
permit under this subsection unless and until said system shall have received a favorable
recommendation from the Board of Water Commissioners. All systems are further subject to
approval by the Board of Health and any other governmental authority having jurisdiction.
c. Open Space Restriction: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the lot shall either be:
i. Conveyed to the Town of Ipswich and accepted by it for open space use;
ii. Conveyed to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of a state forest, park, or wildlife
management area;
iii. Conveyed to a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of
open space, and made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of Chapter 184 of the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts; or
iv. Made subject to a conservation restriction prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of Chapter 184 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts running in favor of either the Town or, upon the approval of the Planning
Board, a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open
space. The conservation restriction shall provide that such land shall be kept, in perpetuity,
in an open or natural state, in accordance with the above-noted sections of Chapter 184 of
the General Laws. In designating the open space, the applicant shall apply the guidelines
entitled CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING OPEN SPACE, adopted by the Planning Board
and amended from time to time. At least a portion of the open space shall be available for
Page 108
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
use by the general public, unless the applicant demonstrates to the Planning Boards
satisfaction why such access would be infeasible.
Page 109
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
d. Dimensional Regulations:
i. A minimum setback of one hundred (100) feet of naturally vegetated area shall be provided
from all street lines and abutting lots. The required one hundred (100) foot buffer strip shall
contain sufficient natural or landscape vegetation, i.e., dense evergreen over- and understory,
to effectively screen any development on the site that would otherwise be visible from
the streets abutting the property. An entry drive, along with appropriate signage, may be
permitted within the buffer strip. The Planning Board may increase by not more than twenty
percent (20%) any buffer area requirement if, after site plan review by the Board, the Board
deems such action to be reasonable and appropriate.
ii. The area developed for permitted uses, including buildings, parking, outdoor recreational
structures, and areas paved for vehicular use, shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the
total area of the lot. Walking or bicycle trails shall not be counted in the calculation of the
thirty percent (30%) limitation.
iii. The development shall be subject to design review and site plan review in accordance with
the provisions of Section IX.K. and Section X. of this bylaw, respectively.
iv. Newly constructed buildings in a GSPD shall be setback at least two hundred fifty (250) feet
from a public way.
e. Further Subdivision: After issuance of a special permit and site plan approval for any use(s)
allowed pursuant to 2. above, and establishment of the required open space for said uses, as a
whole, the subject property may be subdivided into lots which may be less than twenty-five (25)
acres in size and may be held in separate ownership, provided that each portion of the subdivided
site remains subject to all of the applicable terms and conditions of (i) the special permit, and (ii)
the site plan approval for the improvements on such portion of the site.
f. Phasing: Phasing of the uses allowed within a GSPDD, as approved by the Planning Board, shall
be permitted either pursuant to phasing described in the initial special permit application or in
subsequent special permit or site plan review applications. The special permit and site plan
approval shall not be deemed to have lapsed so long as the applicant shall have commenced use
of the special permit or site plan approval in substantial accordance with the phasing time frames
set forth in the special permit and site plan approval application. The Planning Board shall have
the authority to require a performance bond or other similar mechanism if it determines that such
a mechanism is necessary to ensure that the key components of the project are satisfactorily
completed.
6. Special Permit Application Process
All special permit applications for a use(s) allowed in a GSPDD pursuant to 2. above shall be made
and filed on the appropriate application form. For an application to be considered complete, it shall
provide all information required by the Rules and Regulations Governing Granting of Special
Permits, available from the Department of Planning and Development, and by any regulations
adopted in accordance with paragraph 10. below.
The special permit application shall also be accompanied by twenty (20) copies of a site
development report, which shall summarize how the proposed use(s) satisfies the special permit
criteria being considered by the Planning Board. The site development report should include, at
minimum, an inventory of natural resource features, wildlife and their habitat; a general inventory of
all existing buildings, structures and existing trails; a detailed description of the proposed
components of the development; a validated delineation of all wetlands and Riverfront areas on and
within one hundred (100) feet of the site, and all buffer zones and subzones thereto on the site; and
an outline of how the following issues and impacts will be addressed by the development: (a)
pedestrian and vehicular access to the site; (b) public safety issues; (c) provision of
landscaping/buffering; (d) protection of wildlife habitats; (e) provision of utilities; (f) open space and
recreation; (g) water supply and drainage issues; (h) layout and density of site development; (i)

not substantially altered subsequent to said date, and located on the same lot for which the
special permit is being sought, unless the accessory building is determined by the Planning
Board to be of historical or architectural significance, in which instance the building is
allowed to have been located on a lot elsewhere in Town on the effective date of Section
IX.P, but subsequently moved to the subject property prior to the submission of the special
permit application; and
b. The accessory building is located on a lot within the IR or RRA Districts having an area of at
least 10,000 square feet where the principal building is a single-family or two-family
residential dwelling. (Amended by STM 11/7/17; approved by AG 2/26/18)
Three-family dwellings in the IR District which satisfy the above Applicability requirements, but are
unable to meet the dimensional requirements set forth in the Table of Dimensional and Density
Regulations in Section VI. of this zoning bylaw, may also apply for a Planning Board special permit
in compliance with the requirements of this subsection, provided that the Applicant satisfies at
minimum the affordable housing requirement described in Section IX.I.3.a.(2) of this zoning bylaw.
3. Community Benefit
The Planning Board shall not grant a special permit under this subsection unless the applicant can
provide a community benefit as determined by the Board.
a. Any conversion of an accessory building into a residential unit subject to a permanent
affordability restriction shall be considered a community benefit. The definition of
affordable housing shall be as provided in the zoning bylaw at the time of application, except
that the Planning Board has the option to adjust the requirement provided that, at minimum,
the proposed unit be affordable to a household earning no more than eighty percent (80%) of
area median income.
b. Other potential uses or actions that the Planning Board may find to meet a community need
are as follows:
i. Use of the dwelling unit for a family member, provided that upon the unit being
vacated by family, use of the unit shall only be continued as a residential dwelling if
it is affordable housing as defined in 3.a. above.
ii. A fee in lieu of providing an affordable unit. If the Board decides to accept a fee in
lieu, the amount shall be $15,000. (Amended by STM 11/7/17; approved by AG 2/26/18)
iii. Preservation, renovation, and reuse of an accessory building determined by the
Planning Board to have historical or architectural significance.

Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
4. Standards for Reuse (Amended by STM 11/7/17; approved by AG 2/26/18)
a. Building: Existing accessory buildings shall not be demolished. In very limited instances, the
Planning Board may permit the demolition and reconstruction of an existing accessory
building, provided that one of the following conditions is met:
i. The Planning Board determines that the building does not have historical or
architectural significance, and due to the condition of the building, replacement is
more economically feasible than renovation. The applicant shall be required to
provide plans for replacement of a building that is in keeping with the principal
building on the lot, as well as other existing buildings in the neighborhood.
ii. If the building does have historical or architectural significance, as determined by
the Planning Board, the Board must find that reconstruction is the only economically
or physically feasible way of preserving it. Additionally, the building must be
reconstructed in a manner that does not, in the opinion of the Planning Board,
diminish its historical or architectural significance. Reconstruction can involve, but
is not limited to, replication of the original building.
b. Building site: Conversion of the accessory building shall take place on the existing building
footprint unless the Planning Board determines it is in the public interest that the building be
relocated within the lot boundaries. Instances in which the public interest might be served by
relocation include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
i. Current building encroaches on required setback.
ii. Relocation does not result in a building moving a distance of more than fifty percent
(50%) closer to existing buildings on abutting properties.
(Amended by Special Town Meeting 10/15/13; approved by Attorney General 1/13/14)
iii. The visual impact of the building on abutting properties is reduced or abutters
views are improved by the relocation of the accessory building.
c. Building envelope: Renovations to the building will be limited to the current envelope
except as follows (for the purposes of this subsection, building envelope is defined as all the
elements of the outer shell of a building that maintain an enclosed indoor environment):
i. Dormers, landing areas, stairs or other similar appurtenances related to the
conversion of a non-residential building to a dwelling unit, provided that the
appurtenances are either required by the building code, or deemed necessary by the
Planning Board to provide sufficient living space for the occupants.
ii. Exterior changes that, in the opinion of the Planning Board, enhance the historical or
architectural character of the building.
iii. For expansions otherwise allowed by right if the accessory building was not being
converted.
iv. If a proposed conversion satisfies i., ii., or iii. above, the Planning Board may allow
the building to be extended beyond the existing envelope subject to the following
conditions:
a) The building does not encroach any further than it currently does on
property lines or setbacks, except as it relates to the primary dwelling.
b) For buildings determined by the Planning Board to have historical or
architectural significance, there is no adverse effect on the historical or
architectural value of the building.
c) The change does not substantially alter the visual impact of the building on
abutting properties.
d) In no instance shall the building envelope of the accessory building be
increased by more than fifteen percent (15%) of its current volume,
including any appurtenances pursuant to c.i. and c.ii. above.
Page 113
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018
5. Additional Conditions and Considerations
a. Limitation of subdivision: No lot shown on a plan for which a permit is granted under this
section may be further subdivided.
b. Deed restriction: Except when the Planning Board determines that a fee shall be paid in lieu
of an affordable housing restriction per 3.b.ii. above, or an accessory building has historical
or architectural significance and is being preserved, renovated and reused, per 3.b.iii., a deed
restriction will be placed on the property to ensure that the affordability of the accessory
dwelling unit is maintained.
c. Monitoring: Applicant will be required to submit to the Planning Board, on an annual basis,
a letter confirming that the building converted by special permit under this provision is
currently occupied by a family member or being used as an affordable dwelling unit if
applicable.
d. Mixed use: Certain non-residential uses permitted in the bylaw may be allowed in the
accessory building.
e. Design Review Board: The Planning Board may request a consultation with the Design
Review Board concerning the conversion of an accessory building to a dwelling unit as
specified in this subsection.

Page 124
Ipswich Zoning Bylaw, updated STM October 18, 2018

surveyor, that all construction, including utilities, has been done in accordance with the
approved site plan; and
b. The Building Inspector verifies that all conditions of the approved site plan have been met.
2. Occupancy permits may be issued for a portion of any building or structure, if the only
incomplete work shown on the site plan is landscaping and/or roadway top course, and surety in
an amount approved by the Planning Board is posted to ensure that the incomplete landscaping
and/or roadway top course is completed within a reasonable time. The Planning Board may
allow surety to be posted for site work in addition to landscaping and the roadway top course, if
an unusual or unexpected event prevents the applicant from completing the site work.
J. Maintenance
All accessways, parking areas, fences, walls, landscaping, lighting, drainage, low impact
development integrated stormwater management facilities and waste disposal areas shall be
adequately maintained and repaired or replaced wherever and whenever necessary to insure

2. Parking lot interior (such as planting islands);
3. Screening parking areas, loading areas, rubbish removal bins, and outside storage, if applicable;
4. Street line plantings, and perimeter lot line plantings, where applicable.
To the extent feasible or practicable, landscaping should be designed in an environmentally sensitive
manner with non-invasive drought tolerant plants, as well as with salt tolerant species where exposed
to runoff from parking lots and driveways, so as to promote on-site infiltration of stormwater runoff,
and to reduce irrigation, heating and cooling needs. (Amended by 10/15/07 Special Town Meeting; approved by
Attorney General 1/23/08) (Amended by 10/19/09 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 5/17/10)
M. Modifications to Approved Site Plans
To request a modification to an approved site plan, an applicant shall submit to the Planning Board a
written description of the proposed modifications. Modified site plans will, in most instances, be
subject to the same submittal, review and hearing procedures as was the original filing. If the Board
determines that a particular modification is not significant and is consistent with the previously
approved site plan, the Board may decide not to hold an additional public hearing.
N. Application and Checklist
The Board shall adopt an application form, checklist, and regulations to assist applicants in
complying with these provisions. (Amended by 10/22/90 Special Town Meeting; approved by Attorney General 1/14/91)

the certificate of use and occupancy, institute and take any and all such action as may be necessary to
enforce the provisions of this bylaw.
If the Building Inspector is requested in writing to enforce this bylaw against any person allegedly in
violation of same, and he declines to act, he shall notify in writing the party requesting such

subsection, change of use shall mean any reconstruction, extension, alteration or change to a building
heretofore existing that creates a new use group which imposes other special provisions of law
governing building construction, equipment or means of egress).
Such certificate shall not be granted unless the proposed use of the land or building and all accessory
uses comply in all respects with this bylaw, and no use shall be made of such land or building except
the use or uses authorized by such certificate of use and occupancy.
Whenever any permit or certificate is refused because of some provision of this bylaw, the reason
therefore shall be clearly stated in writing.
In interpreting the provisions of this bylaw relative to an application for a specific permit or
certificate, the Building Inspector shall consider the provisions applicable on the date of application,

of Occupancy shall be issued by the Building Inspector, if at the time of application for said
permit or Certificate, there has been published by the Planning Board, as prescribed by law, notice of
a public hearing to consider an amendment to this bylaw at a town meeting to be held within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the date of said notice, and if the proposed building, structure or use

SECTION II. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 
2.1 UNAPPROVED SUBDIVISION PROHIBITED 
No subdivision of any land, improvement or sale of lots in a subdivision, or construction of streets or installation of municipal utilities therein shall be permitted unless and until a definitive plan of such subdivision has been submitted to and approved by the Board under the provisions of these regulations. 

2.2 LIMITATION OF ONE DWELLING ON ANY LOT 
No more than one building designed or available for use for dwelling purposes shall be erected or placed or converted to use as such on any lot in a subdivision, or elsewhere in the town, without the consent of the Board unless otherwise provided for in the Protective Zoning Bylaw. Such consent may be conditioned upon the providing of adequate ways furnishing access to each site for each such building, in the same manner as otherwise required for lots within a subdivision. 

2.3 ADEQUATE ACCESS FROM PUBLIC WAY 
2.3.1 Where the street system within a subdivision does not connect with or have, in the opinion of the Board, adequate access from a Town, County or State public way, the Board may require, as a condition of approval of a plan, that such adequate access be provided by the Applicant, and/or that the Applicant make physical improvements to and within such a way of access, from the boundary of the subdivision to the nearest public way capable of providing a safe flow of traffic to the subdivision. If determined necessary by the Board, the required improvements may include speed reduction measures that encourage motorists to travel within the posted speed limits of the public way(s). 
2.3.2 Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the Applicant to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to a width at least commensurate with that required within the subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within such public way to the same standards required within the subdivision. Any such dedication of land for the purpose of widening the way and any such work performed within such public way shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne by the Applicant. 

2.4 EFFECT OF PRIOR RECORDING 
The recording of a plan of subdivision within the Town at the Registry of Deeds or the Land Court prior to the effective date of the Subdivision Control Law in the Town of Ipswich (February 18, 1954) shall not exempt the land within such subdivision from the application and operation of these Rules and Regulations except as specifically exempted in M.G.L c.41, Section 81. 

2.5 FAILURE TO COMPLY; WAIVERS 
2.5.1 Failure	 to Comply: Failure substantially to comply with the provisions of these Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts, shall be reason for denial of a subdivision filed thereunder. 
9 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

2.5.2 Waivers: The Board may waive strict compliance with any of these regulations if it deems such waiver to be in the public interest and if written record is kept of each such waiver and the reasons for it. In approving waivers, the Board may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standard(s) or requirement(s) waived. 

2.6 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY 
2.6.1 The provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.6.2 These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other Bylaw, regulation, statute, or other provision of law. If any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other regulation, Bylaw or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes a higher standard shall apply. 
2.6.3 	If any part or provision of these regulations, or if application of any part or provision of these regulations to any particular circumstances, is adjudged to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application of the remainder of these regulations as a whole to other circumstances. 

2.7 RESERVATION AND APPEALS 
Upon adoption of these regulations, the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts adopted on May 8, 1979, as amended, are hereby repealed (except to such section(s) expressly described in M.G.L. c.41, Section 81.) 

2.8 AMENDMENTS 
The Board may from time to time amend these regulations. Public hearings on all proposed amendments shall be held by the Board in the manner described in M.G.L. c. 41, Section 81-Q.

i.) joined to and made part of an adjacent existing lot; or 
ii.) "Not a Building Lot"; or 
c) contains a building which existed prior to the date on which subdivision control was adopted in the Town; or 
d) constitutes an existing parcel with no new lot division. If the lot is not being subdivided and does not contain frontage on a way, as specified above, the lot shall be clearly marked on the plan that it is "Not a Building Lot." 



3.3 DETERMINATION OF FRONTAGE 
In determining whether each and every lot shown on the plan has adequate frontage, the Board will determine first whether the lot directly abuts a public or private way, and second, whether the lot has direct, practical access from the abutting way. 
3.3.1 In determining whether an existing way is adequate to qualify a plan as not constituting a subdivision, the Board may consider the following conditions, among others: 
a) Does the existing horizontal and vertical alignment of the traveled way provide safe visibility? 
b) Is the right-of-way at least forty feet (40') wide and of reasonable horizontal alignment? 
c) Is the traveled way constructed at least eighteen feet (18') wide, with at least eight inches (8") depth of gravel, and with adequate provisions for drainage? 
d) If the road could ever serve six (6) or more buildings and/or lots, is it bituminous surfaced or have provisions been made for such surfacing without cost to the Town? 
e) Have provisions been made for public utilities without cost to the Town? 

3.4 BOARD ACTION 
If the Board finds that the plan does not require approval, it shall forthwith, without a public hearing, endorse the plan under the words "Approval under Subdivision Control Law Not Required". The Board may add to such endorsement a statement of the reason approval is not required. The plan will be returned to the Applicant and the Board shall notify the Town Clerk of its action. 
13 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

If the Board determines that the plan does require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, it shall, within twenty-one (21) days of the submission of said plan, provide written notice of its determination to the Applicant and return the plan. The Board shall also notify the Town Clerk of its action. 
If the Board fails to act upon a plan submitted under this section within twenty-one (21) days after its submission, it shall be deemed to have found that approval under the Subdivision Control Law is not required.

Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 



SECTION IV. PROCEDURE FOR SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF A PRELIMINARY SUBDIVISION 
4.1 PURPOSE 
A Preliminary Plan of a subdivision may be submitted by an applicant to the Board for discussion and approval, modification or disapproval by the Board. The submission of such a Preliminary Plan enables the Applicant, the Board, other municipal agencies and officials and the owners of property abutting the subdivision to discuss and clarify any problems the proposed subdivision may present before a Definitive Plan is prepared. 
It is suggested that the Applicant first read these Rules and Regulations carefully and thoroughly and then meet informally with the Board with a sketch of the area of the proposed subdivision to obtain information about the subdivision requirements of the area. Any uncertainties and ambiguities about the Rules and Regulations or the requirements in the Appendices should be raised during this initial consultation. Informal discussions with other Town officials also may prove helpful at this phase of the development. 
It is strongly recommended that a Preliminary Plan be filed in every case. In accordance with M.G.L. c. 41, s.81-S, in the case of a non-residential subdivision, the submission of a Preliminary Plan is required. However, the submission of a Preliminary Plan for subdivision showing lots in a residential zone is left to the discretion of the applicant. 

4.2 APPLICATION PROCEDURE 
Any person who desires approval of a Preliminary Plan for the subdivision of land shall: 
4.2.1 File with the Board and with the Board of Health, a Form B application. 
4.2.2 Submit with the application a reproducible Preliminary Plan, prepared in accordance with the form described under Section 4.3, and thirteen (13) contact prints to the Board and two (2) contact prints to the Board of Health.

b) The expected change in the condition of relevant road systems as a result of the proposed development; 
c) The comparison on a per-acre basis of the total vehicular traffic generation from the proposed development with: 
i) The existing and potential vehicular traffic generation from all other developments accessing relevant road systems; and 
ii) The vehicular traffic generation which would be expected to produce a LOS below LOS "C"; and 
d) In determining the impact of vehicular traffic generation from a development, the following standards and definitions shall be used (unless the Applicant demonstrates to the Planning Board that given the nature of the proposed project or applicable road systems, other standards are appropriate): 
29 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

i) Trip generation rates for land uses as listed in the most recent update of Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers, Washington, D.C.; and 
ii) Levels of Service: "Level of Service (LOS) is a term which traffic engineers use to define the various operating conditions that occur on a roadway or intersection when accommodating various traffic volumes; although LOS is a qualitative measure of traffic flow, it is an acceptable measurement for determining overall impact of development on roadway networks; LOS "A" is associated with relatively free-flow and average overall traffic speed in excess of 30 miles per hour; LOS "B" represents stable flow with minor delays and speeds of 25 miles per hour or greater; LOS "C" corresponds to the design capacity of a road system and indicates stable flow with delays, and speeds of 20 miles per hour or more; LOS "D", "E", and "F" correspond to decreasing abilities to travel greater than 15 miles per hour and correspond to the over-capacity of the road system. 

5.4.4.7 Cost/Benefit Analysis 
The Applicant shall provide a cost/benefit analysis of the development at full build-out; this municipal cost/benefit analysis should follow standard and usual procedures for measuring both the benefits to be derived and costs to be incurred by the Town of Ipswich as a result of the proposed development; this also should estimate net benefits or costs of non-quantifiable environmental impacts. 
5.5 REVIEW PROCEDURES 
5.5.1 Application Review: Within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the Definitive Plan Application (Form C) with the Board, the Board's Designee shall notify the Board and the Applicant in writing of any missing or incomplete information in the application. At that time, the Applicant may withdraw an incomplete application by notifying the Board and the Town Clerk, in writing, of the decision to withdraw the application from consideration. 
If the Applicant withdraws the application, the filing fee shall be forfeited. 
If the Applicant does not withdraw an incomplete application within seven (7) days of notification of incompleteness, the Board shall proceed to advertise and hold a Public Hearing on the application as submitted. No additional information or materials shall be accepted for review after the receipt of application is acknowledged by the Board without their express written consent. If the Board approves the acceptance of additional submission materials, the Applicant is required to formally amend the application with amendment materials being provided to the Town Clerk, the Board of Health and the Board. 
5.5.2 Public Hearing: Upon determination by the Board that the application for approval of the Definitive Plan is complete, or that it is incomplete and the Applicant has failed to withdraw or seek to formally amend the application, the Board shall set a date for the public hearing and so notify the Applicant. 
30 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

Notice of the hearing shall be arranged by the Board or the Board's Designee, at the Applicant's expense, by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in Ipswich in each of two (2) successive weeks, the first publication being not less than fourteen (14) days before the day of such hearing: and by mailing, not less than ten (10) days before the date of the hearing, a copy of the advertisement to all owners of land abutting upon the land included in the plan as appearing on the most recent tax list. 
5.5.3 Report of the Board of Health: The Board of Health shall submit a written report to the Board within forty-five (45) days after the plan is filed. Said report shall indicate approval or disapproval of said plan and, in the event of disapproval, shall make specific findings in the report, and where possible, shall make recommendations for adjustment. Failure to report within forty-five (45) days after filing shall be deemed approved by the Board of Health. If the proposed subdivision is to be serviced by the Ipswich sewage system, failure to report within forty-five (45) days after filing shall also be deemed approved by the Board of Health. 
Extreme care shall be practiced in the layout of a subdivision in unsewered areas. The extent of soil evaluation shall be determined by the Ipswich Board of Health Agent based on the Town of Ipswich Soils Maps and whatever other soil information is available. The tests which may be required include deep hole test holes, percolation tests and test borings, and the number of tests required shall be determined by the Board of Health Agent. 
Before any building construction may commence on a lot, a permit to construct an individual subsurface absorption area must be obtained from the Board of Health for each such individual lot not served by the Ipswich sewage system, if required; moreover, a condition shall be inscribed on the plan as follows: "No building or structure shall be built or placed on any lot without a permit from the Board of Health, if such a permit is required." 
5.5.4 Plan Review by Other Town Officials: Prior to approval of any Definitive Plan, the Board shall give due regard to the reports of the Town Planner, the Town Engineer, the Director of Public Works, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Public Safety, the Fire Chief, the Conservation Commission and any technical expert hired by the Board. 
Where any deviations from the design requirements specified by these Rules and Regulations or the Town of Ipswich's design standards and construction specifications are indicated on the plan, the Board's designee shall so notify the Board and shall provide a written statement approving or disapproving said deviation. 
The Board's designee shall also provide a recommendation of the proper amount of security as required in Section 6. This recommendation shall be based on information provided by the Applicant on the cost of performing the various items of work described in the plans. Due to the fact that the Board is using the security as assurance of project completion, the Board may, at their reasonable discretion, factor in administrative costs, applicable prevailing wage schedules, engineering and inspection services and a contingency for the project. 

5.6 DECISION: 
After the Public Hearing the Board will approve, modify and approve or disapprove the plan as submitted. Criteria for action by the Board shall be the following: 
31 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

a) 	completeness and technical adequacy of the plans and supporting materials; 
b) 	determination that development at the proposed location does not entail unwarranted hazard to safety, health and convenience of future residents of the development or of others because of possible traffic hazards, or environmental degradation which could be avoided or ameliorated through an alternative plan; 
c) 	conformity with the design and construction standards described in these Rules and Regulations and in attached Appendices; 
d) 	conformity with all applicable zoning requirements; 
e) 	consistency with the purposes of the Subdivision Control Law as described in M.G.L. c.41, s.81M. 
Following such action, and within ninety (90) days of receipt of the Definitive Plan, the Board shall file a certificate of its action with the Town Clerk. In the event a Preliminary Plan has not been filed, or in the event that a Preliminary Plan previously had been filed and disapproved by the Board, the Board shall file a certificate of vote within one hundred thirty-five (135) days of receipt of the Definitive Plan. 
5.6.1 Time Extensions: Further time, as may be agreed upon by the Board and the Applicant, may be allowed for the Board's decision. Such time extensions shall be at the written request of the Applicant and such notice(s) of time extension shall be filed forthwith by the Board with the Town Clerk. 

5.7 	PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE: 
5.7.1 Performance Guarantee -Construction Element: Before endorsement of approval, the Board shall require that timely construction of improvements indicated on the Definitive Plan be secured by one, or in part by one and in part by another, of the methods described in Sections 5.7 a.,b., and c. which method(s) may be selected and from time to time may be varied by the Applicant. The sufficiency of the amount and type of the security shall be determined by the Board, based on the costs of construction. The Board shall, at their reasonable discretion, include provisions for administrative costs, applicable prevailing wage schedules, and contingency to cover the costs of completion should the Board be required to complete the construction. A separate surety may be required for erosion control or wetlands impacts relating to site construction. The alternative methods of security are as follows: 
a) by a proper performance bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities, in an amount to be determined by the Board to be sufficient to cover the cost of the construction of the ways and the installation of municipal services. Each bond or deposit shall be computed on the basis that such construction and installation be completed within such period of time as the Board shall determine. (See Forms D and E for the suggested forms); 
b) by covenant running with the land, which shall be executed and recorded by the owner of record, whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed by other than mortgage deed, provided, that a mortgagee who acquires title to the mortgaged premises by foreclosure or otherwise and any succeeding owner of such premises or part thereof may sell any such lot, subject, to that portion of the covenant which provides that 
32 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

no lot shall be built upon until such ways and services have been provided to serve such lot; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit a conveyance by a single deed, subject to such covenant, of either the entire parcel of land shown on the subdivision plan or of all lots not previously released by the Board. A deed of any part of the subdivision in violation hereof shall be voidable by the grantee prior to the release of the covenant but not later than three years from the date of such deed. (See Form F for suggested form.) 
In order to determine if the lots are adequate security, the Board may require appraisal(s), completed by a licensed appraiser, of the lots to be held as security. Said appraisal(s) shall be at the sole expense of the Applicant. 
c) by delivery to the Board of an agreement executed by the Applicant and the lender after recording of the first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a portion thereof given as security for advances to be made to the Applicant by the lender. This agreement shall provide for retention by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion of the Board to secure the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services. Said agreement shall also provide for a schedule of disbursements which may be made to the Applicant upon completion of various stages of the work, and shall further provide that in the event the work is not completed within the time set forth by the Applicant, any funds remaining undisbursed shall be available for completion. Any covenant given under the preceding paragraph and any condition required by the Board of Health or Health Agent shall be either inscribed on the plan or contained in a separate document, referred to on the plan. 
5.7.2 Performance Guarantee --Fees for Inspectional Services: Before endorsement of approval, the Board shall require the Applicant to submit a cash deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Board, of a sum sufficient to guarantee payment for the services of the Board's subdivision inspector. The amount of this deposit or letter of credit shall be determined, and may be revised from time to time, by the Board, exercising its reasonable judgment. 

5.8 ENDORSEMENT AND FILING OF DOCUMENT: 
The Board's approval of a Definitive Subdivision Plan, if granted, shall be endorsed on the plan only after the expiration of the twenty (20) day appeal period and after certification of the Town Clerk that no appeals have been taken.

SECTION VI. REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN 
6.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: 
In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and construction to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access for police, emergency and medical, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and other road maintenance equipment; to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system; to avoid undue financial burdens for present and future taxpayers; and to avoid potential natural or technological hazards or nuisances, including the problems associated with uncontrolled storm water run­off, the Board has established the design of subdivisions set forth in this Section. 
In addition to the requirements established in these regulations, all subdivisions shall conform to the provisions of the Town of Ipswich Protective Zoning Bylaw, the regulations of the Ipswich Board of Health, the Town of Ipswich Water Rules and Regulations, the Town of Ipswich Sewer Regulations, the Ipswich Wetlands Protection Bylaw and Rules and Regulations of the Ipswich Conservation Commission, and all other rules and regulations applicable in the development of land in Ipswich. 

6.2 CHARACTER OF THE LAND 
6.2.1 Protection of Natural Features: In laying out a subdivision, the Applicant shall comply with these rules and regulations with due regard to all natural features such as large trees, natural groupings of trees, watercourses, scenic or historic elements, aquifers, flood plains, and habitats of rare or endangered plant and animal species. These features shall be left undisturbed wherever practical and the Board may waive design requirements in order to protect important natural features. The Applicant is strongly encouraged to leave as many existing trees as possible extant and to protect those trees during construction to retain natural character, filter stormwater and provide shade to the future development. 
6.2.2 Unsuitable Land: Land which the Board finds to be unsuitable for development due to flooding, improper drainage or adverse drainage, adverse topography, poor soils, bedrock, location of utility easements, or other features which the Board has reason to believe would be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding area, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate measures are formulated by the Applicant and are approved by the Board to eliminate or minimize any short-term or long-term impacts created by development of the unsuitable land. 
6.2.3 Subdivisions Straddling Municipal Boundaries: Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in another Town, the Board may require documentation that access has been legally established in that Town as a public street or as part of an approved subdivision. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundaries. 
38 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

6.2.4 Self-Imposed Restrictions: If, as part of a subdivision application, the Applicant or Owner places voluntary restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision which are greater than the requirements of these Regulations or of the Town of Ipswich Protective Zoning Bylaw, such restrictions or references thereto shall be indicated and located on the Definitive Plan and shall be recorded in the Essex South District Registry of Deeds or the Land Court. 


6.3 LOTS 
6.3.1 Lot Arrangement: 	Lots shall be arranged so there will be no foreseeable difficulties due to topography, soils, wetlands, bedrock, improper drainage, or other conditions, in securing permits to build upon all lots in compliance with the Town of Ipswich Protective Zoning Bylaw, nor in providing practical, feasible driveway access to a building on each such lot. 
6.3.2 Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Town of Ipswich Protective Zoning Bylaw. Dimensions of corner lots should be large enough to allow for erection of buildings and fulfilling the minimum front yard setback and lot width from both streets. Depth and width of properties laid out for business or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required by the Protective Zoning Bylaw. 
6.3.3 Lot Configuration: Except for corner lots, lots should not have double frontage on two rights-of-way and shall not be oddly shaped. To discourage oddly shaped lots the angle of the sidelines shall be as close as is practicable to ninety (90) degrees or radial to a curve. 
6.3.4 Soil Preservation, Sedimentation and Erosion Control: The Applicant shall comply with the Rules and Regulations Governing Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control as provided for in Appendix IX. of these Rules and Regulations. 
6.3.5 Lot Drainage: Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all proposed buildings. Individual lot drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentrating storm water drainage from each lot to adjacent lots and/or to the street. 
6.3.6 Debris and Waste: No debris, junk, rubbish or other non-biodegradable waste materials shall be buried on any land in the subdivision or left on any lot or on the street right of way, and removal of the same shall be required prior to final release of any covenant or security. Burial of biodegradable materials on the site shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Health and the Planning Board or the Planning Board's Designee. It should be noted that no burial areas will be allowed if located within the buffer zones under the jurisdiction of the Ipswich Conservation Commission. The burial location(s) and description of buried materials shall be noted on the "as-built" plans. The Board may require that the description and the location of buried materials be recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Court prior to the release of affected lots for sale or building. 
6.4 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS: 
The specifications for construction that are provided in this Section VI are supplemented by Appendices I through IX of these Rules and Regulations, and together these two sections provide the required construction standards. The Board, upon recommendation from the Board's Designee, shall determine if the standards have been met. 
39

6.5.2 Inspections: Each phase or step in the construction of the required improvements shall be inspected and approved in writing by the Board's Designee. The Board's Designee may require submittals and testing as necessary to assure proper construction. As a minimum, the Applicant shall request an inspection at the following stages of construction: 
a) 	following preparation of the street subgrade and shoulders and prior to the placement on any fill; 
b) 	following installation of all underground drainage and utilities, prior to backfilling; 
c) 	following spreading and compaction of the gravel base, prior to application of the binder course on the street; 
d) 	immediately prior to and during the application and compaction of the surface course on the street and, if required, on the sidewalk; 
e) 	following completion of all improvements and installation of bounds. The Applicant shall not proceed with construction of any of the above stages of development until the Board's Designee has signed off on the previous stage. 
The Board's Designee may require inspection at such other intervals as (s)he may deem necessary to assure proper construction of improvements, including but not limited to as-built drawing submittals required under Section 5.15. In addition, the Board's Designee may require periodic inspection reports from the Applicant's engineer. 

6.6 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS 
6.6.1 Clearing and Grubbing: The area between property lines within the right of way shall be cleared and grubbed as necessary to construct the required travel way and to provide required sight distances, except for those trees which are intended to be preserved as street trees. Said trees shall be protected by the erection of a six (6) foot high temporary fence around the tree, to be located at the drip line unless otherwise specified by the Board. 
6.6.2 Earth Excavation: All excavation shall conform to the lines and grades shown on the approved Definitive Plan(s). Where mucky soils, ledge or clay is encountered within the right of way, it shall be removed entirely and, where necessary, replaced with sand and gravel.

6.7.2 Improving Existing Streets: 	If a subdivision borders and existing but inadequately constructed public or private street, the applicant may be required to improve the street bordering the subdivision tract or provide the land necessary for future improvements for that portion bordering the subdivision. 
Land used for or reserved for future street improvements may not be counted in satisfying the setback and area requirements of the Town of Ipswich Protective Zoning Bylaw. 
6.7.3 Topography and Arrangement: Streets shall be designed to conform as closely as possible to the original topography of the site; nevertheless, a combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. 
6.7.4 Street Names: Proposed street names shall be included on the plans and shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the Town so as not to cause confusion. A street which is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. Written approval of the proposed street name must be obtained from the Director of Public Safety and shall be included in the application submitted to the Board. 
6.7.5 Street Numbers: Street numbers shall be assigned by the Chief Assessor in consultation with public safety officials, and shall be included in the application submitted to the Board.

6.14 	STORM DRAINAGE (SEE APPENDIX II  SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS AND APPENDIX VIII -RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING STORMWATER MANAGEMENT) 
Storm water run-off shall be mitigated through a combination of storage and controlled release, as required in the Rules and Regulations Governing Storm Water Management (See Appendix VIII.), the Town of Ipswich Stormwater Bylaw and Regulations, and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Stormwater Management Standards, as applicable. Drainage systems shall be designed according to the following principles and criteria: 
6.14.1 Peak Flows: Property shall be developed in such a manner as to maximize storm water recharge on the site and to minimize direct overland run-off into adjoining streets and watercourses. Peak flows and run-off at the boundaries of the subdivision shall be no higher following development than before development, for the 10 and 100 year storm events. 
6.14.2 Capacity: Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to handle all storm water run-off presently flowing through the subdivision, as well as to dispose of any additional run-off generated by the proposed development up to and including the run-off from a one hundred (100) year storm using the following methods: 
48 
Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

a) the flow from storms of up to a twenty-five (25) year frequency and a twenty-four (24) hour duration shall be conveyed through the storm drain system on the subdivision site. Storm drain piping and grade inlets shall be designed for a 25 year storm event; 
b) Detention facilities and culverts shall be provided to handle all run-off, up to and including the run-off generated by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm. As a minimum, detention basin routing calculations shall be prepared for the ten (10) and one hundred (100) year storm events. 
6.14.3 Release Rate: The combination of storage and design release rate shall not result in storage duration of greater than seventy-two (72) hours. Maximum depth of storm water detention/retention areas shall be two feet (2). 
6.14.4 Outlet Structures: Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall require little or no maintenance for proper operation. 
6.14.5 Emergency Overflow: 	Each storm water detention area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event of a storm in excess of the one hundred (100) year frequency type. 
6.14.6 Natural Patterns: 	Natural drainage patterns shall be used wherever possible. All existing watercourses shall be left open unless approval to close them is obtained through the Conservation Commission. All new open watercourses shall be appropriately seeded, sodded, and riprapped. 
6.14.7 Alteration: Any alteration of land on the site shall be such that changes in existing patterns of drainage shall not affect properties outside the subdivision by increasing the amount or rate of peak flow. 
6.14.8 Structured Systems: If soil conditions or topography make natural drainage systems impractical and existing drains in adjacent streets or easements have adequate capacity to accommodate the drainage flow from the subdivision, a structured system shall be used and appropriate connection to the existing Town drainage system shall be made. 
6.14.9 Calculations: 	Hydraulic calculations, prepared by a registered professional engineer, shall be submitted to substantiate all design features of any proposed drainage system. Computations for run­off shall be made in accordance with standard engineering practice, acceptable to the Town Engineer and/or the Board's Designee, and the method of calculation shall be noted. 
6.14.10 Basin Side Slopes: Basin area side slopes shall be kept as close as possible to natural land contours, 
i.e. ten percent (10%) or less wherever possible. A maximum 6:1 side slope may be constructed for the interior of the basin areas. For security purposes fencing may be required by the Board. Drainage basins shall be designed for easy access for maintenance vehicles and personnel. 
6.14.11 Drainage Easements: If it is necessary to carry drainage across lots within the subdivision, storm drainage easements shall be provided, of such width and construction as will be adequate to accommodate the volume and velocity of the run-off. However, no such easement shall be less than thirty feet (30') in width. 
49 Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 
If a detention basin is proposed, the boundary of the required easement shall be at least twelve feet (12) beyond the maximum extent of the one-hundred (100) year flood stage and further, the easement should be configured to provide construction vehicles with adequate access around the perimeter of the basin. 
If a proposed drainage system would carry water across land outside the subdivision boundaries to an approved outfall, appropriate drainage rights shall be secured by the subdivider at the subdivider's expense, and shall be referenced on the Definitive Plan. 
6.14.12 Roof Runoff: All primary dwelling structures within a residential subdivision and all buildings within a non-residential subdivision shall have a rainwater harvesting system designed to collect preferably 100% of roof run-off for a two inch (2) rainfall, but at minimum, the system shall collect 75% of the run-off. When practicable, collected roof run-off should be used for landscape irrigation purposes. Excess stormwater may be recharged. Prior to the Boards sign-off for the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, the Board shall assure that these systems have been installed as designed and approved. The Board may use its Technical Review Consultant/Subdivision Inspector to provide the Board with this assurance. 
6.14.13 Soft Structure Drainage: When feasible and appropriate, applicants shall use natural-looking, open drainage instead of closed, hard engineering structures as otherwise required in these regulations. 
Examples of these Low-Impact Development design techniques include: 
a. 
Bio-retention facilities; 

b. 
Filter/buffer strips and other multifunctional landscape areas; 

c. 
Grassed swales, bio-retention swales, and wet swales; and 

d. 
Infiltration techniques 


Information on these practices can be obtained from the documents referenced in Section 6.14.

Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts 

IX. 	RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING SEDIMENTATION AND EROSION CONTROL 
1. 	Purpose and Intent 
These regulations are to prevent adverse environmental impacts due to erosion, soil loss and sedimentation, including secondary and cumulative, caused by alterations to vegetation and soil surfaces during land development. 
Sedimentation and erosion control structures are required to prevent sediment from clogging stormwater/drainage systems and road ditches. These structures also prevent sediment from entering ponds, streams, reservoirs, watercourses, wetlands and other critical resources within which it is a pollutant. In many cases, these structures detain stormwater runoff, thus preventing flooding of downstream areas. 
Responsibility for periodic inspection, maintenance and repair of these control structures and systems to insure they continue to operate consistent with approved design lies solely with the Applicant, until such time as the street(s) and all other improvements in the subdivision are accepted by the Town. 
2. 	General Requirements 
a. 	
If the Applicant's proposed development creates six (6) or more house lots or otherwise requires submission of an Environmental and Community Impact Analysis pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the Applicant shall submit a separate plan therewith, which plan shall contain the elements in Section B. and which complies with all other provisions of this Appendix. All subdivision applications must comply with the Performance, Design, and Maintenance Standards in paragraph B. below, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) Stormwater Management Policy Handbook, and the DEPs Massachusetts Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for Urban and Suburban Areas:  A Guide for Planners, Designers, and Municipal Officials and be subject to final inspection before acceptance, as specified herein. The DEP manuals are available for review at the Town of Ipswichs Planning and Development Office as well as online. 

b. 	
The Applicant shall submit an erosion/sedimentation control plan which shall include the following: 


1) existing and proposed grades, elevations, and contours; 
2) location and description of existing natural and manmade features on the property and within one
