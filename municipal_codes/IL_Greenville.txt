(Ord. 2521, passed 1-11-2000; Ord. 2573, passed 1-8-2002; Ord. 3150, passed
11-14-2017)



§ 30.05  REMOTE MEETING ATTENDANCE.



   (A)   Policy statement. It is the policy of the city that any member
of the City Council may attend and participate in any open or closed meeting
of the City Council from a remote location via telephone, video or internet
connection; provided that, such attendance and participation is in compliance
with this policy and any other applicable laws.



   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the City Council may attend from a
remote location if the member meets the following conditions, a quorum is
physically present throughout the meeting and a majority of a quorum of the
City Council votes to approve the remote attendance.



      (1)   The member should notify the City Clerk/Finance Director
at least 24 hours before the meeting so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance.



      (2)   The member must assert one of the following three
reasons why he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:



         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal
illness or disability;



         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment
purposes or the business of the city; or



         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or
other emergency.



   (C)   Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a
quorum is physically present, any member present may move that a member be
permitted to participate remotely, specifying the reason entitling the absent
member to participate remotely. All of the members physically present are
permitted to vote on whether remote participation will be allowed. The motion
must be approved by a vote of a majority of the quorum.



   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating remotely
and other members of the City Council must be able to communicate
effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communications. Before approving remote attendance at any meeting, the city
shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective.



   (E)   Minutes. Any member participating remotely shall be considered
an off-site participant and counted as present by means of video or audio
conference, for that meeting if the member is allowed to participate. The
meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member
is physically present, present by video or present by audio means.



   (F)   Rights of remote member. A member permitted to participate
remotely will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and
participate in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject
to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and
adhered to. The remote member shall be heard, considered and counted as to
any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any remote member shall be called
during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the
Clerk/Finance Director and placed in the minutes for the corresponding
meeting. A member participating remotely may leave a meeting and return as in
the case of any member.



   (G)   Meetings. The term MEETING, as used herein, refers to any
gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference, telephone call,
electronic means (such as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic
chat and instant messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive
communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held
for the purposes of discussing public business.



   (H)   Closed meetings. A quorum of the City Council must be
physically present at any closed meeting. Members participating remotely
shall otherwise be entitled to participate in closed meetings by video or
audio conference, in the same manner as at an open meeting.



   (I)   Committees, boards and commissions.



      (1)   This policy shall apply to all committees, boards and
commissions established by authority of the City Council.



      (2)   However, when remote attendance is possible only by
audio connection, and an off-site member will be unable to view visual
exhibits or demonstrations which may influence a decision by the committee,
board or commission, remote attendance should not be approved.



(Ord. 2734, passed 2-13-2007)



§ 30.06  PRESIDING OFFICER.



   (A)   The Mayor shall be the presiding officer of the Council at all
meetings.



   (B)   (1)   In the event that the Mayor is unable to be
physically present at a regular or special meeting, the meeting will be led
by Mayor Pro Tem.



      (2)   The Mayor Pro Tem shall rotate by quarter based on the
years of service of each councilman, if willing to serve.



      (3)   The councilman with the most years of experience shall
serve as Mayor Pro Tem for the fourth quarter, second most years of
experience shall serve as Mayor Pro Tem for the first quarter, third most
years of experience shall serve as Mayor Pro Tem for second quarter, and
fourth most years of experience shall serve as May or Pro Tem for third
quarter.



      (4)   Rotation schedule shall continue to be adjusted as the
composition of the City Council changes, but will follow the schedule set
forth above.

GENERAL PROVISIONS




§ 34.001  GENERAL PURPOSE/SCOPE.



   (A)   This manual is a general informational guide to the city’s
current employment policies and shall not be construed as a contract, implied
or otherwise. The city reserves the right to amend, delete, supplement or
rescind any of the provisions of this manual, as the city deems necessary and
appropriate, without advance notice. These policies shall not be construed to
create contractual rights or any type of promise or guarantee of specific
treatment upon which any employee may rely. The city also reserves the right
to deviate from these policies at any time, in order to achieve its primary
mission of providing orderly and cost efficient services to its citizens.



   (B)   These personnel policies shall apply to all city employees.
They shall not apply to elected officials and independent contractors. In the
event of conflict between any specific provision of this manual and any
provision of a valid and effective collective bargaining contract, the terms
of the collective bargaining agreement will govern the particular issue with
regard to employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Rules and
regulations of Board of Police Commissioners will take precedence with regard
to particular issues covered thereby for employees covered by those rules and
regulations. In all other cases, these policies shall govern.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.002  NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.



   (A)   Employment with the city is voluntary on the part of both
parties.



   (B)   All employment with the city is on an at-will basis.



   (C)   As such, either the employee or the city may terminate the
employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, as either party
may deem appropriate.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.003  ADMINISTRATION OF RULES BY CITY MANAGER.



   The City Manager shall administer or cause to be administered the
provisions of this manual. The City Manager shall be responsible for the
resolution of any problem or problems which may arise regarding the personnel
policies, with the advice and consent of the City Council, except where the
duties by statute are the sole and exclusive duties of the City Manager.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.004  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.



   (A)   The city is an equal employment opportunity employer. The city
employs, retains, promotes, terminates and otherwise treats all employees and
job applicants on the basis of merit, qualifications and competence. This
policy shall be applied without regard to any individual’s sex, race,
color, religion, national origin, age, marital status or disability.



   (B)   The city will not discriminate against applicants or employees
with a disability. However, to be considered as a qualified
candidate/employee with a disability, the individual must have the ability to
perform the essential functions of the position, either with or without
reasonable accommodations. The city engages in the interactive process with
employees. As such, any employee needing an accommodation should make this
known to their supervisor. The city will engage in the interactive process in
an attempt to accommodate individuals with disabilities.



   (C)   Employees with life threatening illnesses, such as cancer,
heart disease or AIDS/HIV conditions, or communicable diseases such as
tuberculosis or influenza, are treated the same as all other employees. They
are permitted to continue working so long as they are able to maintain an
acceptable level of performance and medical evidence shows they are not a
threat to themselves or their co-workers. The city will work to preserve the
safety of all of its employees and reserves the right to reassign employees
or take other job actions when a health or safety risk to fellow city
employees or the public exists.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.005  SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   It is the policy of the city to provide a work environment for
its employees which is free from discrimination and intimidation. The city
will not tolerate any form of unlawful harassment. Prompt disciplinary action
will be taken against an employee who commits or participates in any form of
unlawful harassment, which includes harassment based on an individual’s
sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, citizenship status, marital
status, handicap or disability.



   (B)   (1)   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that
person’s sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form
of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended in 1991.



      (2)   SEXUAL HARASSMENT is defined as unwanted, unwelcome
sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature when:



         (a)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made
either implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of an individual’s
employment;



         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for any employment related decision affecting
the individual; or



         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance, or creating
an offensive, intimidating, degrading or hostile work environment.



      (3)   Such conduct is illegal. Examples of sexual harassment
may include sexual innuendos, suggestive or insulting sounds, unauthorized
touching of a sexual nature, making requests for sexual favors, pressure to
engage in sexual activity as a condition of employment or promotion, leering
or ogling, telling jokes or stories of a sexual nature, or textual or
electronic messages with sexual content.



   (C)   If an employee feels he or she is being harassed based upon
his or her sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, citizenship
status, marital status, handicap or disability, he or she should at once make
his or her feelings known to his or her immediate supervisor, either as an
electronic or direct communication. All complaints will be investigated and,
where appropriate, disciplinary action taken. If the employee feels that the
matter cannot be discussed with his or her supervisor, or if he or she is not
satisfied with the way his or her report has been handled, he or she should
arrange for a conference with the City Manager to discuss the complaint.
Remember, do not assume the city is aware of harassment. It is the
employee’s responsibility to report incidents he or she knows about.



   (D)   (1)   In addition, employees who believe they are being
harassed may contact the State Department of Human Rights at (217)785-5100 or
the State Human Rights Commission at (217)785-4350. Remedies available
through the Human Rights Department and Human Rights Commission in case of a
valid substantiated complaint may include, but are not limited to:



         (a)   Cease and desist orders;



         (b)   Actual damages;



         (c)   Hiring, reinstatement, promotion, back pay and
employee benefits;



         (d)   Attorney’s fees and costs;



         (e)   Compliance reports;



         (f)   Posting of compliance notices; and



         (g)   Loss of public contracts.



      (2)   Employees who file a complaint with the city, or the
Human Rights Department will not be retaliated against based on such
complaint. No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation. The State Officials and Employees Ethics Act
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action and retaliation is
a civil rights violation according to the Illinois Human Rights Act.



   (E)   This policy refers not only to supervisor/subordinate actions,
but also applies to action between co-workers. Harassment of our employees in
connection with their work by non-employees may also be a violation of this
policy. Any employee who becomes aware of any harassment of an employee by a
non-employee should report such harassment to his or her supervisor.
Appropriate action will be taken with respect to violation of this policy by
any non-employee.



   (F)   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be
applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, employee
handbooks and collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this
policy or the Prohibition of Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline
or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or
State or Federal agency.



   (G)   Making a false report is a violation of the city sexual
harassment policy. An employee knowingly making a false report will be
subject to discipline up to and including termination. In addition, any
person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act may be guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor and subject to an administrative fine.

written rebuttal statement to be placed in his or her file.



   (C)   Personnel files are kept confidential to the maximum extent
permitted by law. Except for routine verifications of employment, no

references on current or former regular city employees.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)

   (B)   A normal working schedule for regular, full-time employees
consists of 40 hours each work week. Different work schedules, such as in the

department head will advise the employee regarding their specific working
hours.



   (C)   Part-time and special assignment employees will work hours as
specified by their department heads.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)

   (A)   All city positions are designated as either “exempt” or
“non-exempt” according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”)
regulations. Whether an employee is classified as exempt of non-exempt
depends upon factors such as level of responsibility, prior knowledge and
experience, education level and pay structure. The City Manager will
determine how each position will be classified.



   (B)   For most city employees, the established work period is 40
hours within a seven-day work week. For law enforcement employees, the
established work period is 80 hours during a 14-day period.



   (C)   Non-exempt employees are entitled to additional compensation,
either in cash or compensatory time off, when they work more than 40 hours in
a seven-day work week.



   (D)   All overtime must be authorized in advance by the employee’s
department head.



   (E)   Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the
employee’s regular rate of pay for all time worked beyond the established
work period.



   (F)   When computing overtime, holidays, sick leave and vacation
time are not counted as hours worked.



   (G)   Exempt employees are not covered by the FLSA overtime
provisions and do not receive overtime pay.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.022  COMPENSATORY TIME.



   (A)   Non-exempt employees entitled to overtime pay may elect to
receive compensatory time off instead of cash payment. This is approved on a
case-by-case basis by the employee’s department head. If the compensatory
time option is exercised, the employee is credited with one and one-half
times the hours worked as overtime. Maximum accruals of compensatory time
shall be limited to 40 hours for regular employees. After maximum accrual,
overtime compensation shall be paid.



   (B)   Employees may use compensatory time within a reasonable time
period after making a request to their department head, unless doing so would
unduly disrupt city operations. Compensatory time should be used for
short-term absences from work during times mutually agreed to by the employee
and the department head. Accumulation of compensatory time to be used as a
substitute for extended vacation time off is not normally permitted.



   (C)   If an employee is unable to use accrued compensatory time
within a reasonable period, usually 90 days, the employee will be paid his or
her original overtime wage.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.023  ATTENDANCE.



   (A)   Punctual and consistent attendance is a condition of
employment. Each department head is responsible for maintaining an accurate
attendance record of his or her employees.



   (B)   Employees unable to work or unable to report to work on time
should notify their supervisor as soon as possible, ordinarily before the
work day begins or within 30 minutes of the employee’s usual starting time.
If an absence continues beyond one day, the employee is responsible for
reporting in each day. If the supervisor is unavailable, the employee may
leave a message with the City Manager’s office or Police Dispatch, stating
the reason for being late or unable to report for work.



   (C)   An employee who is absent without authorization or
notification is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.



   (D)   Employees who exhibit excessive absenteeism or tardiness are
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.024  BREAKS AND MEAL PERIODS.



   Employees may take one fifteen-minute break for every four hours
worked. All breaks shall be arranged so that they do not interfere with city
business or service to the public. Meal periods shall be scheduled by the
employee’s department head. The scheduling of meal periods may vary
depending on department workload. Meal periods are unpaid.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.025  CALL BACK.



   All employees are subject to call back in emergencies or as needed by
the city to provide necessary services to the public. A refusal to respond to
a call back will result in disciplinary action, including possible
termination. Employees called back to duty will be paid their appropriate
rate of pay for hours worked (two hours minimum.)



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.026  PAYROLL RECORDS.



   The official payroll records are kept by the City Clerk/Finance
Director. Each department head shall turn in on a regular basis a signed work
record for each employee within his or her department, noting hours worked,
leave taken and overtime worked during the previous pay period.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)




RECRUITING AND HIRING




§ 34.040  RECRUITING.



   (A)   Recruiting practices are conducted solely on the basis of
ability, merit, qualifications and competence, without regard to race, color,
religion, national origin, sex, marital status, pregnancy, age or disability.



   (B)   Each applicant shall complete and sign an application form
prior to being considered as a finalist for any position. Resumes may
supplement, but not replace, the city’s official application form.
Applicants chosen for consideration as finalists on the basis of their resume
or other information, shall complete a standard application form prior to
being considered as a finalist for any position.

will prepare and submit a written request to fill the position to the City
Manager. The position will be posted and/or advertised only after the City
Manager has approved the request.



   (B)   Residency within the city shall be a condition of initial
appointment. A resident outside the city may be considered if there are not
sufficient applicants. All employees should work toward becoming city
residents. Present employees that reside outside the city, must prove their
residence shall not interfere with the daily performance of their duties and
responsibilities.



   (C)   Applicants for positions in which the applicant is expected to

present a valid state driver’s license with any necessary endorsements.
Driving records of applicants may be checked. Applicants with poor driving
records, as determined by the city, may be disqualified for employment with
the city in positions requiring driving.



   (D)   The city may administer pre-employment examinations to test
the qualifications and ability of applicants, as determined necessary by the
city. The city may contract with any competent agency or individual to
prepare and/or administer examinations.



   (E)   After an offer of employment has been made and prior to
commencement of employment, the city may require persons selected for
employment to successfully pass a medical examination, which may include
testing for alcohol and controlled substances. The purpose of the examination
is to determine if the individual is physically able to perform the job and
to ensure their physical condition will not endanger the health, safety or
well-being of other employees or the public. The offer of employment may be
conditioned on the results of the examination.

      (2)   The candidate refuses to submit to a medical examination
or complete medical history forms; or



      (3)   If the exam reveals use of alcohol and/or controlled
substances.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.042  SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT EMPLOYEES.



   (A)   With approval of the department head, special assignment
employees may be used during emergencies or other peak workload periods, to
temporarily replace regular employees absent due to disability, illness,
vacation or other approved leave, or to temporarily fill a vacancy until a
regular employee is hired.



   (B)   Special assignment employees may be hired without competitive
recruitment or examination.



   (C)   Special assignment employees may not work more than 90 hours a
month for more than five months in a 12-month period.

worker’s compensation and previously advanced by the city. This policy is
to ensure that employees will receive prompt and regular payment during
periods of injury or disability so long as accrued sick leave is available,
while ensuring that no employee receives more than the employee would have
received had the injury not occurred. Upon the repayment of funds advanced,
the appropriate amount of sick leave shall be restored to the employee’s
account.

§ 34.140  SUBSTANCE ABUSE.



   (A)   The city may discipline or terminate an employee possessing,
consuming, controlling, selling or using alcohol, drugs or other controlled
substances during work hours. The city may also discipline or terminate an
employee who uses alcohol, drugs or other controlled substances which, in the
city’s opinion, impairs the employee’s work performance, poses a threat
to the public confidence, or is a safety risk to the city or others. The city
is committed to supporting employees who undergo treatment and rehabilitation
for alcohol or other chemical dependency before such use results in
unsatisfactory job performance or a situation where the employee is at work
with drugs or alcohol in their system.



   (B)   Employees who voluntarily report an alcohol, drug or
controlled substance dependency problem will not be subject to retaliation or
discrimination. Employees who voluntarily seek treatment may use sick leave
to attend a bona fide treatment or counseling program. The city may condition
continued employment on the employee’s successful completion of treatment
or counseling programs and future avoidance of alcohol, drugs or other
controlled substances.



   (C)   An employee may be required to submit to alcohol, drug or
controlled substance testing at any time in the city’s sole discretion.
Refusal to submit to testing, when requested, may result in immediate
disciplinary action, including termination. In addition, if any test reveals
the presence of any illegal drug or alcohol, the employee will be subject to
immediate discharge.



   (D)   Employees using any prescription or over the counter drugs
which might impair their work performance should notify their department
head. At the option of the department head, an employee may be reassigned to
less hazardous duty or be placed on sick leave if impaired work performance
might pose a threat to the public confidence or to the safety of the employee
or others.

§ 34.142  COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.



   (A)   The city recognizes that sometimes situations arise in which
an employee feels that they have not been treated fairly or in accordance
with city rules and procedures. For this reason, the city provides its
employees with procedures for resolving complaints.



   (B)   (1)   Step 1. An employee should first try to resolve any
problem or complaint with the supervisor.



      (2)   Step 2. When normal communication between an employee
and the supervisor is not successful, if the employee does not believe the
issue can be discussed with his or her supervisor, or when an employee
disagrees with the application of city policies and procedures, the employee
should attempt to resolve the problem with the department head. The
department head will respond to the employee in writing within five days
after meeting with the employee, if possible.



      (3)   Step 3. If the employee is not satisfied with the
response from the department head, the employee may submit the problem, in
writing, to the City Manager. The written complaint must contain, at a
minimum:



         (a)   A description of the problem;



         (b)   A specific policy or procedure which the employee
believes has been violated or misapplied;



         (c)   The date of the circumstances leading to the
complaint or the date when the employee first became aware of those
circumstances;



         (d)   The remedy sought by the employee to resolve the
complaint; and



         (e)   The written complaint should be filed within ten
working days of the occurrence leading to the complaint, or ten working days
after the employee becomes aware of the circumstances.



      (4)   The City Manager may meet with the parties, either
individually or together, and the City Manager will respond in writing to the
aggrieved employee, usually within ten days of the meeting. The City
Manager’s response and decision shall be final and binding.



      (5)   Certain employees may have more than one source of
dispute resolution rights (i.e., a collective bargaining agreement, if any)
and this complaint process. Employees represented by a bargaining unit should
follow grievance procedures set out in their respective labor contracts where
applicable. In all other cases, the procedures described in this section
shall be used. Under no circumstances shall an employee have the right to
utilize both this process and any other complaint or appeal procedure that
may be available to an employee.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)




DISCIPLINE AND TERMINATIONS




§ 34.155  DISCIPLINE.



   (A)   All employees are expected to exercise good judgment, loyalty,
common sense, dedication and courtesy in the performance of their duties. The
primary mission of every employee is to provide courteous, orderly, efficient
and economic delivery of services to the citizens of the city.



   (B)   Acts, errors or omissions which discredit the public service
or impair the provision of orderly services to the citizens of the city may
result in discipline, including termination.



   (C)   The City Manager or department head, as appropriate, has full
discretion and authority to impose disciplinary action in accordance with
city policy and the circumstances of the particular case.



   (D)   The following are examples of the types of behavior which may
result in discipline:



      (1)   Drinking alcohol or the abuse of non-prescription or
prescription drugs or other controlled substances on the job, or arriving on
the job or being at work while in possession of alcohol, drugs or other
controlled substances, or with alcohol or drugs in the employee’s system;



      (2)   Violation of a lawful duty;



      (3)   Insubordination;



      (4)   Absence from work without first notifying and securing
permission from the supervisor;



      (5)   Excessive absence or tardiness for any reason;



      (6)   Unsatisfactory job performance, as determined by the
city;



      (7)   Conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral
turpitude;



      (8)   Acceptance of fees, gratuities or other valuable items
in the performance of the employee’s official duties for the city;



      (9)   Inability, refusal or failure to perform the duties of
the assigned job; and



      (10)   Violation of duties or rules imposed by this manual, or
by any other city rule, regulation or administrative order.



   (E)   This list is not all-inclusive, but only serves as a general
guide. The city may discipline or terminate employees for other reasons not
stated above. In the event that discipline is necessary, the following types
of disciplinary actions may be used, depending on the particular situation:



      (1)   Oral warning. An oral warning is a counseling session
between the employee’s supervisor and the employee on the subject of the
employee’s conduct and performance, or their failure to observe a rule,
regulation or administrative instruction. It is intended to increase an
employee’s efficiency and value to the city by changing the employee’s
conduct, attitude, habits or work methods. Following the counseling session
the supervisor shall document the oral warning.



      (2)   Reprimand. A reprimand is a formal written disciplinary
action for misconduct, inadequate performance or repeated lesser infractions.
Written reprimands are placed in the employee’s personnel file.



      (3)   Suspension. A suspension is a temporary, unpaid absence
from duty which may be imposed as a penalty for significant misconduct or
repeated lesser infractions. A suspension is a severe disciplinary action
which is made part of the employee’s permanent record.



      (4)   Discharge. Depending upon all of the relevant
circumstances, including the nature of the conduct, and the employee’s
general record, an employee may be discharged for a single act of misconduct.



   (F)   Suspensions with pay, where the employee is placed on
administrative leave, may be utilized by the City Manager pending the results
of an investigation or disciplinary action where the City Manager determines
that factors such as public confidence, the safety of the employee or the
efficient functioning of the city call for such a suspension.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.156  TERMINATION.



   An employee may be terminated from city employment at any time, with or
without cause or advance notice. This includes situations where the City
Council or City Manager has made a determination that a lack of work or
funding exists with respect to the employee’s position.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.157  PRE-TERMINATION HEARING.



   In the case of termination of an employee, the city will conduct a
pre-termination hearing.



   (A)   In the event an appointing authority desires to terminate an
employee, the employee shall be provided with a notice of the recommendation
for termination. The notice shall include an explanation of the reasons on
which the recommendation is based, and the time and date for a
pre-termination hearing. If the employee fails or refuses to appear, the
termination may proceed.



   (B)   Pre-termination hearings will be presided over by the City
Manager or a designated representative.



   (C)   At the hearing, the employee may explain why the employee
should not be terminated. The employee may bring one person to the hearing as
an observer or representative. The City Manager shall determine who, if
anyone, may participate in the hearing, and how the hearing will be conducted.



   (D)   Usually within five working days after the pre-termination
hearing, the City Manager will issue a decision on whether the termination
will proceed, or whether lesser disciplinary action will be applied. However,
if the City Manager determines that more information or time is required in
order to render a decision, the City Manager may extend the time period as he
or she deems appropriate.



   (E)   The decision of the City Manager will be final.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)



§ 34.158  LAYOFF.



   (A)   The City Manager may lay off employees for lack of work,
budgetary restrictions or other changes that have taken place.



   (B)   Special assignment employees or employees who have not
completed their introductory period will be laid off before regular employees
are affected.



   (C)   In determining who is to be laid off, consideration will be
given to individual performance and the qualifications required for remaining
jobs. Length of service will be considered when performance and
qualifications are equal.



   (D)   Employees who are laid off may be eligible to be re-employed,
if a vacancy occurs in a position for which they are qualified. However, such
employee’s have no right to be recalled, and will be recalled only if the
city deems it to be in the city’s best interests at the time the recall
occurs.



(Ord. 2619, passed 7-8-2003)

processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code and
protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a

facilities and all TELECOMMUNICATIONS resold in the subsequent provision of,
used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications

§ 36.042  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the
taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts
owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under
this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

the lien shall remain in full force and effect.



   (B)   If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax
administrator shall:



      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the city’s expense;

(Ord. 2970, passed 5-8-2012)



§ 36.061  EXCEPTIONS.



   None of the taxes authorized by this subchapter may be imposed with
respect to any transaction in interstate commerce or otherwise to the extent
to which the business or privilege may not, under the Constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the state
or any political subdivision thereof; nor shall any persons engaged in the
business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling or transmitting
gas, water or electricity, or engaged in the business of transmitting
messages or using or consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail,
be subject to taxation under the provisions of this subchapter for those
transactions that are or may become subject to taxation under the provisions
of the Municipal Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act, being 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.3,
as authorized by 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; nor shall any tax authorized by this
subchapter be imposed upon any person engaged in a business or on any

delivers the electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt
of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser
and if unpaid, is recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for
delivering the electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this
subchapter and any such tax collected by a person delivering electricity
shall constitute a debt owed to the municipality by such person delivering
the electricity.  Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from
the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the
electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add
to such gross charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax to reimburse the person
delivering electricity for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing
customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data
to the municipality upon request. If the person delivering electricity fails
to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required
to pay the tax directly to the municipality in the manner prescribed by the
municipality. On or before the last day of each month, persons delivering
electricity shall make a return to the city for the preceding month and
shall, at the time of filing such return, pay the municipality the amount of
the tax collected pursuant to this subchapter.

enforcement of the recommendation or fine. Within 14 days after receiving the
demand, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon

other custodian is authorized to enter into an agreement with any such bank,
savings bank or savings and loan association, with any federally insured
financial institution or trust company, or with any agency of the United
States government relating to the deposit of such securities. Any such
treasurer or other custodian shall be discharged from responsibility for any
funds for which securities are so deposited with him or her, and the funds
for which securities are so deposited shall not be subject to any otherwise
applicable limitation as to amount.



   (B)   No bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association shall
receive public funds as permitted by this Section, unless it has complied
with the requirements established pursuant to § 6 of the Public Funds
Investment Act or is otherwise exempt from compliance as authorized by § 6.5
of that Act.

audit report shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the
water facilities, including a replacement cost. The financial information to
be shown in the audit report shall include the following:



      (1)   Flow data showing total gallons received at the water
plant for the current fiscal year;



      (2)   Billing data to show total number of gallons billed per
fiscal year;



      (3)   Debt service for the next succeeding fiscal year;



      (4)   Number of users connected to the system; and

Environmental Protection Agency or its authorized representatives shall have
access to any books, documents, papers and records of the city which are
applicable to the city system of user charges for the purpose of making
audit, examination excerpts and transcriptions thereof to ensure compliance

recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:



      (1)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 240
mg/l; and



      (2)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/l.



   (C)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and depreciation, and shall be computed as follows:



      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to
operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement
depreciation fund for the year, for all works categories;



      (2)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible;



      (3)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of
BOD to be treated;



      (4)   Proportion the estimated costs to non-industrial and
industrial users by volume, suspended solids and BOD;



      (5)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage
strength; and



      (6)   Compute surcharge costs per mg/l in excess of normal
sewage strength for BOD and SS.



   (D)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose BOD and SS
exceed 240 mg/l. The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 240 mg/l
and 240 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS, respectively. Section 52.094
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.



   (E)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the city in their
annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and
maintenance costs, including replacement costs.

treatment works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the publicly-owned treatment works;



      (3)   To protect both publicly-owned treatment works personnel
who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their
employment and the general public;



      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater
and sludge from the publicly- owned treatment works;



      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of
the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the publicly-owned
treatment works; and



      (6)   To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly-owned
treatment works is subject.



   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly-owned
treatment works. This chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge
permits; provides for monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.

§ 53.097  NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.



   (A)   (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and state’s hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or
other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of
the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months.



      (2)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection (A)
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 53.094 of this
chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 53.090, 53.092 and
53.093 of this chapter.



   (B)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more
than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.



   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Code
Enforcement Officer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director and the state’s hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of
such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.



   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.



   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit
issued thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.

   (A)   Except as indicated in subsection (B) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is feasible, the Code
Enforcement Officer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.



   (B)   Samples of oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compound must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

   Duly authorized employees of the city shall have the right to enter the
premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Code Enforcement Officer ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties.



   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the Code Enforcement Officer will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.



   (B)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.



   (C)   The Code Enforcement Officer may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their
accuracy.



   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Code Enforcement Officer and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the
user.



   (E)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Code Enforcement Officer
access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.



(2000 Code, § 53.100)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)  Penalty, see §
53.999



§ 53.116  SEARCH WARRANT.



   If the Code Enforcement Officer has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Code Enforcement
Officer may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES



§ 53.130  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.



   When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Code Enforcement Officer may serve upon that user a written
notice of violation. Within 14 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
by the user to the Code Enforcement Officer. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the Code Enforcement Officer to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.



(2000 Code, § 53.110)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.131  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.



   When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(2000 Code, § 53.111)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.132  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.



   (A)   When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations
are likely to recur, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(2000 Code, § 53.112)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.133  ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.



   (A)   (1)   When a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the user may be
fined in an amount not to exceed $500.



      (2)   Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis.



      (3)   In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.



      (4)   Said fine shall be calculated based on a 50% surcharge
of the user’s average daily water usage for each day the violation exists,
unless, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, the violation was
willful and did substantial harm to the system, in which case the maximum
fine shall be assessed for each day or part thereof for which the violation
existed.



      (5)   All said fines shall be billed with and be a part of the
user’s water and sewer bill.



   (B)    (1)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a
written request to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 15 days of being notified of the fine.



      (2)   Where a request has merit, the City Council may convene
a hearing on the matter.



      (3)   In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to
the user.



      (4)   The Code Enforcement Officer may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.



   (C)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(2000 Code, § 53.113)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.134  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.



   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer may immediately suspend a
user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.



   (B)   The Code Enforcement Officer may also immediately suspend a
user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may
present, an endangerment to the environment.



      (1)   (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its
discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event
of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Code Enforcement Officer may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals.



         (b)   The Code Enforcement Officer may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Code Enforcement Officer that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in § 53.135 of this chapter are initiated
against the user.



      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Code Enforcement Officer prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under § 53.135 of this
chapter.



(2000 Code, § 53.114)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.135  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.



   (A)   In addition to the provisions in § 53.075 of this chapter,
any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:



      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;



      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;



      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;



      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises
for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or



      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 53.020
through 53.024 of this chapter.



   (B)   (1)   Such user shall be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why
the proposed action should not be taken.



      (2)   Exercise of this option by the Code Enforcement Officer
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.

JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES



§ 53.150  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



   When the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the city may petition the Circuit Court through the City
Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Code Enforcement Officer may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a user.



(2000 Code, § 53.125)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.151  CIVIL PENALTIES.



   (A)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable
to the city for actual damages and the cost of repair or replacement of the
system.



   (B)   The city may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
city.



   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any
other factor as justice requires.



   (D)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.



(2000 Code, § 53.126)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.152  REMEDIES NON-EXCLUSIVE.



   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The city
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be
in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the city
may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.

SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION



§ 53.165  WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.



   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may
be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it
has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.



(2000 Code, § 53.135)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.166  PUBLIC NUISANCES.



   A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or
abated as directed by the Code Enforcement Officer. Any person(s) creating a
public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city code governing
such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in
removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.



(2000 Code, § 53.136)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 53.180  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless
or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (C) below, are met.



   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Code Enforcement Officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days):



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of non-compliance;



         (b)   The period of non-compliance, including exact
dates and times or, if corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is
expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.



   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.



(2000 Code, § 53.145)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.181  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for non- compliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.020(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §§ 53.020(B)
through 53.024 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:



   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.



(2000 Code, § 53.146)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.182  BY-PASS.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, BY-PASS means the
intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user’s
treatment facility. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a by-pass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A user may allow any by-pass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These by-passes are
not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) below.



   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a by-pass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Code Enforcement Officer, at least ten
days before the date of the by-pass, if possible.



      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Code Enforcement
Officer of an unanticipated by-pass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the by-pass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
user becomes aware of the by-pass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the by-pass and its cause; the duration of the by-pass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the by-pass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned
to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the by-pass. The Code
Enforcement Officer may waive the written report on a case-by- case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.



   (D)   (1)   By-pass is prohibited, and the Code Enforcement
Officer may take an enforcement action against a user for a by-pass, unless:



         (a)   By-pass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury or severe property damage;



         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the
by-pass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes or maintenance during normal period of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a by-pass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under
subsection (C) above.



      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer may approve an anticipated
by-pass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Code Enforcement
Officer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
subsection (D)(1) above.



(2000 Code, § 53.147)  (Ord. 2365, passed 1-10-1995)



§ 53.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500 per
violation, per day.



   (B)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at
least $500. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action
for personal injury or property damage available under state law.



   (C)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who
falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by
a fine of not more than $500 per violation, per day.

prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.



      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown
alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other

arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in § 70.17 of this chapter, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and
no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.



   (C)   Steady red indication.



      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (C)(3) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.



      (2)   Except as provided in subsection (C)(3) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the
intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.



      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and
the city authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation
prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may
cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a
one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by
subsections (C)(1) or (C)(2) above. After stopping, the driver shall yield
the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another
roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the
driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction or roadways.
The driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.



      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal
as provided in § 70.17 of this chapter, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.



   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable, except as to provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the
absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and
shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

“Don’t Walk” signal or upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady or
flashing.

in the lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present.

the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.

§ 71.001  SPEED LIMITS.



   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of the city at a
speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when
approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when
traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists
with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or
highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid
colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance
with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.



   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which
is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
subsections (C) and (D) below, by § 71.002 of this chapter or by a
regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.



   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in § 70.01
of this code of ordinances) for all vehicles is:



      (1)   Thirty mph; and



      (2)   Fifteen mph in an alley.



   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district shall be as
determined under 625 ILCS 5/11-601.

thereto that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity of the
motorized traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess
of 20 mph while passing a school zone, or while traveling upon any public
thoroughfare where children pass going to and from school.



   (C)   (1)   This section shall not be applicable unless
appropriate signs are posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located.
The signs shall give proper due warning that a school zone is being
approached, and shall indicate the school zone and the maximum speed limit in
effect during school days when school children are present.



      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of
electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special
school speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall
evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speed;
provided, the use of the device shall apply only to the enforcement of the
speed limit in the special school speed zone.



   (D)   (1)   When a fine for a violation of this section is $150
or greater, the person who violates the section shall be charged an
additional $50 to be paid to the unit school district where the violation
occurred for school safety purposes. If the violation occurred in a dual
school district, $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to the elementary school
district for school safety purposes and $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to
the high school district for school safety purposes. Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, the entire $50 surcharge shall be paid to the
appropriate school district or districts.



      (2)   For purposes of this section, SCHOOL SAFETY PURPOSES
include the costs associated with school zone safety education and the
purchase, installation and maintenance of caution lights which are mounted on
school speed zone signs.

street or highway in the city where the minimum allowable speed on that
street or highway, as posted, is greater than the maximum attainable
operating speed of the vehicle.



   (B)   Maximum attainable operating speed shall be determined by the
manufacturer of the vehicle and clearly published in the manual of
specifications and operation, or it shall be determined by applicable rule
and regulation promulgated by the Secretary of State.

or block the normal and regular movement of traffic, except when reduced
speed is necessary for safe operation of his or her vehicle or in compliance
with law.

left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of
the center of the intersection.



      (3)   The state’s Department of Transportation and local
authorities in their respective jurisdictions may cause official
traffic-control devices to be placed within or adjacent to intersections and
thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in
this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection, and when
such devices are so placed no driver of a vehicle shall turn a vehicle at an
intersection other than as directed and required by such devices.

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED



§ 71.080  OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN.



   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad
grade crossing, that person must exercise due care and caution as the
existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and
under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop
within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet, from the nearest rail of the
railroad, and shall not proceed until he can do so safely. The foregoing
requirements shall apply when:



      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device
gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train;



      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or
continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train;



      (3)   A railroad train approaching a highway crossing emits a
warning signal and the train, by reason of its speed or nearness to the
crossing, is an immediate hazard;



      (4)   An approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is
in hazardous proximity to the crossing; and/or



      (5)   A railroad train is approaching so closely that an
immediate hazard is created.

driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet,
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising
due care.



   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad
crossbuck signs, without automatic, electric or mechanical signal devices,
crossing gates, or a human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage
of a train, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable
for the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a
clearly marked stopped line or, if no stop line, within 50 feet, but not less
than 15 feet, from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed
until he or she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a
railroad crossing or interferes with the movement of a train after driving
past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima
facie evidence of the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way.

veteran with a disability under 625 ILCS 5/3-609 is in violation of this
section if:



         (a)   The person using the disability license plate or
parking decal or device is not the authorized holder of the disability
license plate or parking decal or device or is not transporting the
authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device
to or from the parking location; and

parking decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through the
disability license plate or parking decals or devices under this code.



      (4)   A driver of a vehicle displaying disability license
plates or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a
disability under 625 ILCS 5/3-616, 5/11-1301.1 or 5/11-1301.2 or to a veteran
with a disability under 625 ILCS 5/3-609 is in violation of this section if:

or private off-street parking facility may, after notifying the Police
Department, remove or cause to be removed to the nearest garage or other
place of safety any vehicle parked within a stall or space reserved for use
by a person with disabilities which does not display person with disabilities
registration plates or a special decal or device as required under this
section.



   (C)   (1)   Any person found guilty of violating the provisions
of this section shall be fined as set forth in § 72.99 of this chapter in
addition to any costs or charges connected with the removal or storage of any
motor vehicle authorized under this section.



      (2)   The city shall display signs indicating the fine
imposed, and if the amount of the fine is subsequently changed, the village
shall change the sign to indicate the current amount of the fine.



      (3)   It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section
that the sign posted pursuant to this section does not comply with the
technical requirements of 625 ILCS 5/11-1301, Department regulations or local
ordinance if a reasonable person would be made aware by the sign or notice on
or near the parking space that the place is reserved for a person with
disabilities.



   (D)   As used in this section, AUTHORIZED HOLDER means an individual
issued a person with disabilities license plate under 625 ILCS 5/3-616 or an
individual issued a person with disabilities parking decal or device under
625 ILCS 5/11-1302.2, or an individual issued a license plate for veterans

found that among persons who have ever tried a cigarette, more than 80%

cigarette smoking precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug
use.

   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:



      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her
conduct, described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is
consciously aware that his or her conduct is of such nature or that such
circumstances exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the
substantial probability that the fact exists; and/or

not to exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted. If such fine
exceeds that set forth in § 130.99 of this chapter, however, the city shall
enforce said offense under the provisions of state law.

   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in
a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals
under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property
in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in
determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes
flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or
herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.
Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a
police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section,
afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be
warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to
explain his or her presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an
offense under this section if the police officer did not comply with the
preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by
the person was true and, if it had been believed by the police officer at the
time, would have dispelled the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any
person suspected of being a loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it
reasonably appears that the delay in arresting the suspect caused by
obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect’s escape.



   (B)   (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first
being warned by a police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs
have been posted, to loiter, stand, sit or lie in or upon any public or
quasi- public sidewalk, street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that
portion of private property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or
obstruct unreasonably the free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon.



      (2)   It shall be unlawful for any person to block, obstruct
or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open to the public.



   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACEis an area
generally visible to public view, including streets, sidewalks, bridges,
alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles (whether moving
or not), and buildings open to the general public, including those which
serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances
to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

(720 ILCS 5/11-30)  (2000 Code, § 134.01)  Penalty, see § 130.99



§ 134.02  OBSCENITY.



   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content
thereof, he or she:



      (1)   Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to
sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other
representation or embodiment of the obscene;



      (2)   Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other
performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it
obscene;



      (3)   Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available

      (4)   Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene

the penal laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or



      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material
represented or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is
obscene.



   (B)   “Obscene” defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE
if:



      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the
prurient interest;



      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether
normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory
functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and



      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.



   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.



      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary
adults; except that, it shall be judged with reference to children or other
specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the
material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed
for or directed to such an audience.



      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.



      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section,
evidence shall be admissible to show:



         (a)   The character of the audience for which the
material was designed or to which it was directed;



         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would
be for ordinary adults or a special audience and what effect, if any, it
would probably have on the behavior of such people;



         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or
other merits of the material or absence thereof;



         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the
material in this state;



         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof,
in advertising or other promotion of the material; and



         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or
disseminator.



   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.



   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to
obscenity that the dissemination:



      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates
other than children under 18 years of age; and/or



      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or
other special justification for possession of such material.



(720 ILCS 5/11-20)  (2000 Code, § 134.02)  Penalty, see § 130.99



§ 134.03  HARMFUL MATERIAL.



   (A)   Elements of the offense. No person, with knowledge that a
person is a child (that is, a person under 18 years of age), or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, shall
knowingly distribute to, send or cause to be sent to, or exhibit to, or offer
to distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child.



   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



      DISTRIBUTE. To transfer possession of, whether with or without
consideration.



      HARMFUL. Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or
excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.



      KNOWINGLY. Having knowledge of the contents of the subject
matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would
have disclosed the contents thereof.



      MATERIAL. Any writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment.



   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.



      (1)   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the
material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same
general age of the child to whom the material was offered, distributed, sent
or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is
designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant
appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or
probable recipient group.



      (2)   In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances
of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance
of the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.



   (D)   Affirmative defenses.



      (1)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public
library or any library operated by an accredited institution of higher
education from circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of
age; provided, such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or
educational purpose; and it shall be an affirmative defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this section that the act charged was
committed in aid of legitimate scientific or educational purposes.



      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from
distributing to his child any harmful material.



      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted
in reliance upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a
child, shall be a defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: a
document issued by the federal government or any state, county or city
government or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a
motor vehicle operator’s license, a registration certificate issued under
the Federal Selective Service Act, being 50 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., or an
identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.



      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as
defined in this section culminates in the sale or distribution of harmful
material to a child, under circumstances where there was no personal
confrontation of the child by the defendant, his or her employees, or agents,
as where the order or request for harmful material was transmitted by mail,
telephone or similar means of communication, and delivery of the harmful
material to the child was by mail, freight or similar means of transport, it
shall be a defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that
the advertisement contained the following statement, or a statement
substantially similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser
to certify that he or she was not under 18 years of age and that the
purchaser falsely stated that he or she was not under 18 years of age:



         “NOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of
age to purchase the matter herein advertised. Any person under 18 years of
age who falsely states that he is not under 18 years of age for the purpose
of obtaining the material advertised herein, is guilty of a Class B
misdemeanor under the laws of the State of Illinois and a violation of §
134.03 of the City Code of Ordinances.”



   (E)   Child falsifying age. No person under 18 years of age shall
falsely state, either orally or in writing, that he or she is not under the
age of 18 years, or present or offer to any person any evidence of age and
identity which is false or not actually his or her own for the purpose of
ordering, obtaining, viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure
or view any harmful material.

any place open to the public view unless such person is adequately garbed in

zone lot or other premises on which exists a sign that does not conform with
the requirements of this chapter or for which there is no current and valid
sign permit shall be obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of a
non-conforming sign, to bring it into conformity with the requirements of
this chapter.



   (B)   Signs existing on effective date. For any sign existing in the
city on 4-9-2013, the effective date of this chapter, an application for a
sign permit must be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer before six
months after the effective date of this chapter. For any sign on property
annexed at a later date, applications for sign permits shall be submitted
within six months of the effective date of the annexation or within such
period as may be established in an annexation agreement between the city and
the landowner. Signs that are the subject of applications received after the
applicable date set forth in this section shall be subject to all the terms
and conditions of this chapter and shall not be entitled to the protection of
this subsection (B). Applications for permits for existing signs submitted
before six months after the effective date of this chapter shall be exempt
from the initial fees adopted under the authority of this chapter, but not
from renewal or subsequent fees.



   (C)   Non-conforming existing signs, permits and terms. A sign that
would be permitted under this chapter only with a sign permit, but which was
in existence on 4-9-2013, the effective date of this chapter, or on a later
date when the property is annexed to the city, and which was constructed in
accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the
date of its construction, but which by reason of its size, height, location,
design or construction is not in conformance with the requirements of this
chapter, shall be issued a non-conforming sign permit if an application in
accordance with subsection (A) above is timely filed. Such permit shall allow
the sign(s) subject to such permit, which were made non-conforming by the
adoption of this chapter, to remain in place and be maintained for a period
ending no later than ten years after the effective date of this chapter;
provided that, no action is taken which increases the degree or extend of the
non-conformity. Such signs are also subject to the provisions of this
subsection (C). A change in the information on the face of an existing
non-conforming sign is allowed. However, any non-conforming sign shall either
be eliminated or made to conform with the requirements of this section when
any proposed change, repair or maintenance would constitute an expense of
more than 25% of the lesser of the original value or replacement value of the
sign.



   (D)   Lapse of non-conforming sign permit. A non-conforming sign
permit shall lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those
under which any other sign permit may lapse and become void.

forthwith removed without notice or action from the city.

DIVISION 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 153.0001  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The Unified Development Code (UDC) is designed to implement
and be consistent with the goals, objectives, policies and strategies of the
adopted Comprehensive Plan through complete, integrated, effective and
concise land development regulations.



   (B)   The zoning and land-use regulations set forth in Divisions 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 of this chapter promote the public health, safety, morals or
general welfare of the state, the region and the local government, and
protect and preserve places and areas of historical, cultural, architectural
or environmental importance and significance.



   (C)   The subdivision regulations set forth in Divisions 7, 8, 9 and
10 of this chapter promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of
the local government and the safe, orderly and healthful development of the
local government, taking into account all factors both on and off the site of
the subdivision. The processing procedures set forth in Divisions 8, 9 and 10
of this chapter consolidate regulations governing the processing of approvals
for the development of land. They ensure that notification and procedures
comply with state law, provide ample opportunity for public participation in
the land development process, provide for the efficient and timely processing
of development approvals, and promote the readability of the document for the
general public and for applicants requesting development approvals.



   (D)   The development standards in Divisions 11, 12, 13 and 14 of
this chapter consolidate the substantive standards relating to the issuance
of development approvals for zoning and subdivision approval in order to
provide clarity and certainty in the development approval process.



   (E)   Division 15 of this chapter ties development approval to
designated infrastructure level of service standards as set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan, master utility plans, regional and area-wide standards,
state statutes or other applicable documents or policies.



   (F)   Division 16 of this chapter provides specific development
standards for designated uses. These establish supplemental conditions that
protect the public while establishing predictable standards for the applicant.



   (G)   Divisions 17 and 18 of this chapter protects legal
non-conforming uses and vested rights in accordance with state and federal
decisional and statutory law.



   (H)   Division 19 of this chapter establishes various administrative
agencies involved in the development approval process, as well as the role of
administrative and legislative bodies.



   (I)   Definitions are established in § 153.0008 of this chapter.



   (J)   Division 20 of this chapter is established to provide guidance
to applicants in the submittal of development approval applications, to avoid
the unnecessary expenditure of public resources for the processing of
incomplete applications, and to avoid unnecessary delay in the approval of
applications for development approval.

§ 153.0002  CITATION.



   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Unified
Development Code of the City of Greenville”.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0003  AUTHORITY.



   The UDC is authorized by the following: Illinois Municipal Code, 65
ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0004  APPLICABILITY.



   This chapter applies to all buildings, structures, lands and uses over
which the city has jurisdiction under the constitution and law(s) of the
state and of the United States.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013; Ord. 3026, passed 12-10-2013)



§ 153.0005  CONSISTENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.



   (A)   The UDC is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. Any
amendments to this chapter, including, but not limited to, rezoning approval
pursuant to Division 8 of this chapter and all development approvals, shall
be consistent with the following:



      (1)   The adopted Comprehensive Plan, as it may be amended
from time to time, in effect at the time of the request for amendment; and



      (2)   Any neighborhood, area or specific plan adopted pursuant
to Division 8 of this chapter.



   (B)   An amendment to the text of the UDC is consistent and in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan if it complies with the goals,
objectives, policies and strategies and any vision statement contained in the
Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0006  COORDINATION WITH OTHER REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Generally. The use of buildings and land within the city is
subject to all other regulations as well as the UDC, whether or not such
other provisions are specifically referenced in the UDC. References to other
regulations or provisions of the UDC are for the convenience of the reader.
The lack of a cross-reference does not exempt a land, building, structure or
use from other regulations.



   (B)   Zoning. If a regulation adopted by the UDC requires a greater
width or size of a yard, court or other open space; requires a lower building
height or fewer number of stories for a building; requires a greater
percentage of lot to be left unoccupied; or otherwise imposes higher
standards than those required under another statute or local ordinance or
regulation, the regulation adopted under the UDC controls. If the other
statute or local ordinance or regulation imposes higher standards, that
statute, ordinance or regulation controls.



   (C)   Rules of construction.



      (1)   Interpretation and application of the UDC are the basic
and minimum requirements for the protection of public health, safety,
comfort, morals, convenience, prosperity and welfare. The UDC shall be
liberally interpreted in order to further its underlying purposes. The
meaning of any and all words, terms or phrases in the UDC shall be construed
in accordance with § 153.0008 of this chapter.



      (2)   The UDC contains numerous graphics, pictures,
illustrations and drawings in order to assist the reader in understanding and
applying the UDC. However, to the extent that there is any inconsistency
between the text of the UDC and any such graphic, picture, illustration or
drawing, the text controls unless otherwise provided in the specific section.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0007  DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS.



   No development activity shall occur on any property within the
jurisdiction of the UDC until an applicable development approval for the
activity has been granted. (Refer to Division 7 of this chapter.)



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0008  RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   (1)   Words, phrases and terms defined in the Unified
Development Code (UDC) shall be given the defined meaning as set forth below.
Words, phrases and terms not defined in the UDC shall be given their usual

statement of legislative finding or purpose. The “purpose and findings”
statements are legislatively adopted, together with the formal text of the
UDC. They are intended as a guide to the administration and interpretation of
the UDC and shall be treated in the same manner as other aspects of
legislative history. However, they are not binding standards.



      (7)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of the UDC are considered minimal in nature. Whenever the provisions,
standards or requirements of any other applicable division of the UDC are
higher or more restrictive, the latter shall control.



      (8)   In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by
this section, the day of the notice or final application, after which the

DIVISION 2: USE PATTERNS



GENERALLY



§ 153.0025  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   (1)   This chapter establishes design templates for certain
types of development. The procedures for permitting such activities are also
described. The purpose is to consolidate the various aspects of the Unified
Development Code (UDC) applicable to these activities in order to improve the
readability of the UDC and, in some cases, to encourage certain types of
development. Each section in this division describes the use pattern, the
procedure for approval and the standards relating to approval, with
cross-references to other parts of this chapter where needed.



      (2)   The intent is to present a visual, user-friendly
overview of the regulations that apply to those types of uses or development
styles.



   (B)   The use patterns established in this division are not zoning
districts, overlay zoning districts or special zoning districts. Instead,
they are forms of development that may be permitted in the various zoning
districts established by the UDC. The use patterns typically involve multiple
uses on the same property. They are described here and in the base zoning
district regulations ( Table 153.0202(A) of this chapter) as a land-use
activity in order to trigger the appropriate development approval process.
Some multiple-use developments, such as “PD” (Planned Development)
Districts (see § 153.0184 of this chapter), are permitted through a special
or overlay zoning district. However, a planned development is not a land-use
activity, but rather a procedure for providing design flexibility. By
contrast, the use patterns are specific land-use activities involving
land-use and design controls that produce a distinct pattern of development.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.0)



§ 153.0026  APPLICABILITY.



   This section applies to any application where the applicant chooses to
develop pursuant to the standards and procedures of a use pattern described
in this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.1)



CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION



§ 153.0040  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS; APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility in site
design in order to allow developers to preserve common open space and natural
resources. The specific purposes of this section are to:



      (1)   Protect the public health, safety and general welfare by
avoiding surface and ground water pollution, contaminated run-off, air
quality contamination and urban heat islands that result from pavement and
the clearing of natural vegetation;



      (2)   Protect and preserve natural resources, such as
wetlands, streams, lakes, steep slopes, woodlands and water recharge areas;



      (3)   Reduce infrastructure and housing costs by reducing the
engineering and construction costs produced by conventional subdivision
design, which requires more pavement, wetland crossings, grading of trees and
natural areas and maintenance from lawn and landscaping maintenance;



      (4)   Protect property values by allowing open space design
features that enhance the marketability of development;



      (5)   Provide design flexibility; and



      (6)   Promote development on soils that are most suitable for
urban densities while preserving soils that are primarily adaptable to other
uses, such as woodlands, wildlife habitat and agriculture.



   (B)   A conservation subdivision (see Figure 153.0040(A) below) is
permitted in any zoning district excluding the following: “D” (Downtown),
“IL” (Industrial Light), “IH” (Industrial Heavy) or “MX” (Mixed
Use).







Figure 153.0040(A): Conservation Subdivisions



   Conservation subdivisions (left) feature smaller lots with a high
percentage of open space. Conventional subdivisions (right) feature large
lots with little common open space. A conventional subdivision is subject to
all of the base zoning district standards, such as minimum lot size, front
setbacks, landscaping and adequacy of public facilities.

Attached eyebrow homes
 
An eyebrow street includes dwellings fronting a street that surrounds a
close. The eyebrow street configuration may be used for duplexes or
triplexes. The close shall include a landscaped island or a natural area that
contains the same planting density as a Type N buffer (see §§ 153.1120
through 153.1130 of this chapter).


Attached homes with automobile courtyards, park circle or private parking
courts
 
This pattern is similar to the private courtyard scheme in that it provides a
turnaround circle with a small park or open space area. The common area for
the automobile-courtyard configuration contains parking.


Attached homes with private parking courts
 
This configuration involves townhouse groups with up to 8 units in a row.


Detached “Z” lot homes
 
Detached “Z” lot homes are aligned along the diagonal axis of the lot,
either perpendicular to the street or at an angle. The minimum side setback
requirements shall not apply.


Detached eyebrow homes
 
As an alternative to the cul-de-sac scheme, this configuration groups homes
around a common green area with 2 access points.


Detached homes with commons
 
This approach to clustering emphasizes open space by orienting the front
doors of houses to a formal common area. The common area may include a
greenway, close, playground, green, park or parkway as set forth in §
153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter. Cottage homes are small homes
built around common, private open space, typically on smaller tracts. Cottage
homes must conform to the requirements of § 153.1372 of this chapter.


Detached homes with shared courtyards
 
A courtyard is an open area adjacent to, or part of, a group of residential
buildings. Courtyards function as gathering places and may incorporate a
variety of non-permanent activities, such as vendors and display stands. See
§§ 153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter for standards applicable to
courtyards.


Detached homes with shared driveways
 
This pattern permits the grouping of up to 4 homes on a shared driveway. The
driveway is limited to 50 feet in length.


Detached patio homes
 
A patio home or garden home is a single-family residential structure of 1 or
2 stories, which is constructed in such a manner that one, but not both, of
the side exterior walls is constructed along 1 of the side property lines of
each lot. The side setback shall be waived on 1 side of the property line.


Detached wide-shallow lot homes
 
A wide-shallow lot has a frontage and lot width that exceeds its depth. The
rear setback shall be waived for wide-shallow lot configurations.


Single-family attached and multi-family stacked homes with park square
 
This configuration involves a combination of single-family dwellings,
duplexes, row houses or multi-family dwellings facing a square, green or
plaza.


Single-family attached homes with mid-rise cluster
 
This configuration includes a mix of townhouses with not more than 1
apartment per block. The apartment frontage shall not exceed 200 feet.


Single-family detached and attached homes in a traditional block
 
This option includes a mix of single-family detached dwellings and townhouses
or row houses fronting local streets with a connectivity ratio (see §
153.1068 of this chapter) of at least 1.8. Access shall be from a rear alley.


Single-family detached homes
 
This is a single-family dwelling that is not attached to any other dwelling
by any means and is surrounded by open space or yards.


Stacked and attached homes with parking courts
 
Angled stacked and attached homes are multi-family dwellings with at least 2
stories in height and aligned with a horizontal curve or “L”
configuration. The dwellings shall contain porches facing a walkway,
courtyard with parking or common open space.


Stacked quadrangle homes
 
Quadrangles are multi-family dwellings with at least 2 stories arranged in a
continuous, rectangular form with an inner courtyard.


Traditional neighborhood cluster street
 
This option includes a mix of single-family detached dwellings and townhouses
or row houses fronting local streets with a connectivity ratio (see §
153.1068 of this chapter) of at least 1.8. At least 50% of the blocks shall
contain an eyebrow street with a close. The close shall include a landscaped
island or a natural area that contains the same planting density as a Type N
buffer (see §§ 153.1120 through 153.1130 of this chapter).

TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT



§ 153.0130  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS; APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   The traditional neighborhood development (TND) option (see
Figure 153.0130(A) below) is designed to permit the development of land in a
manner consistent with the historic and timeless principles of the city’s
existing neighborhoods. A TND combines a variety of housing types with
commercial and civic uses in a compact, walkable neighborhood setting. TNDs
feature a highly interconnected street network and setbacks appropriate to
create a public realm built on a human scale. The street network should
recognize a site’s topography and other natural features. A TND may not be
appropriate where severe environmental constraints, such as steep slopes,
wetlands or streams, preclude street interconnections and high-impervious
surface coverage.







Figure 153.0130(A): Traditional Neighborhood Development



   (B)   A TND may be approved in any of the following zoning
districts: “NS” (Neighborhood Suburban), “NU” (Neighborhood Urban),
“O” (Office), “CN” (Commercial Neighborhood), “CG” (Commercial
General), “CL” (Commercial Large-Scale) or “MX” (Mixed Use).



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.6.1)



§ 153.0131  PROCESSING PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Generally. There are two procedures for approval of a TND.



      (1)   The TND may be approved administratively with a combined
subdivision plat and master site plan.



      (2)   Where the existing zoning classification does not permit
a TND, the applicant may request a rezoning to an “MX” (Mixed Use) zoning
district.



   (B)   Combined subdivision plats and site plans. Applications for
subdivision approval in any of the districts in which a TND is permitted may
file a combined subdivision plat and master site plan that complies with the
standards of this section and other applicable provisions of the UDC. Such
applications shall be labeled “TND Subdivision” and may be processed and
approved in accordance with the master site plan procedures and the
subdivision plat procedures set forth in Division 7 of this chapter.



   (C)   Neighborhood meetings. A neighborhood participation meeting
(§§ 153.0610 through 153.0612  of this chapter) is mandatory for a TND.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.6.2)



§ 153.0132  SIZE AND LOCATION OF SITE.



   (A)   Location.



      (1)   A TND may be located adjacent to, but shall not be
bisected by, a secondary arterial or primary arterial street unless the
street is designed to conform to the requirements of an avenue or main
street. (See §§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of this chapter.)



      (2)   If the TND is located adjacent to a collector or
higher-classification street, and the street is not designed to conform to
the standards of an avenue or main street, the following criteria shall apply:



         (a)   The internal streets providing access to the TND
shall be aligned perpendicular to the collector or higher-order street; and



         (b)   The buildings or structures that take access from
the internal streets shall face the internal streets and not the collector or
higher-order streets.



   (B)   Subareas. The site shall be divided into the following
subareas:



      (1)   A center consisting of civic, retail, service and
multi-family uses: the size of the center is based on the size of the entire
site, as provided in subsection (C) below;



      (2)   A neighborhood or series of neighborhoods consisting of
multi-family and single-family uses, small-scale retail and service uses, and
public outdoor gathering places: it is the intent of this chapter that all
areas within a neighborhood are within a five-minute walking distance from
edge to edge. A neighborhood shall be at least ten and no more than 40 acres
in size. This land area does not include greenbelts; and



      (3)   Parks and open space, including a plaza and a greenbelt:
the plaza provides a community focal point and public gathering place, while
the greenbelt provides a clear edge to the community, open space for
community residents, and natural areas for storm water management. (See §§
153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter.)



   (C)   Centers. The center shall have a minimum area of 30,000 square
feet. For a TND exceeding 250 dwelling units, the TND shall have a minimum
area of 120 square feet per dwelling unit.



      (1)   A center shall only be located on a main street. (See
§§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of this chapter.)



      (2)   The center may face or surround the plaza or square.



      (3)   A continuous system of sidewalks shall connect the
center with streets and lanes that provide access to dwelling units (e.g., a
proposed TND has 600 dwelling units; the minimum square footage for the
center is 600 x 120, or 72,000 square feet).



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.6.3)



§ 153.0133  USES AND DENSITY.



   (A)   Density. The requested densities, in terms of number of units
per gross residential acre and total number of dwelling units, shall be set
forth in the subdivision and/or master site plan application. The subdivision
plat or master site plan for a TND shall comply with Table 153.0133(A) below.

(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.6.4)



§ 153.0134  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES.



   The city finds that the proximity of jobs and retail uses to housing in
a TND development can achieve significant trip reductions produced by the
internal capture of home-work and home-retail trips. The city further finds
and determines that there is a compelling public interest to encourage new
development to occur in accordance with the criteria set forth in this
section. Accordingly, a TND subdivision plat or master site plan are not
required to file a traffic impact analysis (TIA) pursuant to the adequate
public facilities standards (Division 15 of this chapter).



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.6.5)

For a proposed TND not exceeding 80 acres in size, at least 90% of the
dwelling units shall be located within a five-minute walk (1,320 feet) from
the perimeter of a plaza. For a proposed TND that is at least 80 acres in
size, at least 50% of the dwelling units shall be located within a

TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT



§ 153.0155  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS; APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   (1)   The transit-oriented development (TOD) zone
encourages a mixture of residential, commercial and employment opportunities
within identified light rail station areas or other high-capacity transit
areas. The use pattern is intended to encourage a mixture of residential,
commercial and employment opportunities within transit corridors or areas
served by transit. This district is intended to promote transit-supportive
development, to ensure access to transit, and to limit conflicts between
vehicles and pedestrians and transit operations. The zone allows for a more
intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual
reinforcement of public investments and private development. Uses and
development are regulated to create a more intense built-up environment that
is oriented to pedestrians and to provide a density and intensity that is
transit supportive.



      (2)   The development standards of the zone are also designed
to encourage a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment near transit stations
by encouraging an intensive area of shops and activities; by encouraging
amenities, such as benches, kiosks and outdoor cafes; and by limiting
conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. district be restricted to areas
within 1/2 mile of a transit station, which is equivalent to a ten-minute
walking distance.



   (B)   The provisions of this section apply to any use or development
located within a TOD. (See Figure 153.0157(A).)



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.7.1)



§ 153.0156  PROCESSING PROCEDURES.



   Development consistent with this section may occur as of right in any
“MX” (Mixed Use) District.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.7.2)



§ 153.0157  SIZE AND LOCATION OF SITE.



   (A)   Generally. The TOD shall be divided into two subdistricts
known as the TOD core (TOD-C) and the TOD periphery (TOD-P), which shall be
considered separate zoning districts subject to the requirements set forth in
this section. The requirements of this section shall apply to both the TOD-C
and TOD-P subdistricts, unless otherwise provided. Following any rezoning to
an “MX” (Mixed Use) district, the official zoning map shall be amended to
denote the subdistricts as defined in subsection (B) below.







Figure 153.0157(A): Transit-Oriented Development



   (B)   Locational criteria.



      (1)   All areas within one-fourth mile of a transit station or
major bus boarding location shall be classified as TOD-C.



      (2)   All areas between one-fourth mile and one-half mile from
a transit station or major bus boarding location shall be classified as
TOD-P. No land area shall be zoned TOD-P unless it adjoins an area zoned
TOD-C.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 2.7.3)



§ 153.0158  USES AND DENSITY.



   (A)   Because most transit users will walk only one-fourth to
one-half mile to a transit facility, transit influence areas require high
densities on small areas of land. The city finds that uses inconsistent with
transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a
TOD, and may render the transit system unworkable. Accordingly, the uses
permitted within the TOD zoning districts are those that are dependent upon,
or which may generate, a relatively high level of transit usage. Uses that
interfere with transit usage and that generate few transit trips are not
permitted. Further, the city finds and determines that minimum levels of
density as set forth in this section are required to support transit
ridership, and that lower levels of density will not support transit
ridership and will create unacceptable levels of vehicular congestion.



   (B)   Permitted, conditional and prohibited uses shall comply with
the use matrix ( Table 153.0202(A) of this chapter). The requested densities,
in terms of number of units per gross residential acre and total number of
dwelling units, shall be set forth in the application. The application shall
comply with Table 153.0158(A) below.

DIVISION 3: INTRODUCTION OF DISTRICTS



§ 153.0180  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS; INTRODUCTION.



   (A)   This chapter establishes zoning districts and describes the
use and design regulations that apply to each district. Several types of
zoning districts are established:



      (1)   Division 4: base zoning districts establishes districts
that divide the local government into various residential, commercial and
industrial zones. Each district establishes uses that are permitted “as of
right” and as a conditional use. A use permitted as of right is compatible
with the other uses within the purpose of the district and therefore requires
only administrative approval. Conditional uses require a public hearing to
assess whether conditions are needed in order to make the use compatible with
other uses in the district;



      (2)   Division 5: overlay zoning districts establishes
districts within which the standards of both the base and overlay zoning
districts apply. These districts address special situations that require
additional regulations to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare;



      (3)   Division 6: flexible zoning establishes incentives in
the form of additional density and other regulatory measures in order to
encourage the provision of affordable housing, the preservation of
environmental resources, the dedication of rights-of-way for arterial
streets, and the redevelopment of underutilized sites. Landowners are
permitted through rezoning to transfer densities from sites that are
inappropriate for development to sites that are suitable for increases in
density; and



      (4)   The “supplemental use regulations” in Division 16
establish regulations for some uses that are permitted in a zoning district,
but raise special concerns that require additional uniform regulations. The
regulations set forth apply regardless of whether the use is permitted as of
right or as a conditional use within the district.



   (B)   (1)   Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-13, the purpose of this
section is to promote the public health, safety, morals or general welfare,
and to protect and preserve places and areas of historical, cultural or
architectural importance and significance. These regulations are adopted in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and are designed to:



         (a)   Lessen congestion in the streets;



         (b)   Secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;



         (c)   Promote health and general welfare;



         (d)   Provide adequate light and air;



         (e)   Prevent the overcrowding of land;



         (f)   Avoid an undue concentration of population; or



         (g)   Facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewers, schools, parks and other public requirements.



      (2)   Consistent with the goals and objectives listed in the
Comprehensive Plan, these regulations are designed to foster the following
subsidiary purposes:



         (a)   Distribute land uses to meet the physical, social,
cultural, economic and energy needs of present and future populations;



         (b)   Ensure that new development is compatible with
surrounding development in use, character and size;



         (c)   Provide for land uses that serve important public
needs, such as affordable housing and employment generators;



         (d)   Promote mixed-use buildings and mixed-use
neighborhoods;



         (e)   Promote infill housing and downtown retail and
residential development;



         (f)   Integrate civic uses into neighborhoods;



         (g)   Protect natural resources; and



         (h)   Encourage retail development in urban,
neighborhood and regional centers, including the historic downtown and
“main street”.



      (3)   In accordance with the foregoing purposes, this section
establishes regulations governing the following:



         (a)   The height, number of stories and size of
buildings and other structures;



         (b)   The percentage of a lot that may be occupied;



         (c)   The size of yards, courts and other open spaces;



         (d)   Population density; and



         (e)   The location and use of buildings, other
structures and land for business, industrial, residential or other purposes.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.0)



§ 153.0181  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   No land shall be used or occupied and no structures shall be
designed, erected, altered, used or occupied, except in conformity with all
of the regulations, compliance with all design standards and upon performance
of all conditions attached to any special or conditional use permit (CUP),
variance, appeal, conditional rezoning, planned development rezoning or
master site plan approved pursuant to this chapter.



   (B)   No person, firm or corporation and no officer or employee
(either as owner or as participating principal, agent, servant or employee of
such owner) shall sell, rent or lease, or offer or attempt to sell, rent or
lease, any land or structure upon the representation, falsely made and known
to be false, that such land or structure may be used or occupied in a manner

§ 153.0182  ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.



   (A)   Area system.



      (1)   The city finds that its rural, suburban, and urban areas
have substantially different physical, geographic and functional
characteristics that require alternative regulatory treatment. Rural areas
are largely undeveloped and are characterized by woodlands, agricultural
lands, horse farms and scattered residential and commercial uses at very low
densities. Suburban areas are automobile oriented, with auto-medium
densities, front-loaded garages and separate commercial areas. Residents of
suburban neighborhoods desire a living environment that favors the values of
security and privacy. Urban neighborhoods are more compact and pedestrian
friendly, reflecting traditional community character and architecture.
Residents of urban neighborhoods prefer a strong sense of community and a
mixed-use living environment.



      (2)   A rural area, a suburban area and a traditional area are
established by this section in order to provide a framework for assigning
land-use categories, zoning districts and development standards. The areas
are shown on the official zoning map.



   (B)   Base zoning districts. The city is divided into the zoning
districts shown in Table 153.0182(A) below.



   (C)   Overlay zoning districts. The city establishes the overlay
zoning districts set out in Table 153.0182(B) below. These impose additional
requirements on certain properties within one or more underlying base or
conditional zoning districts.



   (D)   Conditional zoning districts. See §§ 153.0680 through
153.0689 of this chapter.

   (E)   Floating zones. Floating zones are established in Table
153.0182(C) below in order to establish a process and standards for the
siting of uses that have unique neighborhood, environmental or design
impacts, and have not been previously identified on the official zoning map,
and that require individual, legislative approval in order to establish
appropriate standards. The sections of Division 16 of this chapter referenced
in Table 153.0182(C) below establish the permitted uses within the applicable
floating zone and constitute the standards for the district.

   (F)   Zoning districts (additional). Additional zoning districts may
be added from time to time upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission
to the City Council pursuant to §§ 153.0660 through 153.0669 of this
chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.2; Ord. 3156, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.0183  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.



   (A)   The maps delineating the boundaries of the various zoning
districts, together with all matters and things shown on such maps, are
adopted and approved, and collectively constitute the “official zoning
map”. The official zoning map is incorporated by reference and made a part
of this chapter. These maps are on file in the office of Code Enforcement and
in the office of the City Clerk/Finance Director and on the city’s website,
www.greenvilleillinois.com . All amendments to the official zoning map shall
be listed in the order adopted in a separate register maintained in and kept
current by the Code Enforcement Office.



   (B)   The official zoning map carries the zoning district
designations established in this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.3)



§ 153.0184  ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.



   When definite distances in feet are not shown on the zoning map, the
following rules apply.



   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
right-of-way or centerlines of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed
to follow such right-of-way or centerlines.



   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot
lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.



   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits
shall be construed as following city limits.



   (D)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be
construed to be midway between the main tracks.



   (E)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall
be construed to follow such centerlines.



   (F)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way not subject to
zoning regulations is vacated by official action of the city, or whenever
such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line
adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all areas so
involved shall then be subject to all regulations of the extended districts.



   (G)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground
vary from those shown on the official zoning maps, or in other circumstances
where the zoning boundary is unclear, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
interpret the district boundaries with appeal to the Board of Adjustment.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.4)



§ 153.0185  NEWLY ANNEXED TERRITORY.



   From the date of annexation until the property is zoned to a permanent
zoning classification, annexed property will be zoned as an interim “RE”
(Residential Estate) District, except as otherwise provided in this section.



   (A)   Master planned developments. For any master planned
development approved as a “PD” (Planned Development) or an “MX”
(Mixed Use) District, the city may incorporate the terms of the approved
master site plan into a zoning ordinance following annexation of a property.



   (B)   Development agreements. Property that is subject to a
development agreement may be designated in accordance with any zoning
district classification set forth in the development agreement, and shall be
regulated by the development agreement. The zoning classifications shall be
applied upon the revision of the official zoning map. (See §§ 153.0680
through 153.0689 of this chapter.)



   (C)   Specific plan. The city may prepare a specific plan pursuant
to §§ 153.0640 through 153.0646 of this chapter. The owner(s) of property
may apply for rezoning to a classification consistent with the specific plan
in lieu of a temporary zoning classification.

DIVISION 4: BASE ZONING DISTRICTS



GENERALLY



§ 153.0200  IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.



   (A)   This division implements the land-use policies of the
Comprehensive Plan.



   (B)   Each section describes the relationship between the various
zoning district and the Comprehensive Plan and prescribes the design
regulations for the district.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.10)



§ 153.0201  GENERALLY.



   No development approval shall be issued unless the proposed development
conforms to the design regulations prescribed within the applicable zoning
district. Rules for interpreting the design regulations are included in the
lot layout, height and density/intensity standards. (See §§ 153.0985
through 153.0992 of this chapter.)



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.10)



§ 153.0202  USE REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Generally. No use is permitted unless it is listed as a
permitted or conditional use in this section. Those uses permitted as
principal uses or buildings within each zoning district are those uses listed
in the use matrix (Table 153.0202(A)). (Permitted accessory uses are set
forth in the accessory use regulations in Division 5 of this chapter.)

   (B)   Uses not mentioned. A use not specifically mentioned or
described by category in the use matrix (Table 153.0202(A) above) is
prohibited. Evaluation of these uses shall be as set forth in subsection
(D)(1) below.



   (C)   Uses preempted by state statute. Notwithstanding any provision
of this section to the contrary, uses that are required to be permitted in
any zoning district by state statute may be permitted in accordance with
state law whether or not the use is included in the use matrix (Table
153.0202(A) above).



   (D)   Interpretation.



      (1)   Materially similar uses.



         (a)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall determine if a
use not mentioned can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category
where similar uses are described. Interpretations may be ratified by the city
upon recommendation by the Planning Commission at a regularly scheduled
meeting. It is the intent of this chapter to group similar or compatible land
uses into specific zoning districts, either as permitted uses or as uses
authorized by a CUP. Uses not listed as a permitted use or CUP are presumed
to be prohibited from the applicable zoning district. In the event that a
particular use is not listed in the use matrix ( Table 153.0202(A) ), and
such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by
law, the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine whether a materially
similar use exists in this section.



         (b)   Should the Code Enforcement Officer determine that
a materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall
apply to the particular use not listed and the Code Enforcement Officer’s
decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the Code Enforcement Officer
determine that a materially similar use does not exist, the matter may be
referred to the Planning Commission for consideration for amendment to the
UDC to establish a specific listing for the use in question. Unless an appeal
is timely filed pursuant to §§ 153.0920 through 153.0924 of this chapter,
the Code Enforcement Officer’s decision is valid. If, when seeking periodic
ratification of interpretations, the Code Enforcement Officer’s
interpretation is reversed, then decisions made in reliance on the Code
Enforcement Officer’s interpretation are in violation of the UDC.



      (2)   Rules of construction. The Code Enforcement Officer may
determine that a use is materially similar if:



         (a)   The use is listed as within the same structure or
function classification as the use specifically enumerated in the use matrix
( Table 153.0202(A) above), as determined by the Land-Based Classification
Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA). The Code
Enforcement Officer shall refer to the following documents in making this
determination, which documents are incorporated by reference and are
maintained on file in the office of the Planning Department:



            1.   LBCS Structure Dimension with Detail
Descriptions (9-13-1999);



            2.   LBCS Function Dimension with Detail
Descriptions (9-13-1999); and



            3.   LBCS Tables (9-13-1999). The use shall be
considered materially similar if it falls within the same LBCS classification.



         (b)   If the use cannot be located within one of the
APA’s LBCS classifications pursuant to subsection (D)(2)(a) above, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall refer to the 1997 NAICS Manual. The use shall be
considered materially similar if it falls within the same industry
classification of the 1997 NAICS Manual (Table 153.0202(B) below).



      (3)   In order to assist in interpretation of the use matrix (
Table 153.0202(A) above), the LBCS and North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) numbers follow each use in the use matrix. In interpreting the
use matrix, the following rules of construction apply.



         (a)   If a use is listed for a specific classification,
while a more general classification within the same industry classification
is also listed for another use, the specific classification governs. The
specific use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the
general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar LBCS
or NAICS code number. The numbers increase as the classifications get more
specific.



 

Table 153.0202(B): Permitted Use Terminology


The letter ...
 
Has the following meaning ...


P
 
Permitted uses: The letter “P” indicates that the listed use is permitted
by right within the zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable standards of this chapter.


C
 
Conditional uses: The letter “C” indicates that the listed use is
permitted within the respective zoning district only after review and
approval of a conditional use permit, in accordance with the review
procedures of §§ 153.0700 through 153.0709 of this chapter.


A
 
Accessory uses: The letter “A” indicates that the listed use is permitted
only where it is accessory to another use that is permitted in the district
on the same lot.


-
 
Prohibited uses: A dash indicates that the use is not permitted in the
district.



 



         (b)   Some uses are listed separately but fall within
the same LBCS or NAICS classification. The uses within one such
classification are not permitted in all of the zoning districts as the others
simply because they fall within the same LBCS or NAICS classification. For
example, NAICS 5413 (“Architectural Engineering, and Related Services”)
is coded under “Office, General”. Assume that the use matrix ( Table
153.0202(A) above) sets out a classification for “Laboratories, Testing,”
which is NAICS 54138 (“Testing Laboratories”, a subheading of 54183). The
latter five-digit number (i.e., 54183) is more specific than the four-digit
code (i.e., 5413). Accordingly, “Testing Laboratories” is not included
within the same classification as “General Offices”. However, if
“Testing Laboratories” had not been separately listed, it would be
permitted in all districts where “General Offices” is permitted.

“RP” RESOURCE PROTECTION



§ 153.0215  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “RP” (Resource Protection) Districts provide areas for
agricultural operations and natural resource industries. These districts are
composed mainly of unsubdivided lands that are vacant or are in agricultural
uses with some dwellings and some accessory uses. “RP” zoning:



      (1)   Protects and preserves valuable agricultural areas;



      (2)   Implements agricultural and natural resource protection;



      (3)   Establishes performance standards for rural businesses;



      (4)   Preserves rural areas;



      (5)   Preserves pasture land and agriculture; and



      (6)   Identifies areas appropriate for agricultural
preservation.



   (B)   The “RP” (Resource Protection) District may be used to
establish a buffer of low-intensity uses along streams, floodplains, and
similar environmentally sensitive areas. The “RP” District is suitable
for areas with large tracts of open space, agricultural areas, woodlands or
fields. The “RP” District is not suitable for areas with central water
and sewer, or where collector or higher-order streets are spaced closer than
one mile apart.

“RE” (RESIDENTIAL ESTATE)



§ 153.0230  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   “RE” (Residential Estate) Districts are the designation for a
low-density residential use on a lot that is a minimum of one acre. “RE”
Districts implement the following policies by:



   (A)   Ensuring that proposed land uses and development are
compatible in their use, character and size to the site and the surrounding
areas;



   (B)   Based on a comprehensive land-use plan, encouraging more
intensive development in and near neighborhood centers with less intensive
development between neighborhood centers and implementing these changes
through zoning; and



   (C)   Encouraging patterns of urban development that provide a full
range of housing choices and promoting a sense of community, urban vitality
and the efficient provision of infrastructure.

§ 153.0245  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “NS” (Neighborhood Suburban) Districts provide areas for
low-density, single-family uses that provide a buffer between the
agricultural and “RE” (Residential Estate) classifications and higher
density.



   (B)   Minimum lot size requirements are provided in order to allow
for market and design flexibility while preserving neighborhood character.



   (C)   “NS” Districts encourage more intensive development in and
near neighborhood centers with less intensive development between
neighborhood centers. They provide a full range of housing choices and
promote a sense of community, urban vitality and the efficient provision of
infrastructure.

“NU” (NEIGHBORHOOD URBAN)



§ 153.0260  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “NU” (Neighborhood Urban) Districts provide areas for
medium to high-density, single-family residential uses mixed with a variety
of housing types where adequate public facilities and services exist with
capacity to serve development. These districts are composed mainly of areas
containing a mixture of single-family, two-family and multi-family dwellings,
and open space where similar residential development seems likely to occur.



   (B)   (1)   The district regulations are designed to encourage a
suitable neighborhood environment for family life by including among the
permitted uses such facilities as schools and churches, and to preserve the
openness of the area by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards.



      (2)   Mixed residential districts provide flexible minimum lot
size and density requirements in order to allow for market and design
flexibility while preserving the neighborhood character and permitting
applicants to cluster development in order to preserve environmentally
sensitive and agricultural land areas.



      (3)   These districts encourage more intensive development in
and near neighborhood centers with less intensive development between
neighborhood centers. They provide a full range of housing choices and
promote a sense of community, urban vitality and the efficient provision of
infrastructure.

“O” (OFFICE)



§ 153.0275  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “O” (Office) Districts permit institutional, indoor
retail, service and office uses requiring arterial or collector street access
and business and commercial development along urban arterials. The purpose of
“O” Districts is to accommodate well-designed development sites that
provide excellent transportation access, make the most efficient use of
existing infrastructure and provide for orderly transitions and buffers
between uses. “O” (Office) Districts facilitate the development and
expansion of targeted industries, including manufacturing and assembly,
research, high technology, aviation and regional distribution, and business
incubator facilities. These districts encourage economic development
activities that will:



      (1)   Strengthen neighborhoods and communities;



      (2)   Provide educational, training and employment
opportunities;



      (3)   Provide necessary support services; and



      (4)   Promote and encourage economic participation for all
citizens.



   (B)   They restrict uses primarily to offices and ancillary uses
that do not have peak weeknight or weekend usage in order to provide a buffer
between residential areas and more intensive uses.

“CN” (COMMERCIAL NEIGHBORHOOD)



§ 153.0295  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “CN” (Commercial Neighborhood) Districts provide small
areas for offices, professional services, service and shopfront retail uses -
all designed in scale with surrounding residential uses. The district
regulations are designed to protect and encourage the transitional character
of the districts by permitting a limited group of uses of a commercial
nature, and to protect the abutting and surrounding residential areas by
requiring certain minimum yard and area standards, which are comparable to
those called for in the residential districts. These districts are also
intended to reduce auto trips by permitting a limited group of commercial
uses to be located in close proximity to residential areas.



   (B)   These districts provide a balance of residential and
non-residential land-use opportunities, reflecting the economic needs of
residents and business owners. “CN” (Commercial Neighborhood) Districts
implement the following policies by:



      (1)   Based on a comprehensive land-use plan, encouraging more
intensive development in and near neighborhood centers with less intensive
development between neighborhood centers and implementing these changes
through zoning; and



      (2)   Encouraging resident and employment growth within
walking distance of the downtown area and neighborhood centers in order to
support an inter-modal transportation system.



   (C)   “CN” (Commercial Neighborhood) Districts are limited to:



      (1)   The intersection of arterial/collector,
collector/collector and collector/local street intersections, except where an
existing commercial area has been established prior to the adoption of this
chapter; or



      (2)   The interior of a block along an arterial or collector
street that lies parallel to an existing commercial area.

§ 153.0330  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   “CL” (Commercial Large-Scale) Districts permit general
commercial activities designed to serve the community, such as repair shops,
wholesale businesses, warehousing and limited retail sales with some outdoor
display of goods. These districts promote a broad range of commercial
operations and services necessary for large regions, providing community
balance. The “CL” Districts ensure that proposed land uses and
development are compatible in their use, character and size to the site and
the surrounding areas. They support diversification of the economic base and
neighborhood services, including schools, libraries, stores, transit centers
and community service facilities in accessible, pedestrian-friendly
environments.



   (B)   “CL” (Commercial Large-Scale) Districts provide for more
intensive commercial uses than those located within the “CN” (Commercial
Neighborhood) or “CG” (Commercial General) Zoning Districts. “CL”
District uses are typically characterized as community and regional shopping
centers, power centers and/or assembly of similar uses into a single complex
under either single ownership or the structure of a property owner or
condominium-styled organization. Development in “CL” Districts
incorporates shared internal circulation and limited curb cuts to arterial
streets.

§ 153.0390  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   “PD” (Planned Development) Districts are established to:



   (A)   Provide flexibility in the planning and construction of
development projects by allowing a combination of uses developed in
accordance with an approved plan that protects adjacent properties;



   (B)   Provide an environment within the layout of a site that
contributes to a sense of community and a coherent living style;



   (C)   Encourage the preservation and enhancement of natural
amenities and cultural resources; to protect the natural features of a site
that relate to its topography, shape and size; and to provide for a minimum
amount of open space;



   (D)   Provide for a more efficient arrangement of land uses,
buildings, circulation systems and infrastructure; and



   (E)   Encourage infill projects and the development of sites made
difficult for conventionally designed development because of shape, size,
abutting development, poor accessibility or topography.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24)



§ 153.0391  EVALUATION CRITERIA.



   (A)   (1)   In order to foster the attractiveness of a “PD”
(Planned Development) District and its surrounding neighborhoods, preserve
property values, provide an efficient road and utility network, ensure the
movement of traffic, implement comprehensive planning and better serve the
public health, safety and general welfare, the following criteria apply to
master site plans.



      (2)   These criteria shall neither be regarded as inflexible
requirements, nor are they intended to discourage creativity or innovation.



   (B)   Insofar as practicable, the landscape shall be preserved in
its natural state by minimizing tree and soil removal.



   (C)   Proposed buildings shall be sited harmoniously to the terrain
and to other buildings in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the
proposed buildings.



   (D)   With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation and
parking, special attention shall be given to the location and number of
access points to public streets, width of interior drives and access points,
general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic
and the arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and,
insofar as practicable, do not detract from the design of proposed structures
and neighboring properties.



   (E)   Private streets and gates may be approved as part of the
application, but are not required. They shall conform to Division 11 of this
chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.1)



§ 153.0392  MINIMUM SIZE.



   There is no minimum size for a “PD” (Planned Development) District.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.2)



§ 153.0393  PERMITTED USES AND DENSITY.



   (A)   Uses. A “PD” (Planned Development) District may include
residential, commercial and industrial uses; cluster housing; common areas;
unusual arrangements of structures on site; or other combinations of
structures and uses that depart from standard development. The uses permitted
in a “PD” District are those designated in the approved master site plan.
Density limits are used to determine the maximum number of permitted dwelling
units.



   (B)   Density table. The master site plan shall divide the “PD”
(Planned Development) District into land-use categories and shall indicate
the uses permitted in each category.



   (C)   Attached dwelling units. Dwelling units may be attached in all
“PD” (Planned Development) districts, except for land-use categories
designated “RE” (Residential Estate) and “NS” (Neighborhood Suburban)
Districts.



   (D)   Lots. There is no minimum area requirement for lots, and lots
do not need to front onto a street. Lot boundaries may coincide with
structure boundaries, except where perimeter lot setbacks are required.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.3)



§ 153.0394  HEIGHT AND YARD REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Height limitation. The maximum height of structures shall be
as prescribed for each land-use category or category of uses.



   (B)   Required setbacks.



      (1)   Setbacks shall be governed by the “PD” (Planned
Development) District plan. Lots located on the perimeter of a “PD”
District shall adhere to the minimum and maximum setback requirements of the
base zoning district unless a lesser setback is approved in the master site
plan. There are no setbacks for interior lots; provided that, the
requirements of the Uniform Building Code are met.



      (2)   If access to a garage or carport is provided from the
front or side of a lot, then the garage/carport shall maintain a 20-foot
setback from the back of the sidewalk, or curb if there is no sidewalk, as
measured along the centerline of the driveway.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.4)



§ 153.0395  INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Streets and sidewalks. Streets within a “PD” (Planned
Development) District may be public or private. However, the Planning
Commission may require dedication and construction of public streets through
or into a “PD” District. Public or private streets shall conform to the
transportation standards. (See §§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of this
chapter.)



   (B)   Utilities. All utility systems shall comply with the utilities
standards. (See §§ 153.1090 through 153.1095 of this chapter.) Water and
sanitary sewer systems within a “PD” (Planned Development) District may
be publicly or privately owned; however, the maintenance of private systems
shall be the responsibility of the proposed development’s community
association. Public utility systems shall be approved by the applicable
agency or the city.



   (C)   Easements. Utilities shall be placed in public streets or
easements that are a minimum of 16 feet in width unless a narrower width is
approved by the applicable utility. Dead-end easements shall not be permitted
unless a city-approved vehicular turnaround is provided at the end of each
such easement.



   (D)   Garbage collection. Private streets in a “PD” (Planned
Development) District shall be arranged so that garbage may be collected
without creating a safety hazard. All garbage collection shall be subject to
the then current garbage collection ordinance of the city.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.5)



§ 153.0396  PARKS/OPEN SPACE.



   Each master site plan shall provide for a minimum amount of parks/open
space as required by §§ 153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter.



   (A)   Parks/open space percentages. The minimum open space
percentage requirements are as indicated in Table 153.0396(A) below. They are
calculated by dividing the total open space within a “PD” (Planned
Development) District by the gross site area. The land-use category shall be
determined by the base zoning district. For “PD” Districts that include
both residential and non-residential uses, the required open space shall be
calculated by multiplying the open space percentage by the area of each use
and adding the products thus obtained.

   (B)   Reduction in parks/open space. At its discretion, the Planning
Commission may approve a decrease in the amount of required parks/open space
when the master site plan includes unique design features or amenities that
achieve an especially attractive and desirable development such as, but not
limited to, terraces, sculptures, water features, preservation and
enhancement of unusual natural features or landscape sculpture (i.e., areas
that are intensely landscaped).

   Off-street parking and truck loading facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the parking standards (§§ 153.1295 through 153.1301 of this
chapter). Parking shall be prohibited on any private street less than 28 feet
in width; if utilized on streets 28 feet or wider, the parking must be
clearly distinguishable from the movement lanes.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.7)



§ 153.0398  COMMON AREAS AND FACILITIES.



   (A)   Adequate provision shall be made for a community association
or other legal entity with direct responsibility to, and control by, the
property owners involved to provide for the operation and maintenance of all
common areas and facilities, including private streets and sidewalks, which
are a part of the “PD” (Planned Development) District.



   (B)   The applicant shall submit a legal instrument establishing a
plan for the use and permanent maintenance of the common areas/facilities and
demonstrating that the community association is self-perpetuating and
adequately funded to accomplish its purposes, and providing the city with
written permission for access at any time without liability when on official
business, and further, to permit the city to remove obstructions if necessary
for emergency vehicle access and assess the cost of removal to the owner of
the obstruction. The instrument must be approved by the city as to legal form
prior to any plat recordation and shall be recorded at the same time as the
plat.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.24.8)



§ 153.0399  MASTER SITE PLAN.



   After the “PD” (Planned Development) District Zoning is granted, a
master site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning
Commission prior to approval of any plats or the issuance of any development
approvals or certificates of occupancy. The master site plan shall
incorporate any conditions imposed with the granting of the “PD” District
zoning.

“MX” (MIXED USE)



§ 153.0410  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   “MX” (Mixed Use) Districts allow the emergence of complete
neighborhoods with a complete mix of residential, retail, service and office
activities. These districts de-emphasize land-use regulations, and instead
permit any use to be established subject to design standards established in
the use patterns (Division 2 of this chapter). Urban design standards are
required in order to maintain a neighborhood commercial scale, to promote
pedestrian activity and to maintain the unique character of the center.
Pedestrian circulation and common parking areas are required.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.25)

DIVISION 5: OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS



GENERALLY



§ 153.0425  DESIGNATION AND ISSUES.



   (A)   The overlay zoning districts address special siting, use, and
compatibility issues that require use and development regulations in addition
to those found in the underlying zoning districts. If any regulation in an
overlay zoning district requires lower densities, greater setbacks or
otherwise imposes greater standards than those required by the base zoning
district, the more restrictive standard applies.



   (B)   The zoning designation of property located within an overlay
zoning district shall consist of the regular zone acronym and the overlay
zoning district symbol as a suffix. For example, if a parcel is zoned
“NS” (Neighborhood Suburban) and is also located within an “NP”
(Neighborhood Preservation) Overlay Zoning District, the zoning designation
of the property is “NS(NP)”. In effect, the designation of property as
being within the “NP” District places such property in a new zoning
district classification and all procedures and requirements for zoning and
rezoning must be followed.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.40)



“NP” (NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION)



§ 153.0440  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The city has many unique and distinctive residential
neighborhoods or commercial districts that contribute significantly to the
overall character and identity of the community. They are worthy of
preservation and protection, but may lack sufficient historical,
architectural or cultural significance at the present time to be designated
as historic districts. As a matter of public policy, the city aims to
preserve, protect, enhance and perpetuate the value of these residential
neighborhoods or commercial districts through the establishment of “NP”
(Neighborhood Preservation) Districts.



   (B)   The purposes of an “NP” (Neighborhood Preservation)
District in residential neighborhoods or commercial districts are to:



      (1)   Protect and strengthen desirable and unique physical
features, design characteristics and recognized identity and charm;



      (2)   Promote and provide for economic revitalization;



      (3)   Protect and enhance the livability of the community;



      (4)   Reduce conflict and prevent blighting caused by
incompatible and insensitive development and promote new compatible
development;



      (5)   Stabilize property values;



      (6)   Provide residents and property owners with a planning
tool for future development;



      (7)   Promote and retain affordable housing;



      (8)   Encourage and strengthen civic pride; and



      (9)   Ensure the harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and
redevelopment of the city.



   (C)   The “NP” (Neighborhood Preservation) District planning
tool implements:



      (1)   The creation and adoption of urban design guidelines and
standards that will enhance the quality of life and encourage the
preservation and enhancement of the community’s important historic and
cultural characteristics, including architectural styles and historic
districts as well as existing residential and commercial districts and
neighborhood centers; and



      (2)   Neighborhood involvement in developing
neighborhood-specific plans that define the character and pattern of
development for their neighborhood and that establish infill development
guidelines.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.40)



§ 153.0441  DESIGNATION CRITERIA.



   To be designated as an “NP” (Neighborhood Preservation) District,
the area must meet the following criteria.



   (A)   It must contain a minimum of one blockface (all the lots on
one side of a block).



   (B)   At least 75% of the land area in the proposed district was
improved at least 25 years ago, and is presently improved.



   (C)   It must possess one or more of the following distinctive
features that create a cohesive, identifiable setting, character or
association:



      (1)   Scale, size, type of construction or distinctive
building materials;



      (2)   Spatial relationships between buildings;



      (3)   Lot layouts, setbacks, street layouts, alleys or
sidewalks;



      (4)   Special natural or streetscape characteristics, such as
creek beds, parks, greenbelts, gardens or street landscaping and use
patterns, including mixed or unique uses or activities; or



      (5)   Abutments or links to designated historic landmarks
and/or districts.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.40.1)



§ 153.0442  ZONING AUTHORITY.



   Separate ordinances are required to designate each “NP”
(Neighborhood Preservation) District. Ordinances designating each district
shall identify the designated boundaries, applicable designation criteria and
design standards for that district and shall be consistent with any existing
neighborhood and/or community plans.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.40.2)



§ 153.0443  NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION DISTRICT.



   “NP” (Neighborhood Preservation) Districts are overlay zoning
districts. Property designated within these districts must also be designated
as being within one or more of the base zoning classifications. Authorized
uses must be permitted in both the regular zoning district and the overlay
zoning district. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of a
specific “NP” District ordinance and the base zoning district
regulations, the provisions of the “NP” District ordinance apply.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.40.3)



§ 153.0444  DESIGNATION PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Initiation. A zoning change application for designation as an

“AO” (AIRPORT OVERLAY)



§ 153.0460  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The intent of this section is to regulate and restrict the
height of structures and objects of natural growth and otherwise regulate the
use of property in the vicinity of the city’s airport by creating certain
airport zones within the zoned districts, and to define their boundaries by
adopting and referring to the city’s airport zoning map.



   (B)   This section implements the following plan policies.



      (1)   Land use adjacent to the airport should be reserved for
commercial and industrial development related to air transportation or those
businesses needing easy access to airport facilities.



      (2)   Airport-related uses will be encouraged in the areas
near the airport.



      (3)   Residential land uses will be discouraged in the areas
where noise exceeds recommended land-use standards.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.41)



§ 153.0461  AIRPORT ZONES ESTABLISHED AND DEFINED.



   (A)   There is created within the city certain zones that include
all of the land lying within instrument approach zones, non-instrument
approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones, as
defined in this section. Such area and zones are shown on a map entitled
“Zoning Overlay Map”, consisting of one sheet, attached as part of the
“Airport Master Plan”(3-15-2007; 12- -2014). This map is adopted and made
a part of this section by reference. This map shall be filed and kept as a
part of the official zoning map of the city.



   (B)   Airport zones, as shown on the city’s “Airport Zoning
Map”, are established and defined in Table 153.0462(A) of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.41.1)



§ 153.0462  HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure or
tree shall be erected, altered or allowed to grow or be maintained in any
zone created by this division to a height in excess of the height limit
established for that zone.



   (B)   Such height limitations are established for each of the zones
in Table 153.0462(A) below.



   (C)   Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation,
the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.



 

Table 153.0462(A): Airport Overlay Zones and Height Restrictions


Zone
 
Definition
 
Height


Conical zone
 
A conical zone shall be the area that commences at the periphery of the
horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of 5,000 feet. The
conical zone does not include the instrument approach zones and transition
zones.
 
1 foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the
periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a height of 400 feet above the
airport elevation.


Horizontal zone
 
A horizontal zone shall be the area within a circle with its center at the
airport reference point and having a radius of 7,000 feet. The horizontal
zone does not include the instrument and non-instrument approach zones and
the transition zones.
 
150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 1,175 feet above mean sea
level.


Instrument approach zone
 
An instrument approach zone at each end of the instrument runways for
instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach zones shall have a
width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway,
widening uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet
beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the
centerline of the runway.
 
1 foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a
point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the
instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of
the runway; thence, 1 foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance
to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway.


Non-instrument
 
A non-instrument approach zone at each end of all approach zone
non-instrument runways for non- instrument landings and take-offs. The
non-instrument approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet at a distance of
200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening uniformly to a width of
2,500 feet at a distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its
centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
 
1 foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a
point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the
non-instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of
the runway.


Transition zones
 
Transition zones are adjacent to each instrument and non-instrument runway
and approach zone, as indicated on the Airport Zoning Map. Transition zones
symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown
on the Airport Zoning Map. Transition zones extend outward from a line 250
feet on either side of the centerline of the non-instrument runway, for the
length of such runway, plus 200 feet on each end; and 500 feet on either side
of the centerline of the instrument runway, for the length of such runway,
plus 200 feet on each end, and are parallel and level at such runway
centerlines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward
1 foot vertically for each 7 feet horizontally to the point where they
intersect

the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones shall be
adjacent to both instrument and non-instrument approach zones for the entire
length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as
shown on the Airport Zoning Map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically
with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and
slope upward and outward at the rate of 1 foot vertically for each 7 feet
horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the
horizontal and conical zones. Furthermore, transition zones shall be adjacent
to the instrument approach zone where it projects through and beyond the
limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet, measured
horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right angles
to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
 
1 foot in height for each 7 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at any
point 250 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of
non-instrument runways, extending 200 feet beyond each end, and 500 feet
normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the instrument runway,
extending 200 feet beyond each end, extending to a height of 150 feet above
the airport elevation, which is 1,175 feet above mean sea level. In addition
to the foregoing, there shall be height limits of 1 foot vertical height for
each 7 feet

horizontal distance, measured from the edges of all approach zones for the
entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the
points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. Further,
where the instrument approach zone projects through and beyond the conical
zone, a height limit of 1 foot for each 7 feet of horizontal distance shall
be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zone and
extending a distance of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach
zone measured normal to the centerline of the runway extended.



 



§ 153.0463  USE RESTRICTIONS.



   No use may be made of land within any zone established by this
subdivision in such a manner as to:



   (A)   Create electrical interference with radio communication
between the airport and aircraft;



   (B)   Make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport
lights and other lights;



   (C)   Result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport;



   (D)   Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; or



   (E)   Otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of
aircraft.

§ 153.0464  REGULATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED.



   This section in its entirety shall be considered by the Zoning
Administrator when reviewing applications for zoning development approvals.
The applicant for a zoning development approval shall include and submit
adequate information and detail necessary to ensure that the limitations of
this subdivision shall not be exceeded. Such information shall include, at a
minimum, a completed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 7460-1, along
with the comments submitted on the completed Form 7460-1 by the FAA.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.41.4)



§ 153.0465  CONDITIONS ON VARIANCES.



   Except as provided in § 153.0466 of this chapter, any variance
authorized to this subdivision shall be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question, at his or her own expense, to
install, operate and maintain such markers and lights as may be deemed
necessary by the Board of Zoning Appeals, acting with the advice and
recommendation of the FAA or the airport manager.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.41.5)



§ 153.0466  APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS TO PREEXISTING STRUCTURES AND USES.



   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (B) below, the regulations
prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of 9-10-2013, or where applicable, as of the
effective date of any subsequent amendment to these regulations. Nothing
contained in this section shall require any change in the construction,
alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration
of which was begun prior to 9-10-2013, or where applicable, prior to the
effective date of any subsequent amendment, and is diligently prosecuted.



   (B)   (1)   The owner of any structure, tree, natural growth or
use that existed prior to 9-10-2013, or where applicable prior to the
effective date of any subsequent amendment to this section, and which is
inconsistent with or in violation of this section or an amendment, shall be
required, as a condition of the continued maintenance of such structure,
tree, or use, to permit the installation, operation and maintenance of such
markers and lights as deemed necessary by the FAA or the city’s airport
manager, in order to indicate the presence of such object or hazardous use to
operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport.



      (2)   Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and
maintained at the expense of the city and not of such owner.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.41.6)



§ 153.0467  EXEMPTION OF UTILITY STRUCTURES.



   Structures of public utilities shall be excluded from the requirements

DIVISION 6: FLEXIBLE ZONING



§ 153.0480  DENSITY BONUS.



   (A)   There are instances where it is in the best interests of the
private landowner and the city to exceed the minimum requirements of this
chapter. In such instances, the city’s interests in restricting density or
imposing certain regulatory requirements can be offset by increases in open
space, natural resources or the provision of affordable housing or certain
amenities. Further, the system provides incentives to landowners while
preserving the overall integrity of the Comprehensive Plan by providing
uniform rules of general application for density increases. This system
provides regulatory incentives while ensuring that regulatory modifications
are not made solely and exclusively for the private benefit of the landowner.



   (B)   This division implements the following provisions:



      (1)   Develop ordinance revisions and development proposals
that conserve energy and water, enhance the attractiveness of the area and
protect valuable natural and cultural resources;



      (2)   Create a land exchange mechanism to acquire land for
public purposes;



      (3)   Encourage a balance of new development and
redevelopment; and



      (4)   Promote the provision of sound and affordable housing to
all city residents.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.50)



§ 153.0481  APPLICABILITY.



   This subsection applies to density and intensity on the parcel subject
to an application for development approval. Density bonuses will be granted
as of right if the applicant complies with the criteria established in §
153.0482 of this chapter. Applicants requesting a density bonus for a
residential subdivision may also reduce lot sizes through approval of a
conservation subdivision. (See §§ 153.0040 through 153.0051 of this
chapter.)



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 3.50.1)

   (A)   An applicant may be granted a density bonus by establishing
any of the incentive items as described in Column (A) of Table 153.0482(A)
below consistent with the standards described in Columns (B) and (C) of Table
153.0482(A) below. The total permissible dwelling units shall be calculated
in accordance with Column (C) of Table 153.0482(C) below. In no event shall
the cumulative total permissible dwelling units for public parks or open
space in Table 153.0482(A) below exceed that which is described in Table
153.0482(A) below.



   (B)   In no event shall minimum lot sizes be less than that shown in

Bonus Calculation


Affordable housing: low income
 
At least 15% of all dwelling units must be restricted as low-income housing
through a deed restriction or an enforceable contract with a public housing
authority or community development corporation.
 
BD = TD x Y where: BD = total permitted dwelling units, with bonus density;
TD = base calculation of total permitted dwelling units; and Y = 1.10. The
factor “Y” shall increase by 0.05 for every additional 5% of units
restricted as low-income housing, up to the maximum set forth in this section.


Affordable housing: very low income
 
At least 5% of all dwelling units must be restricted as very low-income
housing through a deed restriction or an enforceable contract with a public
housing authority or community development corporation.
 
BD = TD x Y where: BD = total permitted dwelling units, with bonus density;
TD = maximum number of dwelling units permitted by applying the maximum
density of the base zoning district (see § 3.12 Dimensional Regulations of
this chapter); and Y = 1.20. The factor “Y” shall increase by 0.05 for
every additional 15% of units restricted as very low-income housing, up to
the maximum set forth in this section.


Parks and open space
 
Establishment of active or passive open space in excess of the minimum
acreage requirements of the parks and open space standards (§§ 153.1015
through 153.1023 of this chapter). The area dedicated to open space shall
comprise at least 1 acre and shall comply with parks and open space standards
to receive bonus credit.
 
• For conventional subdivisions:

BD = [(NA  MLS) + (AOS x 4))

< [(NA  MLS) x C) where:

 

BD = total permissible dwelling units with bonus; NA = net acreage (adjusted
for right-of-way but not open space); MLS = minimum lot size; AOS =
additional open space (in acres) multiplied by maximum permitted density; and
C = cap on density from Table 153.0482(B) below.

 

• For conservation subdivisions:

BD = [(GA x MD) + (AOS x 4))< [(GA x MD) x C) where:

 

BD = total permissible dwelling units with bonus; GA = gross acres; MD =
maximum density of base district; AOS = additional open space (in acres)
multiplied by maximum permitted density; and C = cap on density from Table
153.0482(B) below.


Redevelopment
 
Redevelopment of existing strip centers in accordance with the provisions of
the commercial retrofit standards (§§ 153.0105 through 153.0116 of this
chapter).
 
For each 100 spaces of surface parking converted to structured parking on an
area not exceeding 20% of the site area, an additional 20,000 feet of
non-residential space may be constructed.


Retail site design
 
Superstores, shopping centers, or other retail uses located in zoning
districts “CG” (Commercial General) or “CL” (Commercial Large-Scale)
may obtain a density bonus pursuant to Column (C) where the proposed
development complies with the neighborhood center design criteria (§§
153.0065 through 153.0073 of this chapter).
 
A 30% increase in permitted height (permitted height x 1.3) may be granted.

DIVISION 7: PROCEDURES



GENERALLY



§ 153.0495  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The purpose of this division is to consolidate the procedures
for filing and processing applications for development approval. The format
is designed to allow users to quickly and efficiently ascertain the various
steps involved in obtaining development approval - from the initiation and
filing of an application, the administrative completeness review, the review
for compliance with substantive standards, through the public hearings:



      (1)   Sections 153.0495 through 153.0497, Generally; 153.0510
through 153.0519, Completeness Review; 153.0530 through 153.0533, Notice
Provisions; and 153.0545 through 153.0548, Public Hearing;



      (2)   Sections 153.0560 and 153.0561, Quasi-Judicial and
Legislative Approvals;



      (3)   Sections 153.0625 through 153.0628, Ministerial
Development Approvals;



      (4)   Division 8, Zoning Procedures;



      (5)   Division 9, Subdivisions;



      (6)   Division 10, Variances and Appeals and Miscellaneous
Development Orders; and



      (7)   Section 153.9999, Penalty.



   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are designed to implement the
Comprehensive Plan elements (i.e., land use, administrative circulating,
natural resources, housing, implementation, economic development,
agricultural, environmental and all subarea (specific neighborhood) and
functional (transportation, redevelopment, utility and downtown plans).



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.0)



§ 153.0496  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   No development or development activity is permitted
unless all development approvals applicable to the proposed development are
issued in accordance with this chapter. Development approvals are required
for all development, unless otherwise excepted, to ensure compliance with the
various adopted codes, standards and laws, and to ensure consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan and policies of the city. This division describes
procedural elements common to all applications. The specific procedures
followed in reviewing various applications for development approval differ.
Reference shall be made to the appropriate section in this chapter, which
addresses the procedures and requirements of a particular application.



      (2)   Generally, the procedures for all applications have five
common elements:



         (a)   Submittal of a complete application, including
required fee payments and appropriate information and studies;



         (b)   Review of the submittal by appropriate staff,
agencies and boards;



         (c)   A decision to approve, approve with conditions or
deny together with the description of the actions authorized and the time
period for exercising rights;



         (d)   If necessary, amending or appealing the decision;
and



         (e)   Recording the decision. Figure 153.0496(A) below
is a flow chart illustrating the general review process.







Figure 153.0496(A): Development Approval Application Flow Chart



Flow charts in permitting manuals or brochures aid applicants in
understanding the process.



   (B)   Appeals. This division describes procedural elements common to
all applications. Sections 153.0625 through 153.0628 and 153.9999 of this
chapter describe the procedures for processing certain types of applications.
Each division or section relating to procedure provides the following
information:



      (1)   Initiation. This describes how the application for the
development approval is filed;



      (2)   Pre-application procedures. This describes the procedure
for discussions with appropriate staff as to requirements for application
submittal and compliance with the Unified Development Code (UDC);



      (3)   Completeness review. This describes the process for
determining whether sufficient information has been submitted in order to
process an application, which includes the required fee payment and
appropriate information. A determination that an application is complete or
incomplete does not constitute a determination as to whether the application
complies with the standards for approval of the application;



      (4)   Decision. This describes the procedures for review of
the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies and boards, and for reaching a
determination as to whether the application for development approval is
approved, denied or approved with conditions;



      (5)   Approval criteria. This lists the criteria for approval
of the particular application. These criteria supplement and do not displace
any other criteria required by this chapter for approval of the application;



      (6)   Subsequent applications. This provides time periods for
processing of renewal applications;



      (7)   Scope of approval. This indicates the rights that an
applicant obtains from approval or conditional approval of an application,
what actions the development approval authorizes and the time period for
exercising rights under the order or development approval; and



      (8)   Recording procedures. This describes how the decision on
the application is recorded or filed in the public records.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.1)



§ 153.0497  CATEGORIES OF DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS.



   There are three basic categories of development approvals pursuant to
this chapter, defined in subsections (A), (B) and (C) below.



   (A)   Legislative development approvals. Legislative development
approvals involve a change in land-use policy. A public hearing is required,
but the procedural requirements of a quasi-judicial hearing do not apply.
Legislative development approvals include any change in the comprehensive or
specific plan, any change to the text of the UDC, any rezoning and any
creation of a “PD” (Planned Development) District or floating zone.



   (B)   Quasi-judicial development approval. A quasi-judicial
development approval involves the application of a discretionary standard
required by this chapter to an application. It requires a public hearing.
Procedural due process requirements apply as established in §§ 153.0530
through 153.0533 of this chapter. Examples include master development
approvals, conditional use permits (CUPs), variances and administrative
appeals.



   (C)   Ministerial development approvals. Ministerial development
approvals involve the application of the standards of the UDC to an
application by an administrative official or agency. A public hearing is not
required. A ministerial development approval typically occurs late in the
development approval process. Examples include building permits and
certificates of occupancy.

COMPLETENESS REVIEW



§ 153.0510  GENERAL.



   This subdivision applies to any application, unless otherwise provided
in the regulations for the specific application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3)



§ 153.0511  PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.



   Before any application is filed with the Code Enforcement Officer, any
applicant for a legislative or quasi-judicial development approval may elect
to attend a pre-application meeting with the Code Enforcement Officer. The
purpose of the pre-application meeting is to discuss, in general, the
procedures and substantive requirements for the application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.1; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.0512  APPLICATION MATERIALS.



   No application is complete unless all of the information required by
§§ 153.1605 through 153.1611 of this chapter is included and all filing
fees have been paid. An application that includes such information is deemed
complete. Current application materials shall be made available in the
Planning Department. Such applications shall be filed in advance of any
public hearing neighborhood meeting or public meeting required pursuant to
the UDC or statute.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.2)



§ 153.0513  REVIEW PROCEDURES.



   These procedures shall be used to review any application for
completeness unless a different procedure is established elsewhere in this
chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.3)



§ 153.0514  JURISDICTION.



   Unless the provisions pertaining to a particular application prescribe
otherwise:



   (A)   All applications shall be reviewed by the Code Enforcement
Officer for completeness; and



   (B)   The final determination of the Code Enforcement Officer on
completeness of an application constitutes a final development order and is
appealable.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.4)



§ 153.0515  TIME LIMITS BY COMPLETE APPLICATION.



   Whenever this chapter establishes a time period for processing an
application, such time period does not commence until the Code Enforcement
Officer has reviewed such application for completeness in order to determine
whether the application has been properly submitted, and the applicant has
corrected all deficiencies in the application. Review for completeness of
application forms is solely for the purpose of determining whether
preliminary information required for submission with the application is
sufficient to allow further processing, and shall not constitute a decision
as to whether application complies with the provisions of the UDC.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.5; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.0516  REVIEW BY CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.



   (A)   Unless a different procedure is described in this chapter,
this subdivision applies to the review of an application for completeness.



   (B)   If an application is deemed incomplete by the Code Enforcement
Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify that applicant in writing
not later than 15 working days after the date of application. Unless the
application requires review by any other local or special district, or
regional, state, or federal agency or entity, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall within five working days transmit the application to such agency or
entity requesting written comments within 15 working days. In such case, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall have 30 days to render his or her decision. If
an application is deemed incomplete and the written determination is not made
within the 15- or 30-day period, whichever is applicable, after receipt of
the application, the application shall be deemed complete for purposes of
this chapter. Upon receipt of any resubmittal of the application, a new
five-day period shall begin, during which period the Code Enforcement Officer
shall determine the completeness of the application. If the application is
determined not to be complete, the Code Enforcement Officer’s determination
shall specify those parts of the application that are incomplete and shall
indicate the manner in which they can be made complete, including a list and
thorough description of the specific information needed to complete the
application. The applicant shall submit materials to the Code Enforcement
Officer in response to the list and description.



   (C)   If the application, together with the submitted materials, are
determined not to be complete, the Code Enforcement Officer shall specify in
writing the information required and the applicant may resubmit the
application with the information required by the Code Enforcement Officer or
may appeal that decision in writing to the appellate agency as follows:



      (1)   Legislative development applications: to the Planning
Commission; and



      (2)   Quasi-judicial development applications: to the Board of
Appeals.



   (D)   The appellate agency shall render a final written
determination on the appeal not later than the next available meeting after
receipt of the applicant’s written appeal. Notwithstanding a decision by
the Code Enforcement Officer that the application and submitted materials are
incomplete, if the final written determination on the appeal is not made
within 30 working days after the appellate agency’s initial meeting, the
applicant must send notice to the City Clerk/Finance Director requesting
action. The City Clerk/Finance Director shall notify the appropriate
respondent. If the final written determination on the appeal is not made
within 30 working days after the appellate agency’s receipt of notice from
the City Clerk/Finance Director, the application with the submitted materials
shall be deemed complete for the purposes of this chapter.



   (E)   Nothing in this section precludes an applicant and the Code
Enforcement Officer from mutually agreeing to an extension of any time limit
provided by this section.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.6; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.0517  TIME LIMITS.



   (A)   (1)   If the reviewing agency fails to act within the time
period required for completeness review, the applicant must send notice to
the City Clerk/Finance Director requesting action.



      (2)   The City Clerk/Finance Director shall notify the
appropriate respondent.



   (B)   If the reviewing agency fails to act within the time period
required for completeness review after the reviewing agency’s receipt of
notice from the City Clerk/Finance Director, the application is deemed
complete.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.7)



§ 153.0518  LIMITATION ON FURTHER INFORMATION REQUESTS.



   After the Code Enforcement Officer or the appellate agency accepts a
development application as complete, the Code Enforcement Officer or the
reviewing agency may, in the course of processing the application, request
the applicant to clarify, amplify, correct or otherwise supplement the
information required for the application, if such would be required by the
agency to render a final determination on the merits.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.3.8)



§ 153.0519  TRAFFIC IMPACT REPORTS OR ANALYSES.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   The intent of this subdivision is to provide the
information necessary to allow decision-makers to assess the transportation
implications of site-generated traffic associated with a proposed
development. The goal is to address the transportation-related issues
associated with development proposals that may be of concern to neighboring
residents, business owners and property owners, and to provide a basis for
negotiation regarding improvements and funding participation in conjunction
with an application for development.



      (2)   The isolated and cumulative impact of the proposed
development needs to be understood in relation to the existing and proposed
capacity of the street system, and to ensure that traffic congestion will be
maintained at reasonable levels so as not to hinder the passage of public
safety vehicles, degrade the quality of life or contribute to hazardous
traffic conditions. This section establishes requirements for the analysis
and evaluation of transportation impacts associated with proposed
developments.



   (B)   Purpose and findings. The purpose of the traffic impact report
is to identify the impacts on capacity, level of service (LOS) and safety,
which are likely to be created by a proposed development. A traffic impact
report should identify the improvements needed to:



      (1)   Ensure safe ingress to and egress from a site;



      (2)   Maintain adequate street capacity on adjacent public
streets;



      (3)   Ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions
on streets and at intersections in the vicinity of a proposed development;



      (4)   Avoid creation of or mitigate existing hazardous traffic
conditions;



      (5)   Minimize the impact of non-residential traffic on
residential neighborhoods in the community; and



      (6)   Protect the substantial public investment in the
existing street system.



   (C)   Types of studies. Traffic impact studies may be required at
several stages in the development process. No application for development
will be accepted without an appropriate traffic impact report. The types of
traffic impact reports required under the chapter are as follows:



      (1)   A traffic impact report will be required for any
application for a development order for any change in the comprehensive or
specific plan, any change to the text of the UDC, any rezoning or any
creation of a proposed development or floating zone. The purpose of such
study will be to evaluate whether adequate transportation capacity exists or
will be available within a reasonable time period to safely and conveniently
accommodate proposed uses permitted under the requested land-use or zoning
classification.



      (2)   A traffic impact report will also be required for
certain permitted and conditional uses and major subdivisions exceeding
specific trip generation thresholds. The purpose of a traffic impact report
will be to:



         (a)   Evaluate traffic operations and impacts at site
access points under projected traffic loads;



         (b)   Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on
affected intersections in the vicinity of the development site;



         (c)   Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on
the quality of traffic flow on public streets located in the vicinity of the
site;



         (d)   Evaluate the impact of the proposed development on
residential streets in the vicinity of the site;



         (e)   Ensure that site access and other improvements
needed to mitigate the traffic impact of the development meet commonly
accepted engineering design standards and access management criteria; and



         (f)   Ensure that adequate facilities for pedestrians,
transit users and bicyclists have been provided.



      (3)   All land subdivisions that do not require a traffic
impact report will be required to complete a traffic design analysis. The
purpose of a traffic design analysis will be to:



         (a)   Ensure that the proposed street layout is
consistent with the public roadway design standards;



         (b)   Ensure the proper design and spacing of site
access points and identify where limitations on access should be established;



         (c)   Ensure that potential safety problems have been
properly evaluated and addressed;



         (d)   Ensure that internal circulation patterns will not
interfere with traffic flow on existing public streets; and



         (e)   Ensure that appropriate facilities for
pedestrians, transit users and bicyclists have been provided in plans for the
development.



   (D)   Applicability.



      (1)   A traffic impact report shall also be required for any
major subdivision, CUP or site plan under the following described conditions:



         (a)   A proposed rezoning that could generate 150 or
more directional trips during the peak hour or at least 1,000 more trips per
day than the most intensive use that could be developed under existing zoning;



         (b)   A project on a site located along, or which has
the potential to take access within 500 feet of, a corridor identified as a
freeway or expressway on the thoroughfare plan; or



         (c)   A proposed development for a three and
one-half-acre or larger site.



      (2)   Where a traffic impact report is required, the
acceptance of the application for the purposes of beginning the mandatory
60-day time limit applicable to action shall not commence until the traffic
impact report has been reviewed for completeness and has been accepted by the
Code Enforcement Officer as meeting the content requirements of the UDC. The
applicant shall be notified within ten days if the traffic impact report is
found to be inadequate.



      (3)   Traffic design analysis shall be required for any
subdivision or general development plan for which a traffic impact report is
not required. Traffic design analyses completed at an early stage of
development may need to be updated to include more detail as development
plans become more specific or approval actions result in the reformulation of
plans. As part of the review for determining whether a development
application is complete, proposals for which an earlier traffic design
analysis or traffic impact report has been completed will be reviewed to
ensure consistency with previous approvals or to identify the need for
revision or refinement of previously completed analyses or reports.



   (E)   Waiver. The requirements of this section for a traffic impact
report may be waived by the city’s Code Enforcement Officer upon a
determination that such report is not necessary to determine needed road
improvements or that no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be created by the
development as proposed. Developments in the Central Development Core
District that are not required to provide on-site, off-street parking are
exempt from the requirements of this section.



   (F)   Preparation. The applicant may choose to have a traffic impact
report prepared by a qualified professional with experience in the
preparation of such analysis, or may choose to have the Code Enforcement
Officer prepare a report once the development application is submitted. Where
the applicant chooses to have the Code Enforcement Officer prepare the
report, the time frame for the Code Enforcement Officer to render a decision
shall be extended by 45 days to permit time to prepare the report. The
applicant shall be responsible for the costs of preparation of the traffic
study incurred by the Code Enforcement Officer.



   (G)   Traffic service standards. The standards for traffic service
that shall be used to evaluate the findings of traffic impact reports or
analyses are as follows:



      (1)   Capacity. A volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio of 0.80 shall
not be consistently exceeded on any freeway or expressway as designated on
the thoroughfare plan, and a V/C ratio of 0.90 shall not be consistently
exceeded on any arterial or collector street as designated on the
thoroughfare plan. CONSISTENTLY means that the V/C ratios are exceeded based
on average daily peak-hour traffic counts, projections or estimates.



      (2)   Level of service. For corridors, including mainline,
merging areas and ramp junctions, an LOS C shall be maintained on any
expressway, freeway or arterial, and an LOS D on any other designated
non-local street on the thoroughfare plan. At all intersections, an LOS C
shall be maintained on any arterial or higher-order street and an LOS D on
any other non-residential street. Where the existing LOS is below these
standards, the traffic impact report shall identify those improvements or
transportation demand management techniques needed to maintain the existing
LOS, and what additional improvements would be needed to raise the LOS to the
standards indicated.



      (3)   Number of access points. The number of access points
provided shall be the minimum needed to provide adequate access capacity for
the site. Evidence of LOS D operations for individual public street movements
at access locations is a primary indication of the need for additional access
points. However, the spacing and geometric design of all access points shall
be consistent with the access management criteria of the UDC.



      (4)   Residential street impact. Average daily traffic on
residential streets shall be within the ranges spelled out in the
thoroughfare plan for the class of street involved. No non-residential
development shall increase the traffic on a residential street with at least
300 average daily trips by more than 25%, and shall contribute no more than
20% of the traffic on any street segment providing residential access.



      (5)   Traffic flow and progression. The location of new
traffic signals or proposed changes to cycle lengths or timing patterns of
existing signals to meet LOS standards shall not interfere with the goal of
achieving adequate traffic progression on major public streets in the
vicinity of the development.



      (6)   Vehicle storage. The capacity of storage bays and
auxiliary lanes for turning traffic shall be adequate to ensure that turning
traffic will not interfere with through traffic flows on any public street.



      (7)   Internal circulation. On-site vehicle circulation and
parking patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of
traffic on any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of
site traffic.



      (8)   Safety. Access points shall be designed to provide for
adequate sight distance and appropriate facilities to accommodate
acceleration and deceleration of site traffic. Where traffic from the
proposed development will impact any location with an incidence of high
accident frequency (defined as one of the five to ten highest accident
locations in the area), the accident history should be evaluated and a
determination made that the proposed site access or additional site traffic
will not further aggravate the situation. It is understood that the
correction of an existing off-site safety deficiency is not typically the
responsibility of the developer.



   (H)   Contents. A traffic impact report shall contain information
addressing the factors listed in subsections (H)(1) through (H)(9) below.



      (1)   Site description. The traffic impact report shall
contain illustrations and narratives that describe the characteristics of the
site and adjacent land uses as well as expected development in the vicinity
that will influence future traffic conditions. A description of potential
uses and traffic generation to be evaluated shall be provided. A description
of the proposed development, including access plans, staging plans and an
indication of land use and intensity, shall be provided.



      (2)   Study area. The traffic impact report shall identify the
geographic area under study and identify the roadway segments, critical
intersections and access points to be analyzed. The focus shall be on
intersections and access points adjacent to the site. Roadways or
intersections within one-half mile of the site, where at least 5% of the
existing peak-hour capacity will be composed of trips generated by the
proposed development, shall be included in the analysis.



      (3)   Existing traffic conditions. The traffic impact report
shall contain a summary of the data utilized in the study and an analysis of
existing traffic conditions, including:



         (a)   Traffic count and turning movement information,
including the source of and date when traffic count information was collected;



         (b)   Correction factors that were used to convert
collected traffic data into representative design-hour traffic volumes;



         (c)   Roadway characteristics, including the design
configuration of existing or proposed roadways, existing traffic control
measures (e.g., speed limits and traffic signals), and existing driveways and
turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site; and



         (d)   Identification of the existing LOS for roadways
and intersections without project development traffic using methods
documented in the Highway Capacity Manual 20001 or comparable accepted
methods of evaluation. LOS should be calculated for the weekday peak hour
and, in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic, the
Saturday peak hour.



      (4)   Horizon year(s) and background traffic growth. The
traffic impact report shall identify the horizon year(s) that were analyzed
in the study, the background traffic growth factors for each horizon year,
and the method and assumptions used to develop the background traffic growth.
Unless otherwise approved by the Code Enforcement Officer, the impact of
development shall be analyzed for the year after the development is completed
and ten years after the development is completed.



      (5)   Time periods to be analyzed. For each defined horizon
year, specific time periods are to be analyzed. For most land uses, this time
period will be the weekday peak hours. However, certain uses (e.g., major
retail centers, schools or recreational uses) will have characteristic peak
hours different than that found for adjacent streets, and these unique peak
hours may need to be analyzed to determine factors, such as proper site
access and turn lane storage requirements. The Code Enforcement Officer shall
be consulted for determination of the peak hours to be studied.



      (6)   Trip generation, reduction and distribution. The traffic
impact report shall summarize the projected peak hour and average daily trip
generation for the proposed development and illustrate the projected trip
distribution of trips to and from the site, and should identify the basis of
the trip generation, reduction and distribution factors used in the study.



      (7)   Traffic assignment. The traffic impact report shall
identify projected design-hour traffic volumes for roadway segments,
intersections or driveways in the study area, with and without the proposed
development, for the horizon year(s) of the study.



      (8)   Impact analysis. The traffic impact report shall address
the impact of traffic volumes of the projected horizon year(s) relative to
each of the applicable traffic service standards and shall identify the
methodology utilized to evaluate the impact. The weekday peak-hour impact
shall be evaluated as well as the Saturday peak hour for those uses
exhibiting high levels of weekend traffic generation.



      (9)   Mitigation/alternatives. In situations where the traffic
LOS standards are exceeded, the traffic impact report shall evaluate each of
the following alternatives for achieving the traffic service standards by:



         (a)   Identifying where additional rights-of-way are
needed to implement mitigation strategies;



         (b)   Identifying suggested phasing of improvements
where needed to maintain compliance with traffic service standards; and



         (c)   Identifying the anticipated cost of recommended
improvements.



   (I)   Process for the review and preparation of a traffic impact
report. This section provides an outline of the steps to be included in the
preparation and review of a traffic impact report.



      (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer and/or the City Manager
shall be consulted for assistance in determining whether a traffic impact
report needs to be prepared for a proposed development application.



      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer and/or the City Manager
shall meet with applicants to identify study issues, assumptions, horizon
years and time periods to be analyzed; analysis procedures; available sources
of data; past and related studies; report requirements; and other topics
relevant to study requirements.



      (3)   Following initial completion of a traffic impact report,
it shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer for distribution to the
staff of all roadway jurisdictions involved in the construction and
maintenance of public roadways serving the development.



      (4)   Within ten working days, staff shall complete an initial
review to determine the completeness of the study and shall provide a written
summary to the applicant outlining the need for any supplemental analysis to
adequately address the traffic service standards. A meeting to discuss the
contents and findings of the traffic impact report and the need for
additional analyses may be requested by the applicant.



      (5)   Following a determination that the technical analysis is
complete, staff shall prepare a report outlining recommendations that have
been developed to address the findings and conclusions included in the study
regarding the proposed development’s access needs and impacts on the
transportation system. Depending on the type of traffic study, presentation
of recommendations to the Planning Commission and/or City Council may proceed
as follows:



         (a)   For a traffic rezoning analysis, staff
recommendations will be presented as part of the staff report to the Planning
Commission and City Council as part of the proceedings on a rezoning or
land-use plan application;



         (b)   For a traffic impact report, a separate report
will be forwarded to the City Council for consideration of the
recommendations; and



         (c)   For a traffic design analysis, staff
recommendations will be presented as part of the staff report to the Planning
Commission or City Council for any land subdivision or general development
plan.



      (6)   Negotiations based on the conclusions and findings
resulting from the traffic impact report or analysis shall be held with the
City Council. A development agreement, detailing the applicant’s
responsibilities and the city’s responsibilities for implementing
identified mitigation measures, shall be prepared following the negotiations
for action by both parties.



   (J)   Report findings.



      (1)   If staff finds that the proposed development will not
meet applicable service-level standards, staff shall recommend one or more of
the following actions by the public or the applicant:



         (a)   Reduce the size, scale, scope or density of the
development to reduce traffic generation;



         (b)   Divide the project into phases and authorize only
one phase at a time until traffic capacity is adequate for the next phase of
development;



         (c)   Dedicate a right-of-way for street improvements;



         (d)   Construct new streets;



         (e)   Expand the capacity of existing streets;



         (f)   Redesign ingress and egress to the project to
reduce traffic conflicts;



         (g)   Alter the use and type of development to reduce
peak-hour traffic;



         (h)   Reduce background (existing) traffic;



         (i)   Eliminate the potential for additional traffic
generation from undeveloped properties in the vicinity of the proposed
development;



         (j)   Integrate design components (e.g., pedestrian and
bicycle paths or transit improvements) to reduce vehicular trip generation;



         (k)   Implement traffic demand management strategies
(e.g., carpool or vanpool programs, flex time, staggered work hours and
telecommuting) to reduce vehicular trip generation; and



         (l)   Recommend denial of the application for
development for which the traffic study is submitted.



      (2)   The Planning Commission may recommend, and the governing
board may adopt, a statement of principle partially or fully exempting a
project from meeting the traffic service standards where it finds that the
social and/or economic benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts
of the project. The City Council may temporarily exempt certain street
locations from some or all of the traffic service standards, owing to special
circumstances that make it undesirable or unfeasible to provide further
capacity improvements at these locations.



      (3)   These special circumstances may include a finding that
there would be significant negative fiscal, economic, social or environmental
impact from further construction, or that a significant portion of the
traffic is generated by development outside the control of the city. However,
where these conditions exist, the governing board will make every effort to
design alternate improvements, and development projects affecting these areas
may be required to implement traffic demand management programs and other
measures to reduce the impact on these locations as much as possible.

§ 153.0546  MEETINGS.



   The Planning Commission shall hold regularly scheduled public hearings
to receive and review public input on all legislative processes required by
this chapter. The Planning Commission shall recommend that the city approve,
approve with conditions or deny applications. If a comprehensive area, an UDC
amendment, a floating zone or a rezoning requiring final approval of the city
has been duly submitted to the Planning Commission, and the Planning
Commission has failed to convene a quorum or to make a recommendation
approving or denying such action at two consecutive meetings, such action, at
the option of the applicant, shall be deemed to be a negative recommendation.
The Code Enforcement Officer shall then submit the application to the city
for its consideration.

QUASI-JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE APPROVALS



§ 153.0560  QUASI-JUDICIAL PUBLIC HEARINGS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   This subdivision applies to any application for a master
development approval, CUP, variance, appeal, preliminary subdivision plat or
any other action pursuant to this chapter that is considered quasi-judicial
under state law. In making quasi-judicial decisions, decision-makers must
investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, weigh
evidence and draw conclusions from them, as a basis for their official
action, and exercise discretion of a judicial nature. In the land-use
context, these quasi-judicial decisions involve the application of land-use
policies to individual properties as opposed to the creation of policy.



      (2)   These decisions involve two key elements:



         (a)   The finding of facts regarding the specific
proposal; and



         (b)   The exercise of discretion in applying the
standards of this chapter.



      (3)   Due process requirements for quasi-judicial decisions
mandate that all fair trial standards be observed when these decisions are
made. This includes an evidentiary hearing with the right of the parties to
offer evidence; cross-examine adverse witnesses; inspect documents; have
sworn testimony; and have written findings of fact supported by competent,
substantial and material evidence.



   (B)   Conduct of hearing. Any person or persons may appear at a
public hearing and submit evidence, either individually or as a
representative. Each person who appears at a public hearing shall take a
proper oath and state, for the record, his or her name, address and, if
appearing on behalf of an organization or group, the name and mailing address
of the organization or group. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this section. At any point, members of the
agency conducting the hearing may ask questions of the applicant, staff or
public, or of any witness, or require cross-examination to be conducted
through questions submitted to the chairperson of the agency who will direct
the questions to the witness. The order of proceedings is as follows:



      (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer or designees shall present
a description of the proposed development and the relevant sections of plans
and ordinances involved, and set forth the legal or factual issues to be
determined. A written or oral recommendation may be given at the opening of
the hearing or, in complex cases, may be reserved by the Code Enforcement
Officer or designee until the close of the hearing in order to review the
testimonial and document any evidence. The recommendation shall address each
factor required by the UDC to be considered prior to development approval;



      (2)   The applicant shall present such information or evidence
that the applicant deems appropriate, subject to reasonable time limits
established by the agency;



      (3)   Public testimony, including expert or lay witnesses on
the applicant’s behalf, and relevant evidence shall be received;



      (4)   The Code Enforcement Officer or other staff member shall
not respond to any statement made by the applicant or any public comment
during the hearing, but may respond to questions from the agency concerning
any statements or evidence received during the deliberations of the agency;



      (5)   The applicant may reply to any testimony or evidence
presented by staff or the public; and



      (6)   The agency conducting the hearing shall close the public
portion of the hearing and conduct deliberations.



   (C)   Board of Adjustment. An agency conducting a quasi-judicial
hearing may appoint a Board of Adjustment to conduct the public hearing, make
findings of fact and conclusions of law and file a report with such findings
and conclusions to the agency for final action.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.6)



§ 153.0561  LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS.



   (A)   Generally; purpose and findings. The purpose of a legislative
hearing is to provide the public with an opportunity to be heard consistent
with procedures provided by statute. Unlike quasi-judicial hearings, a
legislative proceeding does not require due process protections, such as the
right of the parties to offer evidence, cross-examination, sworn testimony or
written findings of fact. Similar to quasi-judicial hearings, legislative
hearings are public hearings preceded by notice to interested parties. Public
hearings are required for legislative review hearings, such as amendments to
a Comprehensive Plan, amendments to this chapter (including zoning provisions
of this chapter and the zoning map) and applications for a proposed
development.



   (B)   Conduct of hearing. The order of the proceedings for a
legislative hearing shall be as set forth in § 153.0560 of this chapter.
Testimony may be presented by the applicant, and any member of the public,
but need not be submitted under oath or affirmation. The Planning Commission
or the city may establish a time limit for testimony and may limit testimony
where it is repetitive. Each appellate agency may adopt administrative
regulations and procedures governing the practice of that agency.



   (C)   Record of proceedings. The agency conducting the hearing shall
record the minutes of the proceedings by any appropriate means as prescribed
by rule and consistent with state law. Such record shall be provided at the
request of any person upon application to the City Clerk/Finance Director and
payment of a fee set by the city to cover the cost of duplication of the
transcribed record.



   (D)   Appeals.



      (1)   Applicability. Any person, including any officer or
agency of the city, aggrieved by a final development order relating to an
application for development approval by the Code Enforcement Officer or other
final decision-maker, may appeal such development order to the appellate body
designated by this chapter in the manner provided in this section.



      (2)   Notice of appeal. A notice of appeal shall be filed with
the appellate body within 30 days after the development order is filed. The
appeal shall contain a written statement of the reasons for which the
appellant claims the final decision is erroneous. The appeal shall be
accompanied by the fee established by the city.



      (3)   Time limit. The appellate body shall hear and decide the
appeal within at least 60 days after the filing of the appeal.

REVOCATION OF A DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL



§ 153.0575  INITIATION.



   The Code Enforcement Officer shall investigate alleged violations of
imposed condition or conditions. The Code Enforcement Officer shall determine
whether or not to terminate or suspend a development approval. If the Code
Enforcement Officer determines that a termination, or suspension, of a
development approval is appropriate, a recommendation, including the reason
or reasons for their determination, shall be made to the agency who shall
conduct a public hearing on the matter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.1)



§ 153.0576  GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION.



   The following are grounds for revocation of a development approval:



   (A)   The intentional provision of materially misleading information
by the applicant (the provision of information is considered
“intentional” where the applicant was aware of the inaccuracies or could
have discovered the inaccuracies with reasonable diligence); and



   (B)   The failure to comply with any condition of a development
approval.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.2)



§ 153.0577  NOTICE AND PUBLIC HEARING.



   Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the development approval
holder at least ten working days prior to the hearing. Said notice shall be
in writing and delivered by personal service or certified mail and shall
advise of the Code Enforcement Officer’s recommendation as well as the date
and location of the hearing before the agency.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.3)



§ 153.0578  DECISION AND NOTICE.



   The agency shall prepare a development order approving, approving with
conditions or denying the Code Enforcement Officer’s recommendation. The
development order shall contain findings that address the basis for the
decision. The development order shall state the condition or conditions that
have been violated and the harm such violation has caused. In the case of a
suspension of the use, the development order shall state the length of time
such violation can be cured. In the case of a termination, the development
order shall state the reason such violation cannot be cured.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.4)



§ 153.0579  APPEALS.



   An aggrieved party may appeal the agency’s decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction. The appeal shall be presented within the period of
time authorized by state statute.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.5)



§ 153.0580  RIGHT CUMULATIVE.



   The right to revoke a development approval, as provided in this
section, is cumulative to any other remedy allowed by law.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.8.6)



NEIGHBORHOOD REGISTRATION



§ 153.0595  APPLICABILITY.



   Neighborhood registration is established in order to provide
notification of neighborhoods involving legislative or quasi-judicial
development orders, as provided in other sections of this chapter. The
purpose of this section is to establish procedures for the registration of
neighborhoods and interested non- profit associations.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.9.1)



§ 153.0596  CONTENTS.

their addresses and phone numbers;



      (3)   A signed copy of the adopted by-laws;



      (4)   A regular meeting location and a regular meeting date;



      (5)   The date the association was founded;



      (6)   The number of association members;



      (7)   The approximate number of housing units in the area; and



      (8)   The approximate population of the neighborhood.



   (C)   The neighborhood association shall contact the City
Clerk/Finance Director in the event of a change in the above-referenced
information. An applicant shall be entitled to rely on the above-referenced
information for purposes of preparing any notices or otherwise contacting
neighborhood associations where required by this chapter.

§ 153.0597  EFFECT OF NEIGHBORHOOD REGISTRY.



   Upon a neighborhood association registration as provided herein, the
City Clerk/Finance Director shall notify the neighborhood association of any
application for rezoning or master site plan approval filed within the
boundaries of a registered neighborhood association. Individual citizens who
reside outside of the 200-foot notice area required by this chapter, but
within the boundaries of a registered neighborhood association, are
considered notified when any such notification is sent to the neighborhood
association within 200 feet of the subject site. This notice is a courtesy
and hearings may proceed despite claims of a lack of notice.

NEIGHBORHOOD PARTICIPATION MEETING



§ 153.0610  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   The purpose of citizen participation is to:



   (A)   Encourage applicants to pursue early and effective
communication with the affected public in conjunction with applications,
giving the applicant an opportunity to understand and attempt to mitigate any
documentable adverse impact of the proposed project on the adjoining
community and to educate and inform the public;



   (B)   Provide citizens and property owners of affected areas with an
opportunity to learn about applications and to work with applicants to
resolve concerns at an early stage of the process; and



   (C)   Facilitate ongoing communication between the applicants,
interested citizens, property owners, city staff, boards and commissions and
elected officials throughout the application review process.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.10)



§ 153.0611  APPLICABILITY.



   It is the policy of the city to encourage applicants to meet with
surrounding neighborhoods prior to filing an application for a development
approval requiring review and a public hearing. Neighborhood review is
mandatory for any application for any quasi-judicial development order that
would allow for the creation of 90 or more dwelling units. The applicant at
their option may elect to include citizen participation as a preparatory step
in the development process for ministerial development orders. Inclusion of
citizen participation prior to required public hearings will be noted by the
reviewing agency when considering the need for a continuance. This section
requires neighborhood meetings prior to submission of an application and
documentation of efforts that have been made to resolve any potential
concerns prior to the formal application process.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.10.1; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.0612  RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Meetings. When required by this chapter, the applicant shall
facilitate at least one meeting with surrounding neighborhoods before
formally filing an application.



   (B)   Target area. The target area shall include the following:



      (1)   Property owners within the public hearing notice area
required by statute; and



      (2)   A neighborhood association that includes the subject
property and/or is within 200 feet of the subject property, and is registered
with the City Clerk/Finance Director in accordance with the requirements of
§§ 153.0595 and 153.0596 of this chapter.



   (C)   Citizen participation documentation. Citizen participation
shall include the following information as required in § 153.1645 of this
chapter.



   (D)   Report on implementation of citizen participation. The
applicant shall provide a written report on the results of its citizen
participation efforts with the filing of the application. The report shall be
forwarded to the reviewing agency. At a minimum, the citizen participation
report shall include details of techniques the applicant used to involve the
public, including:



      (1)   Dates and locations of all meetings where citizens were
invited to discuss the applicant’s proposal;



      (2)   Content, dates mailed and numbers of mailings, including
letters, meeting notices, newsletters and other publications;



      (3)   Where residents, property owners, and interested parties
receiving notices, newsletters or other written materials are located;



      (4)   The number of people who participated in the process;



      (5)   A summary of concerns, issues and problems expressed
during the process;



      (6)   How the applicant has addressed or intends to address
concerns, issues and problems expressed during the process; and



      (7)   Concerns, issues and problems the applicant is unable to
address, including reasons why the concerns cannot or should not be addressed.



   (E)   Signature or affidavit of compliance. If the applicant
prepares a citizen participation report, the report shall include a list of
persons contacted, a list of persons invited to any neighborhood meeting, and
one of the following:



      (1)   The signature of the president or vice president of any
neighborhood association required to be contacted, certifying that the
neighborhood meeting was conducted; provided, however, that, the signature
need not certify agreement with the applicant as to any issues raised at the
neighborhood meeting;



      (2)   If the president or vice president of the neighborhood
association was unavailable or refused to sign such certification, a
statement as to the efforts to contact them and, in the event of
unavailability, the reasons as to why they were unable to sign the
certification; or



      (3)   A statement that there are no registered neighborhood
associations within the required notification area.



   (F)   Restrictions on continuances. It is the intent of this chapter
to encourage applicants to involve neighborhoods in the development approval
process while, at the same time, streamlining the development approval
process through the discouragement of continuances and frivolous appeals by
neighbors or neighborhood associations. Accordingly, any person who received
notice of a neighborhood meeting and who failed to participate in a
neighborhood meeting shall not be permitted:



      (1)   A continuance of any hearing relating to a development
approval application requiring a public hearing; or



      (2)   To file an administrative appeal from any development
order approving the application on any issue that was resolved at a
neighborhood meeting. For the purpose of this section, persons will be
considered to have “received notice” if their names appear on the
invitation list.

MINISTERIAL DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS



§ 153.0625  DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL.



   A development approval is a ministerial development approval, including
a building permit, that authorizes construction of a structure or improvement
or disturbance of land. No land shall be disturbed and no building or
structure shall be erected, added to or structurally altered within the
zoning jurisdiction until a development approval has been issued by the Code
Enforcement Officer. All development approvals shall comply with the
requirements of the UDC. No grading approval, building permit, certificate of
appropriateness or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building
or structure or for any land disturbance where said construction, addition,
alteration or use violates any provision of the UDC, except upon written
order of the Board of Appeals.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.11)



§ 153.0626  GRADING AND LAND DISTURBANCE.



   (A)   Grading development approval. Separate grading development
approval is required for disturbances of land that require the removal of
more than ten cubic feet of soil and less than 100 cubic feet of soil prior
to the issuance of any development approval.



   (B)   Land disturbance activity. Any disturbance of land greater
than 100 cubic feet of soil requires a development approval pursuant to §
153.1362 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.12)



§ 153.0627  ZONING CERTIFICATES.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. The purpose of this section is to
prescribe procedures for development approvals that do not require
quasi-judicial or legislative notice or a public hearing. A public hearing is
not required for development approvals set forth in this section for one or
more of the following reasons:



      (1)   If required, public hearings have already been conducted
relating to the development approval application, and the development
approval application procedure is designed to ensure that the proposed use
complies with a previously approved subdivision plat, site plan, specific
plan, Comprehensive Plan amendment or conditional rezoning (e.g., development
approval or certificate of occupancy);



      (2)   The proposed use is permitted as a right in the
applicable zoning district (e.g., development approval or certificate of
occupancy); and



      (3)   The proposed use is subject to expedited review in order
to avoid an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech (e.g., sexually
oriented businesses or signs) or because of federal law (e.g.,
telecommunications development approval).



   (B)   Initiation. The applicant shall file a complete application
for a zoning certificate with the Code Enforcement Officer. If site plan
review is required in accordance with §§ 153.0610 through 153.0612 of this
chapter, the approved site plan shall be submitted with the application. An
application is available from the Code Enforcement Office. If the proposed
development or development activity is not subject to site plan review, the
application shall include the information required by §§ 153.1645 through
153.1658 of this chapter.



   (C)   Completeness review. The Code Enforcement Officer shall review
an application for completeness within two working days. The appellate agency
for purposes of completeness review is the Board of Adjustment.



   (D)   Decision. The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the
application for conformance with the UDC. Within 15 working days of receipt
of a complete application, the Code Enforcement Officer shall approve,
approve with conditions or deny the application for a zoning certificate.
Applications that are denied shall have the reasons for denial, in writing,
attached to the application. If the Code Enforcement Officer fails to render
a decision relating to the application within this time period, the
application shall be deemed approved. The applicant and the city may agree to
extend the response time contained in this section.



   (E)   Approval criteria. The zoning certificate shall be issued by
the Code Enforcement Officer only if the application complies with all
applicable provisions of the UDC and any approved CUP, conditional rezoning
or site plan.



   (F)   Amendments. Any revision to an application for a zoning
certificate shall be processed in the same manner as the original application.



   (G)   Scope of approval. The zoning certificate shall be valid for a
period of 180 days.



   (H)   Recording procedures. An application for a zoning certificate
shall be maintained in the files of the Code Enforcement Office. The
applicant shall maintain an original signed copy of the approved zoning
certificate.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.13)



§ 153.0628  CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.



   (A)   Requirement. All uses, including non-conforming uses, shall
obtain a certificate of occupancy where required by the Uniform Building Code
or other applicable national building code, state law and this chapter. All
of the requirements and conditions contained in any development approvals
applicable to the property, including zoning, site plan and subdivision final
plat approval, that have not been met at the time of the issuance of the
development approval, shall be required to have been met before the issuance
of any certificate of occupancy.



   (B)   Records. The Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain a record
of all ministerial development orders. Copies shall be furnished, upon
request, to any person upon the payment of a fee established by the city.

DIVISION 8: ZONING PROCEDURES



PLANS AND PLAN AMENDMENTS



§ 153.0640  PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED.



   This section establishes uniform procedures for the preparation or
amendment of the Comprehensive Plan. Where the existing Comprehensive Plan
does not provide sufficient densities, or where the goals and objectives do
not support a proposed development, these procedures may be used to apply for
an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20)



§ 153.0641  APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   Generally. This section applies to any amendment to the
Comprehensive Plan or to the preparation or amendment of a specific plan or
neighborhood plan.



   (B)   Specific plans.



      (1)   A specific plan accompanying the development of specific
property or properties provides a bridge between the comprehensive, area and
neighborhood plan policies, and specific regulations, and which may be
approved to permit mixed-use and planned development.



      (2)   A specific plan is considered an amendment to, and a
part of, the Comprehensive Plan. A specific plan shall include text and a
diagram or diagrams that specify all of the following in detail:



         (a)   The distribution, location and extent of the uses
of land, including open space, within the area covered by the specific plan
or any applicable area plan;



         (b)   The proposed distribution, location and extent and
intensity of major components of public and private transportation, sewage,
water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy and other essential facilities
proposed to be located within the area covered by the specific plan and
needed to support the land uses described in the specific plan;



         (c)   Standards and criteria by which development will
proceed, and standards for the conservation, development and utilization of
natural resources, where applicable;



         (d)   A program of implementation measures, including
zoning, land development regulations, programs, public works projects,
financing measures, development agreements and conditions, covenants and
regulations necessary to carry out subsections (B)(2)(a), (B)(2)(b) and
(B)(2)(c) above; and



         (e)   A statement of the relationship of the specific
plan to the Comprehensive Plan.



   (C)   Area plans. An area plan is a plan that provides specific
planning, design and implementation, for a defined geographic area of the
city to guide specific development applications, governmental facilities,
official maps, utility and infrastructure plans, annexations and creation of
special districts.



   (D)   Neighborhood plans.



      (1)   A NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN means a plan that guides the
platting or development of remaining vacant parcels in a partially built-up
neighborhood in order to make reasonable use of all land, correlate street
patterns and achieve the best possible land-use relationships.



      (2)   A neighborhood plan is considered an amendment to, and a
part of, the Comprehensive Plan. A neighborhood plan may provide more
detailed guidance about applying the future land-use map of the Comprehensive
Plan to a specific neighborhood.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.1)



§ 153.0642  INITIATION.



   (A)   A property owner or his or her designated representative may
initiate a comprehensive area, specific, or neighborhood plan amendment. The
applicant may combine an application for an amendment to the Comprehensive
Plan with an application for approval of a rezoning, and said applications
may be processed concurrently.



   (B)   Before any application is made, the applicant shall schedule a
pre-application conference with the Code Enforcement Officer to discuss, in
general, the procedures and requirements for a Comprehensive Plan amendment
request pursuant to these regulations.



   (C)   An application for a comprehensive area, specific or
neighborhood plan amendment shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer
and shall contain the information set forth in §§ 153.1645 through 153.1658
of this chapter.



   (D)   The Planning Commission, the city, the Code Enforcement
Officer, a property owner, a neighborhood association or the owner of any
business located in the city may initiate a request for an amendment to the
future land-use maps of the Comprehensive Plan. The application for amendment
of the future land-use map may be accompanied by an application for a zoning
district map amendment. By resolution, the city may establish a schedule
prescribing when and how frequently Comprehensive Plan text amendments will
be considered.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.2)



§ 153.0643  COMPLETENESS REVIEW.



   The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the Comprehensive Plan
amendment application and shall determine if the application is complete
pursuant to this section. The Code Enforcement Officer shall inform the
applicant of the status of the completeness of the application. If the Code
Enforcement Officer determines that the application is incomplete, the
application shall be returned to the applicant along with the requisite fees.
The applicant shall be instructed as to the reasons for the incompleteness of
the application and informed of the schedule for the next application period.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.3)



§ 153.0644  DECISION.



   The Planning Commission shall hold a legislative public hearing and
shall render its decision in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§
153.0545 through 153.0548 of this chapter. The city shall hold a public
hearing and shall render its decision in accordance with the procedures set
forth in §§ 153.0545 through 153.0548 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.4)



§ 153.0645  CRITERIA.



   In determining whether the proposed amendment shall be approved, the
Planning Commission and city shall consider the factors set forth in state
statutes. No specific plan or neighborhood plan will be approved unless it is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.5)



§ 153.0646  SCOPE OF APPROVAL.



   (A)   The approval of an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan does
not authorize the use, occupancy or development of property.



   (B)   The approval of a plan amendment shall require the applicant
to apply for zoning changes and/or subdivision or site plan approval
consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.20.6)



CODE AMENDMENTS



§ 153.0660  INTRODUCTION.



   This section provides uniform procedures for the amendment of the UDC
or the official zoning map by the city whenever the public necessity,
convenience, general welfare or good planning practice so requires.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21)



§ 153.0661  APPLICABILITY.



   The provisions of this subdivision apply to any application to:



   (A)   Revise the text of the UDC; or



   (B)   Reclassify a tract, parcel or land area from one zoning
district to another.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.1)



§ 153.0662  INITIATION.



   (A)   All petitions, applications, recommendations or proposals for
changes in the zoning district classification of property (referred to as a
“rezoning”) or for changes in the text of the UDC shall be filed with the
Code Enforcement Officer.



   (B)   Text amendments may be proposed by any person.



   (C)   A proposed rezoning may be initiated by:



      (1)   The city or Planning Commission by resolution; or



      (2)   An application properly signed and filed by the owner
or, with the owner’s specific written consent, a contract purchaser or
owner’s agent of a property included within the boundaries of a proposed
rezoning, unless otherwise provided by the UDC. The applicant may file an
application for subdivision plat approval concurrent with an application for
a rezoning.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.2)



§ 153.0663  COMPLETENESS REVIEW.



   The Code Enforcement Officer shall conduct a completeness review as set
forth in § 153.0497 of this chapter within two working days of application
submittal. The appellate agency for purposes of completeness review is the
Planning Commission.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.3)



§ 153.0664  DECISION.



   (A)   Generally. Upon certification by the Code Enforcement Officer
that the application is complete and required fees have been paid, the
application shall be deemed complete and referred to the Planning Commission
for its review and recommendation.



   (B)   Type of hearing. The public hearings before the Planning
Commission and the city shall be conducted as legislative hearings.



   (C)   Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall hold at
least one public hearing on such application, and as a result thereof shall
transmit its final report to the city. All applications for a change in
zoning that have been considered by the Planning Commission shall be
presented by the applicant to the city within six months from the date of the
Planning Commission’s final consideration.



   (D)   City. After receipt of the final report of the Planning
Commission, the city shall approve or deny the rezoning or text amendment. If
the proposed rezoning is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, a specific
plan or a neighborhood plan, an application for an amendment to the
Comprehensive Plan, specific plan or neighborhood plan shall be submitted by
the applicant. Amendments to the official zoning map and the Comprehensive
Plan, specific plan or neighborhood plan may be considered concurrently.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.4)



§ 153.0665  APPROVAL CRITERIA.



   (A)   Generally. In its review of an application for rezoning, the
city shall consider the criteria as defined in subsections (B) through (H)
below. No single factor is controlling; instead, each must be weighed in
relation to the other standards.



   (B)   Consistency. Rezoning shall be consistent with the adopted
Comprehensive Plan.



   (C)   Adverse impacts on neighboring lands. The city shall consider
the nature and degree of an adverse impact upon neighboring lands. Lots shall
not be rezoned in a way that is substantially inconsistent with the uses of
the surrounding area, whether more or less restrictive. Further, the city
finds and determines that vast acreages of single-use zoning produces
uniformity with adverse consequences, such as traffic congestion, air
pollution and social alienation. Accordingly, rezonings may promote mixed
uses subject to a high degree of design control.



   (D)   Suitability as presently zoned. The city shall consider the
suitability or unsuitability of the tract for its use as presently zoned.
This factor, like the others, must often be weighed in relation to the other
standards, and instances can exist in which the use for which land is zoned
may be rezoned upon proof of a real public need, substantially changed
conditions in the neighborhood or to effectuate important goals, objectives,
policies and strategies of the Comprehensive Plan, specification or UDC.



   (E)   Health, safety and welfare. The amendatory ordinance must bear
a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals or general
welfare, or protect and preserve historical and cultural places and areas.
The rezoning ordinance may be justified, however, if a substantial public
need or purpose exists, and this is so even if the private owner of the tract
will also benefit.



   (F)   Public policy. Certain public policies in favor of the
rezoning may be considered. Examples include a need for affordable housing,
economic development, mixed-use development or sustainable environmental
features, which are consistent with neighborhood, area or specific plans.



   (G)   Size of tract. The city shall consider the size, shape and
characteristics of the tract in relation to the affected neighboring lands.
Amendatory ordinances shall not rezone a single lot when there have been no
intervening changes or other saving characteristics. Proof that a small tract
is unsuitable for use as zoned, or that there have been substantial changes
in the immediate area, may justify an amendatory ordinance.



   (H)   Other factors. The city may consider any other factors
relevant to a rezoning application under state law.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.5)



§ 153.0666  SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Applicability. The provisions of this section do not apply to
any application for a rezoning that is initiated by the city.



   (B)   Withdrawal after Planning Commission hearing. No rezoning
application shall be received or filed with the Planning Commission if,
during the previous six months, an application was received or filed and
withdrawn after a full, fair, complete and final hearing occurred on the
rezoning before the Planning Commission. However, if the applicant certifies
with a sworn affidavit that the evidence is new, relevant and substantial,
and could not have been secured at the time set for the original hearing, the
Planning Commission may hear and consider the application.



   (C)   Denial of rezoning. No application for rezoning shall be
received or filed with the Planning Commission within one year after the city
has denied an application for rezoning of the same property.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.6)



§ 153.0667  AMENDMENTS.



   Any subsequent rezoning requires a new application and shall be
processed as set forth in §§ 153.0660 through 153.0666 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.7)



§ 153.0668  SCOPE OF APPROVAL.



   An amendment to the UDC or a rezoning does not authorize the
development of land. An amendment authorizes the applicant to apply for
development approval consisting of a development approval, in the case of
uses permitted as of right; a CUP, in the case of uses designated as
conditional uses within the applicable zoning district; or to proceed with
site plan or subdivision plat approval. An amendment does not supersede any
requirement for site plan or subdivision plat approval by the UDC.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.8)



§ 153.0669  RECORDING PROCEDURES.



   When the amendment involves changes to the existing zoning district
boundaries, the form of the amending ordinance shall contain a narrative
description of the land to be reclassified or reference to an accompanying
plat of such land showing the new zoning classifications and indicating their
boundaries. The Code Enforcement Officer shall refer to the attested
ordinance as a record of the current zoning status until such time as the
zoning map can be changed.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.21.9)



CONDITIONAL ZONING



§ 153.0680  PURPOSE.



   The conditional zoning procedure is designed to provide for a land use
within an area that is not permitted by the established zoning district but,
due to individual site considerations or unique development requirements,
would be compatible with adjacent land uses under given conditions. The
granting of a conditional zoning classification shall not be for all of the
uses permitted in a given district but only for the specific use named in the
ordinance approving the conditional zoning district.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22)



§ 153.0681  APPLICABILITY.



   This section applies to any application for reclassification of a
tract, parcel or land area to a conditional zoning district. A conditional
zoning district may also be applied as an overlay zoning district to any base
zoning district.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.1)



§ 153.0682  INITIATION.



   (A)   A proceeding for approval of a conditional zoning district
shall be initiated by filing an application with the Code Enforcement
Officer. The application shall be signed and filed by the owner or, with the
owner’s specific written consent, a contract purchaser or owner’s agent
of a property included within the boundaries of a proposed conditional
rezoning. The application for a conditional use district shall be the same as
that for a change in the base zoning district. If the requested use or uses
is listed as a conditional use within the conditional zoning district, the
approval of a conditional zoning district shall constitute approval of the
conditional use.



   (B)   A conditional zoning district may be granted as an amendment
to an ongoing rezoning case before the Planning Commission or the city.
Before granting the amendment, the city may issue a courtesy notice to
affected parties of the proposed conditional zoning district and will not
require the applicant to submit a new application or pay additional fees
other than for the difference (if any) between a conventional case and a
conditional zoning case. Such amendment shall then be considered at the next
regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting or, in the case of the city,
at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which zoning cases will be
considered. All costs associated with issuance of the courtesy notice shall
be borne by the city.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.2)



§ 153.0683  COMPLETENESS REVIEW.



   The Code Enforcement Officer shall conduct a completeness review as set
forth in §§ 153.0510 through 153.0519 of this chapter. The appellate agency
for purposes of a completeness review is the Planning Commission.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.3)



§ 153.0684  DECISION.



   (A)   The procedure for approving a conditional zoning
classification is the same as is required for a rezoning and as further
provided in this section.



   (B)   In approving the conditional zoning classification, the city
may impose such requirements and safeguards as indicated by § 153.0685 of
this chapter and may specifically authorize the location of uses, subject to
the requirements set forth.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.4)



§ 153.0685  CRITERIA.



   (A)   Generally. Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to
the contrary, a conditional zoning district may be permitted as provided in
this section so long as the criteria for approval of a rezoning are met.



   (B)   Development constraints (generally).



      (1)   In considering a request for a conditional zoning
classification, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the
city with reference to the use and development conditions that ensure
compatibility with surrounding properties and environmental conditions.
COMPATIBILITY means the compatibility of the proposed use with surrounding
uses, including building character, construction material or architectural
design of the proposed structures.



      (2)   The following development constraints may be attached as
conditions to the rezoning:



         (a)   Range of allowable uses;



         (b)   Protective screening and/or buffering of property
perimeter;



         (c)   Protective screening/location of dumpsters,
mechanical systems and loading docks;



         (d)   Landscaping relative to screening, buffering and
ingress/egress control and not solely for beautification purposes;



         (e)   Lighting;



         (f)   Height limitations;



         (g)   Setbacks;



         (h)   Parking (the location of parking and, in some
instances, reduction in the amount of parking to be allowed);



         (i)   Ingress/egress;



         (j)   Hours of operation for conditional uses permitted
in, or adjacent to, residential zoning districts;



         (k)   Signage;



         (l)   Performance standards relative to air pollution,
noise, glare and heat, vibration, noxious odors, toxic and liquid wastes,
fire and explosion, radioactivity and electromagnetic radiation;



         (m)   Protection of environmentally sensitive areas,
including, but not limited to, steep slopes, wetlands, habitats, riparian
areas and geological formations; and



         (n)   The proposed uses to the maximum extent feasible,
which utilize sustainability features authorized by the UDC.



   (C)   Development constraints in residential districts. The
following conditions apply to the operation of non-residential conditional
uses permitted within any residential district, unless otherwise approved by
the city.



      (1)   There shall be no exterior display or sign with the
exception that a nameplate, not exceeding three square feet in area, may be
permitted when attached to the front of the main structure.



      (2)   No construction features shall place the structure out
of character with the surrounding neighborhood.



      (3)   Business or office hours of operations shall not be
permitted before 7:00 a.m. or after 6:00 p.m.



   (D)   Variances prohibited. A variance shall not be granted to any
development constraint specified in this section or to any condition imposed
by the city.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.5)



§ 153.0686  SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Applicability. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply
to any application for a rezoning that is initiated by the city.



   (B)   Withdrawal after Planning Commission hearing.



      (1)   No rezoning application shall be received or filed with
the Planning Commission if, during the previous six months, an application
was received or filed and withdrawn after a full, fair, complete and final
hearing occurred on the rezoning before the Planning Commission.



      (2)   However, if the applicant certifies with a sworn
affidavit that the evidence is new, relevant and substantial, and could not
have been secured at the time set for the original hearing, the Planning
Commission may hear and consider the application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.6)



§ 153.0687  AMENDMENTS.



   (A)   New or different uses. An amendment to a conditional zoning
district to authorize a new or different use shall require a new application
for a rezoning to a conditional zoning district.



   (B)   Expansion. Expansion of the building area, land area or
intensity of the conditional zoning classification for a property granted a
conditional zoning classification is not permitted unless authorized by the
city after consideration of an application for a new conditional zoning
classification.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.7)



§ 153.0688  SCOPE OF APPROVAL.



   (A)   Compliance with development constraints.



      (1)   The city may grant a conditional zoning classification
subject to such development constraints as the city deems necessary to
protect the public health, safety or welfare. The city may specify that
compliance with certain conditions must be achieved prior to the issuance of
a certificate of occupancy.



      (2)   Violation of any condition, subsequent to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, may result in initiation of a rezoning of the
property to its base zoning classification and judicial and/or administrative
action by the city.



   (B)   Time period.



      (1)   A conditional zoning classification shall run with the
land until such time that the zoning is changed or the conditional use
granted has been discontinued on the property for a period of 12 months.



      (2)   However, the city may impose a time limitation on a
conditional zoning classification granted in a single-family residential
district. Failure to renew the conditional zoning classification prior to the
date of its expiration may cause the conditional use to expire and the
conditional use to terminate on that date.



      (3)   The Code Enforcement Officer may then initiate
proceedings to rezone the property to its former zoning classification.



   (C)   Base zoning district regulations apply. A conditional zoning
classification does not permit the applicant to use the subject property for
uses other than those requested in the application for a conditional zoning
classification. The granting of a conditional zoning classification does not
waive the regulations of the underlying zoning district.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.22.8)



§ 153.0689  RECORDING PROCEDURES.



   A conditional zoning classification shall be recorded in the same
manner as a rezoning. The conditional zoning classification shall be
indicated by the symbols “CD” following the zoning district designation
of, for example, “O-CD”. A flow chart of the conditional zoning district
process is shown in Figure 153.0689(A) below.

CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS



§ 153.0700  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   This subdivision provides for certain uses that, because of
unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not
permitted in zoning districts as a matter of right, but which may, under
appropriate standards and factors set forth in the UDC, be approved. These
uses shall be permitted through the issuance of a CUP within a site plan
adopted by the Planning Commission after ensuring that the use can be
appropriately accommodated on the specific property; that it will conform to
the Comprehensive Plan; that it can be constructed and operated in a manner
that is compatible with the surrounding land uses and overall character of
the community; and that the public interest, health, safety and general
welfare will be promoted.



   (B)   No inherent right exists to receive a CUP. Such authorization
must be approved under a specific set of circumstances and conditions. Each
application and situation is unique. Every CUP amendment or application shall
at a minimum be required to comply with every requirement contained in each
chapter of the UDC. Mere compliance with the generally applicable
requirements however may not be sufficient, and additional measures and
conditions may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed
development.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23)



§ 153.0701  CONDITIONAL APPLICABILITY.



   The provisions of this subdivision apply to any application for
approval of a CUP. Conditional uses are those uses that are generally
compatible with the land uses permitted by right in a zoning district but
that require individual review of their location, design and configuration,
and the imposition of conditions or mitigations in order to ensure the
appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning
district. Only those uses that are enumerated as conditional uses in a zoning
district, as set forth in the zoning regulations, shall be authorized by the
Planning Commission. A CUP is not required for a use permitted by right in a
given zoning district.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.1)



§ 153.0702  INITIATION.



   An owner of real property, or that owner’s authorized representative,
may apply for a CUP for that property by filing an application with the Code
Enforcement Officer. The application shall include the material required in
§§ 153.1645 through 153.1658 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.2)



§ 153.0703  COMPLETENESS REVIEW.



   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the application for
the CUP for completeness in accordance with § 153.0497 of this chapter.



   (B)   The review agency for purposes of completeness review (§
153.0497 of this chapter) shall be the Planning Commission.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.3)



§ 153.0704  APPROVAL.



   (A)   Generally. When the Code Enforcement Officer has certified
that the application is complete, it shall be deemed received and shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for its review and decision. The Planning
Commission, after public notice in accordance with applicable state laws,
shall hold at least one public hearing on the application. The Planning
Commission may concurrently process and review a rezoning site plan,
subdivision approval and CUP.



   (B)   Type of hearing. The public hearing before the Planning
Commission and the city shall be conducted as a quasi-judicial hearing.



   (C)   Conditions. In approving any CUP, the Planning Commission may:



      (1)   Impose such reasonable standards, conditions or
requirements, in addition to or that supersede any standard specified in the
UDC, as it may deem necessary to protect the public interest and welfare.
Such additional standards may include, but need not be limited to:



         (a)   Financing and availability of adequate public
facilities or services;



         (b)   Dedication of land;



         (c)   Reservation of land;



         (d)   Payment of exactions;



         (e)   Impact fees;



         (f)   Creation of special assessment districts;



         (g)   Creation of restrictive covenants or easements;



         (h)   Special setbacks;



         (i)   Yard requirements;



         (j)   Increased screening or landscaping requirements;



         (k)   Area requirements;



         (l)   Development phasing; and



         (m)   Standards pertaining to traffic, circulation,
noise, lighting, hours of operation, protection of environmentally sensitive
areas and similar characteristics.



      (2)   Require that a performance guarantee - acceptable in
form, content and amount to the City Attorney - be posted by the applicant to
ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements as may be
specified; and



      (3)   Require that a development agreement be entered into by
the applicant.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.4)



§ 153.0705  APPROVAL CRITERIA.



   A conditional use is permitted only if the applicant demonstrates that:



   (A)   The proposed conditional use shall comply with all regulations
of the applicable zoning district; Divisions 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this
chapter; and any applicable supplemental use regulations as set forth in
Division 15 of this chapter;



   (B)   The proposed conditional use shall conform to the character of
the neighborhood within the same zoning district in which it is located. The
proposal as submitted or modified shall have no more adverse effects on
health, safety or comfort of persons living or working in the neighborhood,
or shall be no more injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood
than would any other use generally permitted in the same district. In making
such a determination, consideration shall be given to:



      (1)   The location, type and height of buildings or structures;



      (2)   The type and extent of landscaping and screening on the
site; and



      (3)   Whether the proposed use is consistent with any policy
of the Comprehensive Plan that encourages mixed uses and/or densities.



   (C)   Adequate utilities shall be provided as set forth in Divisions
11, 12, 13 and 14 of this chapter;



   (D)   Adequate measures shall be taken to provide ingress and egress
so designed as to minimize traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion
on the public roads;



   (E)   The proposed use shall not be noxious or offensive by reason
of vibration, noise, odor, dust, smoke or gas;



   (F)   The proposed use shall not injure the use and enjoyment of the
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted nor
substantially diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood;



   (G)   The proposed use shall not impede the orderly development and
improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted within the zoning
district;



   (H)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the proposed
use shall not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort or general welfare;



   (I)   The public interest and welfare supporting the proposed use
shall be sufficient to outweigh the individual interests that are adversely
affected by the establishment of the proposed use; and



   (J)   The proposed uses and structures comply with the
sustainability requirements of the UDC.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.5)



§ 153.0706  SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   An application for a CUP may be withdrawn at any time. If the
application has been advertised in compliance with state law, an application
requesting substantially the same use on all or part of the same described
land shall not be reconsidered within one year of withdrawal.



   (B)   No application for a CUP for any lot or parcel that requests
the same use and same conditions shall be considered within one year of a
final decision denying the application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.6)



§ 153.0707  AMENDMENTS.



   (A)   Minor amendments. An amendment is a request for any
enlargement, expansion, increase in intensity, relocation, or modification of
any condition of a previously approved and currently valid CUP. Amendments
shall be processed as follows: shifts in on-site location and changes in
size, shape, intensity or configuration of less than 5%, or a 5% or less
increase in either impervious surface or floor area over what was originally
approved, may be authorized by the Code Enforcement Officer; provided that,
such minor changes comply with the following criteria:



      (1)   No previous minor modification has been granted pursuant
to this section;



      (2)   There will be no detrimental impact on any adjacent
property caused by significant change in the appearance or use of the
property or any other contributing factor;



      (3)   Nothing in the currently valid CUP precludes or
otherwise limits such expansion or enlargement; and



      (4)   The proposal conforms to the UDC and is in keeping with
the spirit and intent of any adopted Comprehensive Plan.



   (B)   Major amendments. Any proposed amendment other than those
provided for in subsection (A) above are considered a major amendment and
shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as are
applicable to the issuance of the original development approval.



   (C)   Non-conforming uses. For an existing and currently valid
conditional use that is no longer allowed as a conditional use in the zoning
district in which it is located, the city, upon receipt of an application,
may review and approve an amendment to said development approval; provided
that, such amendment does not allow the use to be enlarged, expanded,
increased in intensity, relocated or continued beyond any limitation
specified in the existing use development approval or established in
Divisions 17 and 18 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.7)



§ 153.0708  SCOPE OF APPROVAL.



   (A)   Once a CUP is granted, such use may be enlarged, extended,
increased in intensity or relocated only in accordance with this section
unless the city, in approving the initial development approval, has
specifically established alternative procedures for consideration of future
expansion or enlargement.



   (B)   The provisions of Divisions 17 and 18 of this chapter,
relative to expansion of non-conforming uses, do not supersede this
requirement unless the conditionally permitted use for which the development
approval was initially granted is no longer a use permitted as of right or as
a conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.23.8)

APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 153.0745  GENERAL.



   This section establishes the general rules and regulations governing
plats, the subdivision of land and the procedures for the extension of the
city’s streets, major thoroughfares and public utilities.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.30)



§ 153.0746  SUBDIVISIONS SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION.



   (A)   The owner or proprietor of any tract of land who desires to
subdivide land (i.e., to create a “subdivision”) within the corporate
boundaries of the city or within one and one-half miles of the corporate
boundaries of the city shall submit a plat of such subdivision to the Code
Enforcement Officer. No person shall subdivide land without making and
recording a plat and complying fully with this chapter. No person shall sell
or transfer ownership of any lot or parcel of land by reference to a plat of
a subdivision before such plat has been duly recorded with the Register of
Deeds, unless such subdivision was created prior to the adoption of this
chapter. No development approval or certificate of occupancy shall be issued
for any plat, map or plan that was created prior to subdivision approval
under the UDC, or for any parcel or plat of land that was created by
subdivision after the effective date of the UDC, and no excavation of land or
construction of any public or private improvements shall be commenced, except
in conformity with the requirements of the UDC.



   (B)   A final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer before the subdivision of a parcel may be recorded. No
land may be subdivided through the use of any legal description other than
with reference to a plat approved by the Code Enforcement Officer in
accordance with these regulations.



   (C)   The Code Enforcement Officer may review and approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the sale, lease or development of lands
subdivided prior to or following the effective date of these regulations
where:



      (1)   The applicant proposes to combine or to recombine
previously subdivided and recorded lots, and the total number of lots will
increase or does not meet the standards of the UDC; or



      (2)   The original subdivider or their successor failed to
complete subdivision improvement requirements pursuant to a subdivision
improvement agreement entered into when the plat for the subdivided land was
approved, and the plat contains contiguous lots in common ownership where one
or more of the contiguous lots are undeveloped. This subsection applies
whether the lots are owned by the original subdivider or an immediate or
remote grantee from the original subdivider. This subsection (C)(2) does not
apply if the city has obtained possession of sufficient funds from security
provided by the subdivider with which to complete construction of
improvements in the subdivision.

§ 153.0747  EXEMPTIONS.



   A subdivision plat is not required for any of the following:



   (A)   The combination or recombination of portions of previously
subdivided and recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased
and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the city;



   (B)   The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the
widening or opening of streets; and



   (C)   If a court orders the partition of land by dividing the same
among the owners; provided that, the city is made a party defendant to said
action and gives its consent.

§ 153.0753  DEDICATION (ACCEPTANCE).



   The approval of a plat shall not be considered an acceptance of any
proposed dedication and does not impose on the city any duty regarding the
maintenance or improvement of any dedicated parts until the appropriate city
authorities make an actual appropriation of the dedicated parts by entry, use
or improvement. The disapproval of a plat shall be considered a refusal by
the city of the offered dedication indicated on the plat.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.38)



PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURES



§ 153.0765  GENERAL.



   The preliminary plat serves as a guide to the density, intensity, land
uses, pedestrian and bicycle ways, trails, parks, open space and future lot,
street and drainage patterns established for a site in the platting process.
It is the intent of the preliminary plat requirement to ensure that a
landowner investigates the broad effects that development of property will
have on the site itself as well as on adjacent properties and public
infrastructure systems. Approval of a preliminary plat shall constitute
acceptance of the land-use mix, development intensity, general street
patterns, drainage patterns, lot patterns, parks and open space lands and the
general layout of pedestrian and bicycle trails; provided that, these may be
modified in conjunction with subsequent approvals if additional information
reveals development constraints that are not evident during preliminary plat
review.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.33)



§ 153.0766  APPLICABILITY.



   Approval of a preliminary plat is required for any site where the
eventual platting of the property involves a major subdivision. No final plat
shall be approved until a preliminary plat for the property has been
approved, unless the application is for a minor subdivision.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.33.1)



§ 153.0767  INITIATION.



   A preliminary plat shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer and
shall contain the information required by §§ 153.1645 through 153.1658 of
this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.33.2)



§ 153.0768  COMPLETENESS REVIEW FOR PLAT APPROVAL.



   The Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the applicant within ten days
whether the application is complete.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.33.3)



§ 153.0769  DECISION.



   (A)   Reviewing agency. The reviewing agency for preliminary plats
is the Planning Commission. All preliminary plats shall be processed through
a quasi-judicial procedure. Upon final approval, a preliminary plat shall be
made a matter of record as follows:



      (1)   The reasons for approval, disapproval or approval with
conditions shall be maintained on file with the Code Enforcement Officer; and



      (2)   The approved plat shall be indexed and filed by the Code
Enforcement Officer.



   (B)   Time limit for approval. The reviewing agency shall act on a
plat within 30 days after the date the plat is filed. Plats shall not be
deemed filed unless and until it is determined that complete information has
been provided, as set forth in subsection (C) below. A plat shall be approved
or disapproved within the 30-day period. Should there be no approval or
disapproval within 30 days the applicant shall notify the City Clerk/Finance
Director. The City Clerk/Finance Director shall notify the responsible party
or agency. The responsible party or agency shall then respond to the request
within 30 days. A plat is deemed approved unless the responsible party or
agency responds to the City Clerk/Finance Director’s request within 30 days.



   (C)   Withdrawal of application. Once filed with the reviewing
agency, a plat may be withdrawn, provided that a written notice of withdrawal
stating the reasons for the request is submitted to the Code Enforcement
Officer. The 30-day time limitation shall cease on the date that the notice
is received by the Code Enforcement Officer; however, the Code Enforcement
Officer may elect to present a withdrawal request to the Planning Commission
for consideration.

         (c)   The proposed development, including its lot sizes,
density, access and circulation, is compatible with the existing and/or
permissible future use of adjacent property.



         (d)   The proposed public facilities are adequate to
serve the normal and emergency demands of the proposed development, and to
provide for the efficient and timely extension to serve future development as
defined in Division 15 of this chapter.



         (e)   The proposed subdivision complies with Division 12
of this chapter; and the vehicular and pedestrian system is consistent with
adopted transportation plans, including the thoroughfare plans and the
collector street plan, and the street layout standards set forth in the
street design and transportation standards (§§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of
this chapter).



         (f)   The lot, block and street layout conform to the

safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision in a
manner consistent with the UDC.



   (B)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of a subdivision shall not
use a word that is the same as, similar to or pronounced the same as a word
in the name of any other subdivision in the city, except for the words
“court”, “addition”, “place”, “heights”, “hills” and
similar words, unless the land platted is contiguous to and platted by the
same applicant who platted the existing subdivision bearing the name, or the
applicant has obtained the written consent of the party who platted the
subdivision bearing that name, or the Code Enforcement Officer requires the
use of the same name for purposes of clear identification.



   (C)   Conditions on approvals. In considering an application for a
subdivision plat, the Planning Commission shall consider and may impose

§ 153.0772  AMENDMENTS.



   Amendments to a subdivision plat shall be approved in the same manner
as the original plat, except as otherwise provided for amending plats or
replats herein. Amendments to preliminary plats may be initiated by the owner
of property within the preliminary plat area subject to the following:



   (A)   Minor amendments may be approved by the Code Enforcement
Officer without filing a new preliminary plat. Minor amendments include the
following:



      (1)   Changes in the internal alignment of streets that do not
affect external properties or the connectivity index;



      (2)   Changes in internal parcel boundaries that do not abut
external property lines;



      (3)   Changes in setbacks along internal property lines;



      (4)   Changes in the routing of trails and pedestrian ways; or



      (5)   Changes in the orientation of buildings on internal
parcels.



   (B)   No minor change authorized by this section may cause any of
the following:



      (1)   Change in the permitted uses;



      (2)   Increased intensity of use as measured by the number of
dwelling units or square feet of non-residential building area;



      (3)   Increased trip generation or demand for public utilities;



      (4)   Decreased public or private open space area; or



      (5)   Increased volume or velocity of storm water runoff from
the development.

§ 153.0773  MAJOR AMENDMENTS.



   All other changes to an approved preliminary plat require the filing
and approval of a new preliminary plat.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.33.8)



§ 153.0774  SCOPE OF APPROVAL.



   (A)   The preliminary plat governs the preparation of the final
subdivision plat, which must be submitted for final approval and recordation
upon fulfillment of the requirements of this chapter.



   (B)   The approval is valid so long as the applicant receives and
maintains a valid subsequent development approval or initiates construction
within two years of the preliminary plat approval. If development has not
been initiated within two years of preliminary plat approval, any changes in
development standards shall apply to the development proposed by the
preliminary plat.



   (C)   If a final plat is not submitted within 12 months after
approval of the preliminary plat, or within such extended period as may be
allowed, the preliminary plat approval shall be void. The Planning Commission
may approve a staging plan extending the effective period of the preliminary
plat approval up to five years where it is the intent of the landowners to
proceed to final plats covering only a portion of the site at any one time.
Beyond two years or, in the case of staged development, five years, the
applicant shall resubmit a preliminary plat to the Code Enforcement Officer

modifications in design and/or specifications during construction, such
changes shall be made at the applicant’s own risk, but only with the
written approval of the Code Enforcement Officer. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to notify the Code Enforcement Officer in
advance of any changes to be made from the approved drawings. In the event
that actual construction work deviates from that shown on the approved
construction plans, and such deviation was not approved in advance by the
Code Enforcement Officer, the applicant may be required to correct the
installed improvements to conform to the approved construction plans. In

ensure conformity with the approved plans, specifications and standards.
Appropriate agencies of the state and the city may make inspections at any

regulations shall be inspected prior to acceptance by the city. Where
inspections are made by individuals or agencies, other than the Code
Enforcement Officer, the applicant shall provide the Code Enforcement Officer
with written reports of each final inspection.



   (B)   Inspection schedule. The applicant shall notify the Code
Enforcement Officer of the commencement of construction of improvements 24
hours prior thereto. Inspections are required at each of the following stages
of construction or as otherwise determined through an owner contract or
development improvement agreement:

construction contractor shall bear full and final responsibility for the
installation and construction of all required improvements according to the
provisions of these regulations and the standards and specifications of other
public agencies.



   (D)   Acceptance.



      (1)   Approval of the installation and construction of
improvements by the Code Enforcement Officer shall not constitute acceptance
by the city of the improvement for dedication purposes. The installation of
improvements in any subdivision shall in no case serve to bind the city to
accept such improvements for maintenance, repair or operation thereof. Such
acceptance shall be subject to the existing regulations concerning the
acceptance of each type of improvement.



      (2)   The city shall not have any responsibility with respect
to any street or other improvement, notwithstanding the use of same by the
public, unless the street or other improvements have been accepted.



      (3)   When improvements have been constructed in accordance
with the requirements and conditions of these regulations and the
specifications of this chapter, and the applicant has submitted as-built
reproducibles to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall accept the improvements for maintenance by the city; except that, this
shall not apply to improvements maintained by another entity.



      (4)   The provisions shall not relieve the subdivider or the
subdivider’s agent or contractor of any responsibility in notifying any
agency for the city of completed work and formal request for inspection of
same. The approving authorities having jurisdiction shall inspect and approve
all completed work prior to the release of any applied performance sureties.



   (E)   Site cleanup.



      (1)   The applicant shall be responsible for removal of all
equipment, material and general construction debris from the subdivision and
from any lot, street, public way or property therein or adjacent thereto.



      (2)   Dumping of such debris into sewers, onto adjacent
property or onto other land in the city is prohibited.



   (F)   Failure to complete improvements. If a subdivision improvement
agreement has been executed, and security has been posted and required public
improvements are not installed pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the
Code Enforcement Officer may:



      (1)   Declare the agreement to be in default and require that
all public improvements be installed regardless of the extent of completion
of the development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default;



      (2)   Obtain funds pursuant to the surety and complete the
public improvements by themselves or through a third party;



      (3)   Assign its right to receive funds pursuant to the surety
in whole or in part to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the
subdivision or addition for whom the public improvements were not
constructed, in exchange for the subsequent owner’s agreement to complete
the required public improvements; and/or



      (4)   Exercise any other rights available under the law.

SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS



§ 153.0830  APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer may waive the requirement for the
completion of required improvements if the applicant enters into a
subdivision improvement agreement by which the applicant covenants and agrees
to complete all required on- and off-site public improvements no later than
one year following the date upon which the final plat is recorded. Such
period may be extended for up to an additional six months upon its expiration
at the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer.



   (B)   The Code Enforcement Officer may require the applicant to
complete and dedicate some required public improvements prior to approval of
the final plat and to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement for
completion of the remainder of the required improvements during such one-year
period. The applicant shall bear the responsibility to prepare a subdivision
improvement agreement. The City Attorney shall approve any subdivision
improvement agreement as to form.

agreement shall be approved, and no performance guarantee shall be accepted,
until the base course for the streets within the applicable phase for which a
final plat is proposed has been installed.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.36.3)



§ 153.0833  PERFORMANCE SECURITY.



   Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer permits an applicant to enter
into a subdivision improvement agreement, the applicant shall be required to
provide sufficient security to ensure completion of the required public
improvements. The performance security shall be in an amount approved by the
City Manager as reflecting 125% of the cost of the improvements in the
approved construction plan, and shall be sufficient to cover all promises and
conditions contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. In addition to
all other security, when the city participates in the cost of an improvement,
the applicant shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the
city as a co-obligee. The issuer of any surety bond shall be subject to the
approval of the City Attorney.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.36.4)



§ 153.0834  TYPE OF SECURITY.



   (A)   Generally. The security shall be in the form of a performance
bond, a trust agreement, a letter of credit, cash escrow or a surety bond.

unaccepted improvements required by these regulations (other than gas and
electric lines), with the condition that the subdivider shall complete such
improvements and have them accepted by the city within three years from the
date of plat approval. The City Manager may sign the bond instrument on
behalf of the city and the City Attorney shall approve same as to form.



   (C)   Trust agreement. The subdivider shall cause to be placed in a
trust account on deposit in a bank or trust company or with a qualified
escrow agent selected by the subdivider and approved by the City Manager a
sum of money equal to the cost estimate, as approved by the City Manager, of
all uncompleted and unaccepted site improvements (other than gas and electric
lines) required by these regulations. The City Manager is authorized to sign
the agreement on behalf of the city and the City Attorney shall approve same
as to form.



   (D)   Letter of credit. The subdivider shall provide an irrevocable
letter of credit in an amount equal to the cost estimate, as approved by the
City Manager, of all uncompleted and unaccepted site improvements (other than
gas and electric lines) required by these regulations. The City Manager is
authorized to sign the agreement on behalf of the city and the City Attorney
shall approve same as to form.



   (E)   Cash or cashier’s check. The subdivider shall provide to the
city cash or a cashier’s check in an amount equal to the cost estimate as
approved by the City Manager of all uncompleted and unacceptable site

regulations. Upon completion of the required site improvements and their
acceptance by the City Manager, the amount will be refunded to the subdivider
by the city.



   (F)   Cash escrow or surety bond. If security is provided in the
form of a cash escrow, the applicant shall deposit with the Code Enforcement
Officer a cash amount or certified check endorsed to the escrow agent for a
face value in an amount of at least the amount specified by the City Manager.
A surety bond or cash escrow account shall accrue to the city for
administering the construction, operation and maintenance of the improvements.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.36.5)



§ 153.0835  GUARANTEES.



   When a subdivider has given security in any of the forms provided in §
153.0834 of this chapter, and when 50% of the required site improvements has
been completed and accepted by the City Manager, or whenever any segment or
segments of the required site improvements have been completed and accepted
by the City Manager, the subdivider may substitute for the original guarantee
a new guarantee in an amount equal to the cost of the remaining site
improvements. The cost estimate shall be approved by the City Manager. Such
new guarantee need not be in the same form as the original guarantee so long
as such guarantee is one that is listed in § 153.0834 of this chapter.
However, in no event shall the substitution of one security for another in
any way change or modify the terms and conditions of the performance
agreement or the obligation of the subdivider as specified in the performance
agreement.

   (A)   (1)   The applicant shall guarantee the improvements
against defects in workmanship and materials for a period of five years from
the date of acceptance of such improvements. In exceptional situations, where
undue hardship would otherwise result and the shorter term would be
consistent with the purposes of the UDC, the Code Enforcement Officer may
recommend and the Planning Commission may approve a shorter-term maintenance
guarantee.



      (2)   The maintenance guarantee shall be secured by a surety
bond or cash escrow in an amount reflecting 50% of the cost of the completed
improvements.



   (B)   If the applicant has entered into a subdivision improvement
agreement for the completion of required improvements, an appropriate
percentage of the performance bond or cash escrow may be retained by the city
in lieu of a maintenance bond.



   (C)   If the applicant has not entered into a subdivision
improvement agreement, the applicant shall guarantee the improvements as
required by this section. A surety bond or cash escrow totaling 50% of the

SUBDIVISION VARIANCES



§ 153.0850  APPLICABILITY.



   The city hereby finds and determines that some standards of the UDC may
be impracticable in some situations due to exceptional circumstances, such as
difficult terrain and unique topographical conditions. The city finds and
determines that the granting of such exceptions is in the public interest,
but that administrative review is needed in order to ensure that the spirit
and intent of the UDC is preserved. Accordingly, these procedures permit
administrative exceptions to be granted as part of the subdivision plat
approval process without the need for a variance. Applicants who are denied

any of the requirements of this chapter, to the extent necessary to comply
with or conform to federal or state law, or to avoid or resolve any alleged

this provision and that the peculiar conditions and circumstances are not the
result of the actions of the applicant.

not the result of the actions of the applicant.



      (4)   The reasons set forth in the application justify the

approval process by the city and through corresponding assurances by
developers.



   (B)   This section:

process, which results in a waste of resources that contributes to escalating
costs of development and which, in turn, discourages investment and produces
higher prices for consumers;



      (2)   Assures applicants that, upon approval of their project,
they may proceed in accordance with existing policies, rules and regulations;



      (3)   Encourages the achievement of growth management goals
and objectives, including assurances of adequate public facilities at the
time of development, proper timing and sequencing of development, effective
capital improvements programming and appropriate development incentives in

§ 153.0958  COORDINATION OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT APPLICATION WITH OTHER
DISCRETIONARY APPROVALS.



   It is the intent of these regulations that the application for a
development agreement will be made and be considered simultaneously with the
review of other necessary applications, including, but not limited to:
rezoning; subdivision and plat approval; planned commercial, residential or
industrial development; and CUPs. If combined with an application for
rezoning, subdivision, plat approval, planned development or CUP, the
application for a development agreement shall be submitted with said
application and shall be processed, to the maximum extent possible, jointly
to avoid duplication of hearings and repetition of information. A development
agreement is not a substitute for, nor an alternative to, any other required
development approval and the applicant must comply with all other required
procedures for development approval.

ORDINANCES, LAWS AND POLICIES.



   (A)   Unless otherwise provided by the development agreement, rules,
regulations, ordinances, laws, general or specific plans, and official
policies of the city governing permitted uses, development, density and
intensity of use, permitted uses of the land, growth management, adequacy of
public facilities, environmental considerations and governing design,
improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to the
subject property shall be those in force and effect at the time of
commencement of the term of the development agreement.



   (B)   (1)   The adoption of a development agreement, however,
shall not prevent the city, in subsequent actions applicable to the property
or to the city in general, from applying such newer, modified rules,
regulations, ordinances, laws, general or specific plans and official
policies that do not conflict with those applicable to the property at the
time of commencement of the development agreement and that do not prevent the
development of the land as set forth in the development agreement.



      (2)   The existence of the development agreement shall not
prevent the city from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent
project development application not expressly addressed in said agreement on
the basis of such existing or new rules, regulations and policies.



   (C)   Application, processing and inspection fees, development fees,
improvement standards as set forth in the city subdivision regulations and
construction standards, and specifications that are revised during the term
of a development agreement shall apply to the property; provided that:



      (1)   Such fees, standards and specifications apply to public
works within the city; and



      (2)   Their application to the subject property is prospective
only as to applications for building and other development approvals or
approvals of tentative subdivision maps not yet accepted for processing.

§ 153.0960  SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.



   In the event that state or federal laws or regulations are enacted
following approval of a development agreement that prevent or preclude
compliance with one or more provisions of the development agreement, the
provisions of the agreement shall be modified or suspended as may be
necessary to comply with such state or federal laws or regulations, and every
such development agreement shall so provide.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.55.10)



§ 153.0961  PERIODIC REVIEW, TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION.



   An adopted development agreement shall be reviewed at least every 24
months, at which time the owner or owners of the property subject to the
development agreement shall be required to demonstrate good faith compliance
with the terms of the development agreement. If, as a result of such review,
the city finds and determines, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the
owner or owners have not complied in good faith with the conditions of the
development agreement, the city may unilaterally terminate or modify the
agreement. Such action shall be taken by the city at a regular or special
meeting, provided that the developer is notified at least ten days in advance
of such meeting.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.55.11)



§ 153.0962  AMENDMENT OR CANCELLATION OF AGREEMENT.



   A development agreement may be amended or canceled, in whole or in
part, by mutual consent of the parties to the development agreement or their
successors in interest. The procedure for amendment or cancellation shall be
the same as that for adoption as provided in § 153.0959 of this chapter.
Notice of intent to amend or cancel any portion of the development agreement
shall be given in the manner provided in §§ 153.0530 through 153.0533 of
this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.55.12)



§ 153.0963  ANNEXATION.



   If a development agreement relates to property located outside the
incorporated area of the city, the development agreement does not become
operative unless annexation proceedings to annex the property to the city are
completed within the period of time specified by the development agreement or
any extension of such time. Any development agreement relating to such
property shall specify a time period within which such property shall be
annexed to the city.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 4.55.13)



§ 153.0964  ENFORCEMENT.



   A development agreement shall be enforceable by any party to the
agreement, even if there is a change in any applicable rule, regulation,
ordinance, law, plan or official policy of the city that alters or amends the
rules, regulations, ordinances, laws, plans or official policies specified in
the agreement as provided in § 153.0954 of this chapter, or in the
development agreement itself, except insofar as new plans or regulations are
made applicable to the development by the terms of this chapter or by
provisions of the development agreement. The remedies specified herein and in
the development agreement are not exclusive, and any party to the agreement
may pursue any other available remedies at law or in equity.

§ 153.0980  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.



   (A)   Generally. All improvements required by this chapter shall be
operated and maintained as required by this section. The instruments creating
the dedication, homeowners’ association (HOA), condominium association,
easement, transfer or improvement district shall be attached to the
application for subdivision plat approval.



   (B)   Dedication of land. Dedication of the improvement to the city
satisfies the requirements of this section. Dedication shall take the form of

      (1)   Such land is accessible to the residents of the city;



      (2)   There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs
incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance; and

   (C)   Homeowners’ association.



      (1)   Improvements that are owned in common by all owners of
lots or units in the subdivision or condominium are required by this chapter
to be operated and maintained by an HOA established in the covenants,
conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) adopted as a condition of development
approval. The CC&Rs shall provide that, in the event that the association
fails to maintain the improvements according to the standards of this
chapter, the city may, following reasonable notice and demand that deficiency
of operation or maintenance be corrected, enter the land area to repair,
operate or maintain the improvement. The cost of such maintenance shall be
the responsibility of the HOA, which shall be required by the CC&Rs to levy
an assessment to be charged to all owners.



      (2)   The HOA shall be formed and operated under the following
provisions.



         (a)   The developer shall provide a description of the
HOA, including its bylaws and methods for operating and maintaining the
improvement.



         (b)   The HOA shall be organized by the developer, and
shall be operated with a financial subsidy from the developer, before the
sale of any lots or units within the development or condominium.

purchasers of homes and their successors. The conditions and timing of
transferring control of the HOA from developer to homeowners shall be
identified.



         (d)   The HOA shall be responsible for maintenance of
insurance and taxes on undivided improvement, enforceable by liens placed by
the city on the HOA. The HOA shall be authorized under its bylaws to place
liens on the property of residents who fall delinquent in payment of such
dues or assessments. Such liens may require the imposition of penalty
interest charges. Should any bill or bills for maintenance of undivided
improvement by the city be unpaid by November 1 of each year, a late fee of
15% shall be added to such bills and a lien shall be filed against the
premises in the same manner as other municipal claims.



         (e)   A proposed operations budget and plan for
long-term capital repair and replacement of the improvement shall be
submitted with the final plat. The members of the HOA shall share the costs
of maintaining and developing such undivided improvement. Shares shall be
defined within the HOA bylaws. The operations and budget plan shall provide
for construction of any improvements relating to the improvement within three
years following recordation of the plat.



         (f)   In the event of a proposed transfer, within the
methods here permitted, of undivided improvement land by the HOA, notice of
such action shall be given to all property owners within the development.



         (g)   The HOA shall have or hire staff to administer
common facilities and properly and continually maintain the undivided
improvement.



         (h)   The HOA may lease improvement lands to any other
qualified person, or corporation, for operation and maintenance of park
and/or open space lands, but such a lease agreement shall provide that:



            1.   The residents of the development shall at all
times have access to the reserved park and/or open space lands;



            2.   The undivided improvement to be leased shall
be maintained for the purposes set forth in this chapter; and



            3.   The operation of improvement facilities may
be for the benefit of the residents only, or may be open to the residents of
the city, at the election of the developer and/or HOA, as the case may be.
The lease shall be subject to the approval of the board, and any transfer or
assignment of the lease shall be further subject to the approval of the
board. Lease agreements so entered upon shall be recorded with the Register
of Deeds within 30 days of their execution and a copy of the recorded lease
shall be filed with the city.



         (i)   Failure to adequately maintain undivided
improvements in reasonable order and condition constitutes a violation of
this chapter. The city is authorized to give notice, by personal service or
by U.S. mail or private delivery service, to the owner or occupant, as the
case may be, of any violation, directly to the owner to remedy same within 30
days.



   (D)   Condominiums. The undivided improvement and associated
facilities may be controlled through the use of permanent condominium
agreements, approved by the city. All undivided improvement land shall be
held as a common element. A proposed operations budget and plan for long-term
capital repair and replacement shall be submitted with the application.



   (E)   Dedication of easements. The city may, but is not required to,
accept easements for public use of any portion or portions of undivided
improvement land, the title of which is to remain in ownership by the
condominium or HOA; provided that:



      (1)   Such land is accessible to city residents;



      (2)   There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs
incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance; and



      (3)   A satisfactory maintenance agreement is reached between
the developer, the condominium, the HOA and the city. Land dedicated as a
natural area, greenway or greenbelt (§§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of this
chapter) shall be subject to a duly executed conservation easement meeting
the requirements of and enforceable in accordance with state statute, which
easement shall be unlimited in duration.



   (F)   Transfer of easements. For parks and open space only, an owner
may transfer perpetual easements to a private, non-profit organization, among
whose purposes it is to conserve improvement and/or natural resources (such
as a land conservancy); provided that:



      (1)   The organization is a bona fide conservation
organization with perpetual existence;



      (2)   The organization is financially capable of maintaining

DESIGN STANDARDS



§ 153.0995  GENERALLY.



   This division provides for lots, blocks, buildings and structures that
provide a pedestrian scale, offer alternative paths for vehicular traffic,
and accommodate on-street parking. Standards are provided to ensure that lots
have adequate access and conform to the zoning provisions of the UDC. The
city finds and determines that long blocks lined with homes and other
buildings reduce street connectivity and impair the efficiency of public and
safety services while increasing distances between residences and non-
residential destinations or public gathering places. Exceptions to these
standards are made for non-urban districts and zoning districts that require
greater flexibility in order to encourage environmental protection or
economic development.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013)



§ 153.0996  LOTS.



   (A)   Buildings to be on a lot. Except as permitted in the “PD”
(Planned Development) District, every building shall be located on a lot. In
the neighborhood zoning districts, no more than one principal building is
permitted on a lot unless otherwise provided in the applicable zoning
district regulations.



   (B)   Compliance with zoning district regulations. The size, width,
depth, shape and orientation of lots shall comply with the applicable zoning
district regulations.



   (C)   Frontage. All lots shall front on a public or private street
and shall have a minimum frontage width as indicated in the zoning district
regulations. On irregularly shaped lots, a minimum street frontage of 15 feet
is required. An “irregularly shaped lot” includes any lot located on a
cul- de-sac or abutting a curved section of a roadway with a centerline
radius of less than 200 feet.



   (D)   Front and side setbacks.



      (1)   Designation. Front and side setbacks adjacent to streets
shall be shown on all plats as required by Divisions 3 and 4 of this chapter.
A subdivider may elect to impose greater setbacks through restrictive
covenants. The city shall only enforce the setbacks required by Divisions 3
and 4 of this chapter.



      (2)   Side yard building line. The building line for an
existing residence having a side yard of three or more feet may be maintained
on any addition to the residence, but in no instance shall the side yard be
less than three feet.



      (3)   Yards adjacent to rights-of-way and easements. On lots
that abut a public alley, railroad right-of-way or a utility/drainage
right-of-way or easement that is not part of a platted lot, one-half of such
alley, right-of-way or easement, up to a maximum of 15 feet, may be
considered as part of the minimum required rear or side yard.



      (4)   Variation in front yard. In any block in which 70% of
the lots have front yards that are less than required by the existing zoning
regulations, construction on any remaining vacant lots is permitted to the
average yard of the existing improved lots.



      (5)   Rear yards on irregular lots.



         (a)   For lots fronting on cul-de-sacs, eyebrows or
elbows, and other irregularly shaped lots, a rear yard of 15 feet is
permitted based on the mean horizontal distance of the principal structure
from the rear lot line; provided that, no part of the structure is closer
than ten feet to the lot line.



         (b)   The mean horizontal distance shall be calculated
by adding the products of the width of each segment of the principal
structure multiplied by its average distance from the property line and then
dividing this sum by the total width of the structure.



      (6)   Dwelling on small lot. A platted lot within a
residential district that contains less than the minimum area for the
district may be used for a single-family dwelling, provided that the lot is
held in separate and different ownership from any immediately abutting lot,
has a minimum area of 3,500 square feet, and has a minimum street frontage of
20 feet.



   (E)   Corner lots.



      (1)   Corner lots shall have two front setbacks and two side
setbacks.



      (2)   For corner lots, the side having the shortest street
frontage is considered the front for setback purposes. The Code Enforcement
Officer may waive this requirement and determine the front yard to be on the
street front that is in line with the prevailing pattern of front yards on
the street in order to be consistent with the established pattern of the
street.



   (F)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage or through lots are
prohibited, except in commercial or industrial districts.



   (G)   Setback encroachments. The features designated in Table
153.0996(A) below may encroach into a required yard as indicated in the
table. The accessory structures shown in Table 153.0996(A) below are
permitted in the locations indicated.



   (H)   Vehicle and pedestrian areas for single-family, duplex,
triplex and quadraplex lots.



      (1)   Generally. Restrictions on driveway areas are designed
to avoid the domination of front yards by large expanses of impervious
surfaces, which deaden the streetscape and discourage pedestrian activity.
Reducing the width of driveways can reduce total site imperviousness.



      (2)   Applicability. This section applies to any subdivision
plat, site plan or development approval authorizing a single-family, duplex,
triplex or quadraplex structure.

NOTES TO TABLE:

A dash (“-”) means that no restriction applies. Where a setback and a
setback encroachment is indicated, the stricter standard applies.




 



      (3)   Alleys. If the site is served by an alley, access for
motor vehicles must be from the alley and not from a street frontage.



      (4)   Location. Parking areas may not be located in the front
setback. Parking may be provided in the rear yard, and access may be provided
through alleys where the front yard is insufficient to accommodate a driveway.



      (5)   Vehicle areas between the porch and the street. Vehicle
areas may not be located between the building’s porch or porches and an
adjacent street.



      (6)   Walkways. A walkway shall extend from the sidewalk or
street to the main entrance. The walkway shall be at least two feet, but not
more than five feet in width.



      (7)   Driveways.



         (a)   1.   Driveways and other impervious surfaces
shall not comprise more than the percentage of the front yard as specified in
Column (B) of Table 153.0996(B) below for the zoning districts or use
patterns designated in Column (A) of the same table.



            2.   Driveways shall not exceed the width
established in Column (C) of Table 153.0996(B) below.



            3.   Parking may be provided in the rear yard, and
access may be provided through alleys where the front yard is insufficient to
accommodate a driveway.



            4.   Table 153.0996(B) below does not apply to
irregularly shaped lots as defined by §§ 153.1105 through 153.1110 of this
chapter.



         (b)   In order to reduce run-off and increase storm
water travel times, alternative materials for driveway surfaces, such as
pervious pavers or gravel, is permitted in any residential zoning district.



   (I)   Flag lots.



      (1)   No more than the number of flag lots shown in Table
153.0996(C) below may be authorized, allowing for the more efficient use of
irregularly shaped parcels of land, sites with physical limitations, or where
the integrated nature of multiple buildings on a site dictates the need for
such lots. Flag lots are not permitted where they will increase the number of
lots accessing collector or arterial streets.



      (2)   The minimum driveway width for a flag lot is nine feet.



      (3)   (a)   The minimum frontage at the right-of-way line
for any flag lot shall be equal to the minimum required driveway width, plus
four feet.



         (b)   The flagpole portion of the lot shall not be
considered in determining the area of the lot.

   (J)   Reduction of lot size by governmental action. Where the owner
of a legally platted lot or successor in title has a lot reduced in size as a
result of governmental action, and does not own sufficient land to enable the
lot to conform to the dimensional requirements of this chapter, such lot may
be used as a building site for a single-family residence or other
non-residential use permitted in the district in which the lot is located;
provided that:



      (1)   Where the lot area or mean lot width is reduced by
governmental action by less than 20% of the minimum specified in this
chapter, the Code Official shall issue a development approval or certificate
of occupancy; and



      (2)   In those cases where the lot area or mean lot width is
reduced by governmental action by more than 20%, the Code Enforcement Officer
may approve as a building site a dimension that conforms as closely as
possible to the required dimensions of this chapter; provided that, the
combined area of the principal building and accessory buildings shall not
cover more than 40% of the lot area remaining after governmental action.

   (A)   Lots to be contiguous. Lots shall be arranged in a contiguous
pattern within blocks or abutting a cul-de-sac. For minor subdivisions, all
lots shall be contiguous and any new lots subdivided from a tract that has
been previously subdivided shall adjoin the existing lots.



   (B)   Block width. Blocks to the interior of the subdivision shall
have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots. One tier of required
block width is permitted in blocks adjacent to collector or arterial streets
or waterways. Not more than two tiers of lots shall be provided for any
block. This section does not apply to flag lots (Figure 153.0996(A) of this

§ 153.0999  BUILDING DESIGN.



   (A)   Purpose and findings.



      (1)   The purpose of these regulations is to provide specific
criteria so that new buildings blend into the historic architectural
framework of the city.



      (2)   These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing design principles,
which can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory
visual appearance within the city; preserve taxable values; and promote the
public health, safety and general welfare.



      (3)   These standards:



         (a)   Provide a physical and visual connection between
the living area of the residence and the street;



         (b)   Enhance public safety by allowing people to survey
their neighborhood from inside their residences, places of work or shopping
areas;



         (c)   Provide a more pleasant pedestrian environment by
preventing large expanses of blank facades along streets;



         (d)   Ensure that the location and amount of the living
area of the residence, as seen from the street, is more prominent than the
garage;



         (e)   Prevent garages from obscuring the main entrance
from the street and ensure that the main entrance for pedestrians, rather
than automobiles, is the prominent entrance;



         (f)   Provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment
by preventing garages and vehicle areas from dominating the views of the
neighborhood from the sidewalk;



         (g)   Enhance public safety by preventing garages from
blocking views of the street from inside the residence;



         (h)   Supplement the zoning regulations applied to
site-built, modular and manufactured homes, with additional standards and
procedures that will promote a satisfactory living environment for residents
of single-family homes and that will permit a mix of homes and other types of
housing within the city;



         (i)   Permit greater diversity in the types of housing
communities;



         (j)   Ensure that all new single-family dwellings are
compatible with other forms of housing; and



         (k)   Ensure the provision of single-family housing
opportunities for persons or families of low or moderate income by providing
for design standards that ensure compatibility among various types of housing
units as an alternative to exclusionary zoning.



   (B)   Single-family residential dwellings.



      (1)   Applicability.



         (a)   Types of dwelling units. Unless otherwise
specified in this chapter, this section applies to:



            1.   Any single-family dwelling unit;



            2.   Any duplex; and



            3.   Any triplex.



         (b)   Design elements required. The combination of
design elements, as shown in Table 153.0999(A) below, is required for any
dwelling unit subject to this section.

      (2)   Size limitations. No single-family dwelling unit,
duplex, or triplex shall exceed 8,000 square feet in size, nor exceed a floor
area ratio (FAR) of 0.60. The total area of all dwellings and accessory
structures shall not exceed a FAR of 0.75.



      (3)   Main entrance.



         (a)   Location of main entrance. The main entrance of
each primary structure must face the street. On corner lots, the main
entrance may face either of the streets or be oriented to the corner. With
buildings that have more than one main entrance, only one entrance must meet
this requirement. A building must include a front porch or stoop at all main
entrances that face a street. The porch or stoop shall adjoin the main
entrance and the main entrance shall be accessible from the porch.



         (b)   Porches.



            1.   Porches shall be covered by a solid roof. The
roof shall not be located more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch. If
the roof of a required porch is developed as a deck or balcony, it may be
flat.



            2.   The porch shall have minimum dimensions of
six feet by six feet. For single-family dwellings, the covered area provided
by the porch must be at least 48 square feet and a minimum of eight feet
wide. If the main entrance is for more than one dwelling unit, the covered
area provided by the porch must be at least 63 square feet and a minimum of
nine feet wide.



         (c)   Covered balconies. The covered area provided by
the balcony must be at least 48 square feet, a minimum of eight feet wide and
no more than 15 feet above grade. The covered balcony must be accessible from
the interior living space of the house.



         (d)   Openings between porch floor and ground. Openings
of more than one foot between the porch floor and the ground must be covered
with a solid material or lattice.



      (4)   Garages.



         (a)   Generally. Garages shall either be detached or
shall be facing the side or rear lot line. A garage wall may not be closer to
the street lot line than the front of the porch.



         (b)   Detached garages. These standards encourage
detached garages as an alternative to front-loaded attached garages.

district. Detached garages shall be located in the rear or side yard. The
footprint for the garage structure shall not exceed 26 by 30 feet or 780
square feet. The garage walls, measured from the eave to the adjacent grade,
shall not exceed 15 feet in height or the height of the principal structure,
whichever is less.



            2.   A detached garage that is non-conforming due
to its location in a setback may be rebuilt on its existing foundation if it
was originally constructed legally. An addition may be made to these types of
garages if the addition complies with the standards of this section, or if
the combined size of the existing foundation and any additions are no larger
than 12 feet wide by 18 feet deep. The garage walls shall not exceed ten feet
in height.



         (c)   Street-facing garage walls.



            1.   Applicability. This section applies to
garages that are accessory to single-family dwelling units, manufactured
homes, duplexes or triplexes. Where a proposal is for an alteration or
addition to existing development, the standard applies only to the portion
being altered or added. Garages that are accessory to attached houses,
development on flag lots or development on lots that slope up or down from
the street with an average slope of 20% or more, are exempt from this
standard.



            2.   Maximum length and size. The length of that
portion of a garage wall facing the street shall not exceed 50% of the length
of the street-facing building facade. Garage doors may not exceed 80 square
feet in area. There may be no more than two individual garage doors per side.
On corner lots, only one street-facing garage wall must meet this standard.
Where the street-facing facade of the building is less than 24 feet long, the

feet deep and accessible from the interior living area of the dwelling unit.



         (d)   Street lot line setbacks. A garage wall that faces
a street shall be located at least 20 feet behind the plane of the front
facade. A street-facing garage wall may adjoin the front facade or be located
within the area described above, where:



            1.   The street-facing garage wall does not exceed
30% of the length of the building facade; and



            2.   The interior living area is located above the
garage. The living area must be set back no more than four feet from the
street-facing garage wall, or shall include a covered balcony above the
garage that is at least the same length as the street-facing garage wall, at
least six feet deep, and accessible from the interior living area of the
dwelling unit.



         (e)   Street-facing garage walls prohibited in “D”
(Downtown) District or traditional neighborhood development (TND). Garage
walls facing the street or extending beyond the front elevation of a dwelling

The Code Enforcement Officer may waive up to 50% of the open space
requirement if all units within the development are located within 1,000 feet
of a public park as measured along a public sidewalk. The open space
requirements of this section shall not apply to multi-family residential
developments that are second-floor units above first-floor commercial
development, or to any residential developments in the “D” (Downtown)
Zoning District that are above the first floor. Open space provided pursuant
to this requirement shall be accessible to all residents of the development
and shall measure at least 30 feet across its narrowest dimension.



      (4)   Pedestrian facilities. Sidewalks shall be constructed
within the interior of the development to link residential buildings with
other destinations, such as, but not limited to, parking, adjoining streets,
mailboxes, trash disposal, adjoining sidewalks or greenways and on-site
amenities, such as recreation areas. These interior sidewalks shall be
constructed in accordance with the standards for sidewalks in §§ 153.1065
through 153.1078 of this chapter. Sidewalks shall be provided adjacent to all
public streets that provide access to the development.



      (5)   Building design. Building design for multi-family
buildings shall:



         (a)   Provide interesting and aesthetically attractive
multi-family developments;



         (b)   Avoid monotonous, “barracks”-style buildings;



         (c)   Ensure that multi-family buildings have a
multi-faceted exterior form in which articulated facades are combined with
window and door placements as well as other detailing; and



         (d)   Create an interesting and attractive architectural
design. These standards limit flat walls with minimal features.

         (j)   Provide economic development opportunities through
clean industry, office and commercial uses; and



         (k)   Provide for the daily needs and services of the
community. These standards are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety. See Figure 153.0999(A) below for orientation of
commercial design elements.







Figure 153.0999(A): Commercial Design Elements



      (2)   Applicability. Unless otherwise specified in this
chapter, this section applies to any commercial building or structure.



      (3)   Floor area. In order to implement the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan related to the impacts of large-scale
development upon neighborhoods, the need for walk-ability and viable
mixed-use communities to enhance the air quality, reduce traffic congestion,
promote safety from traffic accidents, and enhance the land-use plans of the
downtown and commercial corridors or centers, no commercial building or
structure used for retail shall have a gross floor area (GFA) of 40,000
square feet or greater, or store or display lumber, or building materials
outside of a completely enclosed building, except where located in a corridor
commercial overlay zoning district, or downtown commercial district, where
the GFA ratio may not exceed 60,000 gross square feet per building or
structure and outside storage or display shall be subject to a special use
permit. Every commercial building used for retail or wholesale sales that
exceeds 25,000 square feet shall obtain a special use permit prior to
obtaining any development approval under the UDC. The special use permit
shall require a written finding by the Board of Appeals that:



         (a)   The building intensity and use is consistent with
the applicable comprehensive, area or neighborhood plan goals, objectives,
policies and strategies;



         (b)   The building contains mixed uses of commercial,
office and residential;



         (c)   The building meets all of the other standards of
the UDC, and particularly that of Division 2 of this chapter; and



         (d)   The building will not create excessive on-or
off-site traffic, environmental, aesthetic, storm drainage, fiscal or
non-compatibility impacts upon adjoining properties and neighborhoods. The
applicant for the special use permit shall provide to the Board of Appeals or
legislative body a traffic fiscal impact report and an environmental impact
assessment, along with the application for the special use permit. This
documentation shall provide substantial competent evidence to support the
findings in subsections (F)(3)(a) through (d) above.



      (4)   Building structure.



         (a)   Base, middle and cap. Buildings exceeding two
stories shall incorporate a base, a middle and a cap described as follows:



            1.   The base shall include an entryway with
transparent windows as set forth in the ground-floor design standards
(division (F)(6) below), and a molding or reveal placed between the first and
second stories or over the second story. The molding or reveal shall have a
depth of at least two inches and a height of at least four inches;



            2.   The middle may include windows and/or
balconies; and



            3.   The cap shall include the area from the top
floor to the roof of the building, and shall include a cornice or a roof
overhang.



         (b)   Alignment. Windowsills, moldings, and cornices
shall align with those of adjacent buildings. The bottom and top line
defining the edge of the windows (the “windowsill alignment”) shall vary
not more than two feet from the alignment of surrounding buildings. If the
adjoining buildings have a windowsill alignment that varies by more than two
feet from one another, the proposed building shall align with one of the
adjoining buildings.



      (5)   Facade size.



         (a)   FACADE SIZE refers to the length multiplied by the
width of any facade that faces or is parallel to a public or private street.
FACADE means the exterior side of a building and includes the entire building
walls, including wall faces, parapets, fascia, windows, doors, canopy and
visible roof structures of one complete elevation. The sum total of the
facade areas on a lot may exceed the maximum facade size described in this
section by dividing the buildings into two or more buildings, or into
distinct “modules” that incorporate visible changes in the facade
elevation through the use of wall plane projections, piers, columns,
colonnades, arcades or similar architectural features that create a distinct
facade elevation (see Figure 153.0999(A) above).



         (b)   Each module shall have separate windows and
entryways. The modules for a single, continuous facade shall not exceed an
average of 30 feet in width. No module shall exceed 50 feet in width. (See
Figure 153.0999(B) below.)







Figure 153.0999(B): Form-Based Zoning



Modules are useful in developing form-based zoning.



      (6)   Ground-floor design.



         (a)   All buildings subject to this section shall have
their principal entrance opening to a street, square, plaza or sidewalk. The
principal entrance shall not open onto a parking lot. Pedestrian access from
the public sidewalk, street right-of-way or driveway to the principal
structure shall be provided through an improved surface.



         (b)   The ground floor of the entryway shall align with
the sidewalk elevation. Sunken terraces or stairways to a basement shall not
constitute entryways for purposes of this section. It is not the intent of
this section to preclude the use of below-grade entryways; provided, however,
that, such entryways shall not constitute a principal entryway and shall not
be used to satisfy the distancing requirements of subsection (F)(8) below.



      (7)   Street wall. Where a maximum front setback has been
established, the front building wall or courtyard shall adjoin the sidewalk.
The side setback shall be a minimum of zero feet and a maximum of ten feet.



      (8)   Windows and entryways.



         (a)   Windows above the ground floor shall have a
minimum ratio of height to width of 2:1.



         (b)   The ground floors of all buildings shall be
designed to encourage and to complement pedestrian-scale activity by the use
of windows and doors arranged so that the uses are visible from and/or
accessible to the street on at least 50% of the length of the first-floor
street frontage. At least 60%, nor more than 90%, of the total surface area
of the front elevation shall be in public entrances and windows (including
retail display windows). Where windows are used, they shall be transparent.



         (c)   Solid walls shall not exceed 20 feet in length.



         (d)   All street-level retail uses with sidewalk
frontage shall be furnished with an individual entrance and direct access to
the sidewalk in addition to any other access that may be provided. This
standard shall not apply to any lot with a street frontage of less than 24
feet.



         (e)   Doors shall be recessed into the face of the
building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape.
An entryway shall not be less than one square foot for each 1,000 square feet
of floor area, and in all cases shall not be less than 15 square feet.



         (f)   The maximum setback requirements may be waived by
the Code Enforcement Officer for an area not to exceed 90% of the frontage in
order to accommodate courtyards.



         (g)   Canopies, awnings, and similar appurtenances may
be constructed at the entrance to any building, subject to the criteria
established in the currently adopted International Building Code.



      (9)   Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment, electrical
meter and service components, and similar utility devices, whether ground
level, wall mounted or roof mounted, shall be screened from view at the front
property line. Exterior screening materials shall be the same as the
predominant exterior materials of the principal building. In cases where the
front property line is higher than the roof line of the subject building, no
screening shall be required for a line of sight exceeding five feet six
inches above the finished elevation of the property at the front property
line.



   (G)   Civic buildings. Civic buildings shall include columns,
arcades or colonnades in lieu of the ground-level design requirements of this
section.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.13; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.1000  FENCES AND WALLS.



   (A)   Design.



      (1)   Articulation. No fence or wall, or portion, shall exceed
100 horizontal feet in length unless one of the following architectural
features visible from the paved surface of the street is provided as part of
the fence:



         (a)   A column or pillar; or



         (b)   Articulation of the surface plane wall by
incorporating plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least one
foot and extending a horizontal distance of at least three feet and less than
20 feet.



      (2)   Exception. Subsection (A)(1) above does not apply to a
fence or wall constructed of brick, masonry or iron fencing that consists of
at least 50% open voids. The square footage of the fence shall be measured by
taking the total square footage of an area defined by the length of the fence
and its average height. The percent of open voids shall then be derived by
dividing the total square footage of the open voids by the total square
footage of the area calculated above and multiplying this figure by 100. The
fence’s framing (the vertical posts supporting the fence from the ground
and no more than three horizontal cross bars between the posts or brick or
stone pillars) shall not be included in the calculation of the total square
footage; provided that, the framing posts and cross bars do not exceed a
four-inch width and the posts are spaced at least eight feet apart.



   (B)   Height.



      (1)   Front yard. No fence or wall, other than the wall of a
permitted structure, shall exceed a height of four feet in the front yard. No
fence or wall shall obscure vision above a height of four feet.



      (2)   Side or rear yard.



         (a)   No fence or wall, other than the wall of a
permitted structure, shall be erected or altered in any side or rear yard to
exceed a height of six feet.



         (b)   The following exceptions apply to subsection
(B)(2)(a) above:



            1.   Subsection (B)(2)(a) above does not apply
where the supplemental use regulations in Division 16 of this chapter require
a higher fence for screening or security purposes;



            2.   A fence may be erected or altered up to a
height of eight feet where the fence abuts a collector or higher-order
street, the ground-floor elevation of the principal dwelling on an abutting
lot is at least four feet higher than the elevation at the abutting lot line
(Figure 153.1000(A) below), the fence abuts a side or rear lot line that
abuts a collector street or an arterial street (in which case streetscape
planting shall be provided in accordance with §§ 153.1145 and 153.1146 of
this chapter), or the fence is a sound wall or fence required by the State
Department of Transportation. The additional fence height may be permitted by
the city pursuant to a rezoning or conditional use permit (CUP).



      (3)   Industrial districts. Fence height restrictions do not
apply in the “IL” (Industrial Light) or “IH” (Industrial Heavy)
Districts where:



         (a)   The lot does not abut a residential or commercial
district; and



         (b)   The fence height and location do not adversely
affect site distance at street and/or alley intersections.



   (C)   Residential subdivisions. The city finds that it is necessary
for the public welfare to impose standards to improve and preserve the
quality of fences in residential neighborhoods in order to avoid blighting
influences on neighborhoods and public safety problems.



      (1)   Applicability. This section applies to fences located
along the perimeter of a tract or parcel subject to an application for
subdivision approval and abutting a collector or arterial street.



      (2)   Standards.



         (a)   A fence may be constructed of permanent material,
such as wood, chain link, stone, rock, concrete block, masonry brick, brick,
decorative wrought iron or other materials that are similar in durability.



         (b)   The following materials shall not be used for
fencing subject to this section:







Figure 153.1000(A): Fence Height

§ 153.1001  LIGHTING.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. These provisions are intended to control
the use of outdoor, artificial illuminating devices emitting rays into the
night sky that have a detrimental effect on the rural atmosphere and
astronomical observations and that create glare. It is the intention of this
section to:



      (1)   Encourage good lighting practices such that lighting
systems are designed to conserve energy and money;



      (2)   Minimize glare;



      (3)   Protect the use and enjoyment of surrounding property;
and



      (4)   Increase nighttime safety, utility, security and
productivity.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   Generally.



         (a)   All outdoor, artificial illuminating devices shall
be installed in conformance with the provisions of this section and the
Building Code of the city.



         (b)   This section does not prevent the use of any
material or method of installation not specifically addressed. In considering
any variance from the provisions of this section, the Board of Adjustment
shall take into consideration any state-of-the-art technology that is
consistent with the intent of this section as new lighting technology
develops that is useful in reducing light above the horizontal plane.



      (2)   Exceptions. The following types of light fixtures shall
be exempt from the provisions of this section.



         (a)   Low-intensity luminaires. Any luminaire with a
lamp or lamps rated at a total of 1,800 lumens or less, and all flood or spot
luminaires with a lamp or lamps rated at 900 lumens or less, may be used
without restriction to light distribution or mounting height; except that, if
any spot or flood luminaire rated 900 lumens or less is aimed, directed or
focused to cause direct light from the luminaire to be directed toward
residential buildings on adjacent or nearby land, or to create glare
perceptible to persons operating motor vehicles on public ways, the luminaire
shall be redirected or its light output controlled as necessary to eliminate
such conditions.



         (b)   Public street luminaires. Luminaires used for
public street illumination may be installed at a maximum height of 25 feet
and may be positioned at that height up to the edge of any bordering property.



         (c)   Emergency lighting. All temporary emergency
lighting needed by the Police Department, the Fire Department or other
emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaires, shall be exempt from
the requirements of this section.



         (d)   Non-conforming fixtures. All outdoor light
fixtures installed prior to the adoption of the UDC and those equipped with a
permanent automatic shut-off device may remain unchanged; except that, the
subject light fixtures shall not be operated between the hours of 11:00 p.m.
and sunrise.



         (e)   Fossil-fuel light. This type of light is produced
directly or indirectly by the combustion of natural gas or other utility-type
fossil fuels.



         (f)   Low-intensity fixtures. Any outdoor lighting
fixture that has a maximum candle power of less than 1,000 candelas is exempt
from these provisions, if equipped with an automatic device that shuts off
the fixture between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and sunrise.

Design and Maintenance Requirements




Attached squares
 
Attached squares are areas for passive recreational use that are internal to
a block.
 
Minimum size: 2,000 square feet

Maximum size: 1 acre

Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of three sides or 75% of
their perimeter. Squares may be bounded by buildings on a maximum of 60% of
their perimeter (maximum of two sides). Squares shall be planted parallel to
all rights-of-way with at least 2 tree species a minimum of 10 feet and a
maximum of 50 feet on center. All internal tree plantings (if provided) shall
be in geometrical layouts.


Community garden
 
Community gardens are areas where plants are raised and maintained by the
homeowners’ association, condominium association or other established
community association for scientific research, education, aesthetic enjoyment
and recreational purposes.
 
An irrigation system shall be installed in accordance with the landscaping
standards. The area shall be maintained in a neat and clean condition and
cleared of debris.


Courtyard
 
A courtyard is an open area adjacent to, or part of, a building or facility
and is surrounded by building frontages. Courtyards function as gathering
places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent activities, such as
vendors and display stands. Courtyards shall be credited toward parks and
open space requirements only for non-residential use patterns as defined in
§§ 153.0065 through 153.0073, 153.0085 through 153.0094 and 153.0105
through 153.0116 of this chapter and shall be maintained in private ownership.
 
Minimum size: 2,000 square feet

Maximum size: 30,000 square feet

Courtyards shall be paved in brick or other type of paver or crushed stone.
Courtyards shall be level, stepped, or gently sloping (less than 5% grade).
At no time shall a courtyard’s horizontal length or width be greater than
three times the height of the surrounding building(s). Courtyards may be left
unplanted or planted with trees along the edge of the courtyard space or the
structure that the courtyard services. Tree spacing shall be a maximum of 25
feet on center. Parking is not permitted in a courtyard.


Detached square
 
Detached squares are bordered on all sides by streets. Detached squares
provide a means to emphasize important places, intersections or centers.
 
Minimum size: 200 square feet

Maximum size: 1 acre

Detached squares shall be bordered on four sides by a street or walkway. The
geometric pattern of the square shall be a square or a rectangle with a
length not exceeding twice the width.


Forecourt
 
Forecourts are open space areas that act as buffers between residential and
non-residential buildings or streets. Forecourts shall be credited toward
parks and open space requirements only for non-residential use patterns as
defined in §§ 153.0065 through 153.0073, 153.0085 through 153.0094 and
153.0105 through 153.0116 of this chapter, and shall be maintained in private
ownership.
 
Forecourts shall be entirely bounded by streets and shall be planted parallel
to all street rights-of-way with one tree species.


Green
 
The green is an urban open space that is natural in its details. Like the
square, it is small, civic and surrounded by buildings. Unlike the square, it
is informally planted and may have irregular topography.
 
Greens shall be landscaped with trees at the edges and open lawns at the
center. Greens shall contain no structures other than benches, pavilions and
memorials. Trails or pedestrian pathways are optional.


Greenbelts
 
Greenbelts run along the perimeter of a proposed development and buffer a
proposed development from surrounding incompatible uses or features, such as
a highway corridor, industrial district or agricultural areas. Greenbelts
differ from other types of open spaces in that they are left natural and are
not for recreational use.
 
The following uses are permitted within the greenbelt:

• Critical areas;

• Conservancy lots with a minimum lot size of 5 acres and a maximum
impervious surface ratio of 5%; or

• Linear parks improved with trails, benches and/or playground equipment.
Trails, benches and playground equipment are not considered impervious
surfaces for purposes of computing impervious surface.

The greenbelt shall be an average of at least 100 feet in width and at least
50 feet at any point. A greenbelt shall be at least 300 feet in length. Land
shall not be cleared, except for trails.


Greenways
 
Greenways are areas connecting residences and recreational areas. Greenways
are designed to incorporate natural settings, such as creeks and significant
stands of trees within neighborhoods. Parkways and greenways differ from
parks, plazas, and squares in that their detailing is natural (i.e.,
informally planted), except along rights-of-way, and may contain irregular
topography.
 
A greenway shall have an average width of at least 50 feet. If the greenway
consists of agricultural areas, the agricultural areas shall have a
continuous area of at least 50 acres. The agricultural areas may be combined
with adjacent agricultural lands provided, however, that the minimum width
prescribed above shall be met on all portions of the agricultural greenbelt
on the site. Land shall not be cleared, except for trails.


Natural areas and agricultural areas
 
Natural areas are areas established for the protection of natural attributes
of local, regional, and statewide significance, which may be used in a
sustainable manner for scientific research, education, aesthetic enjoyment
and appropriate use not detrimental to the primary purpose. These areas are
resource - rather than user- based, but may provide some passive recreational
activities, such as hiking, nature study and picnicking.
 
Maintenance is limited to a minimum removal and avoidance of hazards,
nuisances or unhealthy conditions. Natural water courses shall be maintained
as free flowing and devoid of debris. Stream channels shall be maintained so
as not to alter floodplain levels. Land shall not be cleared except for
trails.


Park
 
Parks are designed for active recreational use. Parks create a central open
space that services an entire neighborhood or group of neighborhoods or
incorporates physical features that are an asset to the community (e.g., lake
or river frontage, high ground or significant stands of trees). Parks may be
combined with parkways and greenbelts.
 
Minimum size: 1 acre

Parks shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of 50% of their perimeter
(subject to lot line configurations). Trees shall be planted parallel to all
perimeter rights-of-way or at the edge of areas for active recreational use
and any facilities that accompany such use. Tree spacing shall be a minimum
of 15 feet to a maximum of 50 feet on center. Promenades and esplanades
within a park may be formally planted with trees parallel to the walkway.
Interior portions of parks may be kept free of tree plantings. Plantings in
interior portions of parks may follow topographical lines.


Parkway
 
Parkways are open spaces designed to incorporate natural settings, such as
creeks and significant stands of trees within neighborhoods. Parkways and
greenways differ from parks, plazas and squares in that their detailing is
natural (i.e., informally planted), except along rights-of-way, and may
contain irregular topography.
 
Parkways shall be entirely bounded by streets or pedestrian rights-of-way
within developed areas. Parkways may be used for certain active recreational
uses, such as walking, jogging or bicycling. Trees shall be planted along all
rights-of-way a minimum of 10 feet and a maximum of 50 feet on center.
Interior areas shall remain natural or shall be planted with turf grass.


Playgrounds
 
Playgrounds provide play areas for children as well as open shelter with
benches for parents. Playgrounds may be built within squares and parks or may
stand alone within a residential block.
 
Minimum size: 5,000 square feet

Maximum size: 20,000 square feet

Playing surfaces may be covered in sand, wood chips or other equivalent
material. Paths and walkways may be paved in concrete, crushed gravel, brick
paver or similar material, or partially paved.


Plazas
 
Plazas are areas for passive recreational use that are entirely bounded by
streets and/or lanes. Plazas are intended for planned communities, such as
planned developments, transit-oriented developments, traditional neighborhood
developments or non-residential use patterns as defined in §§ 153.0065
through 153.0073, 153.0085 through 153.0094 and 153.0105 through 153.0116 of
this chapter.
 
Minimum width: 200 feet

Minimum length: 300 feet

Maximum width: 530 feet

Maximum length: 800 feet

The plaza shall be square or rectangular with a length of not less that 1-1/2
of its width. The plaza shall be bounded on all sides by streets, with
streets originating in the middle of each side and 2 streets originating from
each corner.




 



   (B)   Exclusions. The following areas are not considered parks or
open space pursuant to this section:

         (a)   The reasonable costs of the park/open space
facilities that have been dedicated shall reduce the fee in lieu of parks or
open space due for only the same type of park facility;



         (b)   The unit costs used to calculate the reduction
shall not exceed those assumed as the average costs of the park/open space
facilities used to compute the fee in lieu of park development for the
benefit area in which the property is located;



         (c)   No reduction shall be granted that exceeds the fee
in lieu of park development due for the development; and



         (d)   Any reduction created by the dedication of park/
open space facilities shall expire ten years after the date that the offset
was created.



      (2)   An applicant may apply for a reduction of fee in lieu of
park development either at the time of approval of a subdivision plat or at
the time of dedication by separate instrument. The applicant may appeal the
determination of the Code Enforcement Officer of parks and recreation
concerning the reduction to the city.



      (3)   The amount of the reduction shall be prorated among the
number of dwelling units approved for the development unless otherwise agreed
to by the city.



   (E)   Timing. Fees in lieu of park and open space development shall
be assessed at the time of plat approval and shall be paid at the time of
plat recordation.



   (F)   Earmarking.



      (1)   All fees collected shall be used for the acquisition or
development of land for a neighborhood park, or development or construction
of improvements to existing unimproved parkland. The park development or
improvement shall be located within one mile of the periphery of the proposed
subdivision development, or within a park benefit district established by
resolution of the city. However, if acquisition opportunities are not
available, or existing parkland is already developed or improved within one
mile of the proposed subdivision development, then areas within two miles of
the periphery of the proposed subdivision development may be considered for
the acquisition of neighborhood parkland and/or construction of improvements
to existing parkland within such periphery.



      (2)   A special fund is established for the deposit of all
fees in lieu of park development. The fund shall be known as the Park
Acquisition and Development Fund. Within the Fund, fees in lieu of park
development paid shall be earmarked for expenditure on park improvements in a
neighborhood park generally located within the distance described in
subsection (F)(1) above. All fees in lieu of park development paid must be
expended within ten years from the date of receipt for park facilities
benefitting the residential subdivision or dwelling unit for which the fees
are paid. Fees shall be considered expended if they are spent for acquisition
or development, respectively, of neighborhood parks located within one-half
to one mile of the subdivision for which the fees were paid within the
ten-year period. If fees are not expended within such period, the
then-current owner shall be entitled to a refund of the principal deposited
by the applicant in such Fund, together with accrued interest. The owner must
request such refund in writing within 365 days of entitlement or such right
shall be waived. Interest accruing to the Parkland Dedication Fund and to the
Park Development Fund shall be expended on neighborhood parkland acquisition
and for neighborhood park improvements, respectively.

§ 153.1020  PARK AND OPEN SPACE CHARACTERISTICS.



   The standards provided below ensure that all designated parks and/or
open space are usable and have suitable size, location, dimension,
topography, character and access.



   (A)   Generally. The required park or open space areas shall be
provided as common areas for the use of all residents/occupants of the
proposed development. Land designated as a park or open space shall be
maintained as a park or open space and may not be separately sold, subdivided
or developed except as provided in subsections (B) through (J) below.



   (B)   Designation.



      (1)   Any areas reserved as a park or open space shall be
indicated on the application for development approval. A parks and open space
provision and maintenance plan shall be submitted as a part of the
application for development approval, including the project phasing schedule.
This plan shall designate and indicate the boundaries of all proposed parks
or open space required by this section and the type of park or open space
provided.



      (2)   Platted lots located within subdivisions and planned
developments shall be located outside of the parks and open space areas.
Parks and open space shall be placed in undivided preserves.



   (C)   School site locations. Park sites shall be located, whenever
possible, adjacent to and contiguous with school sites in order to make
maximum use of common facilities and grounds. Land area dedicated to a school
district shall be credited toward the minimum requirements of § 153.1017 of
this chapter if there is a joint use agreement between the city and the
school district.



   (D)   Distance from lots. Parks and open space shall be not be
further than one-half mile from any lot or, if the proposed development does
not involve a subdivision or any principal building, this distance shall be
measured from the entrance allowing people, bicycles or equestrians to enter
into the park or open space or to view the park or open space area. This
distance shall be measured in a straight line; provided that, the distance
shall not be interrupted by an existing arterial street. The distance may be
measured from a park or open space provided pursuant to this section or a
public park or public open space area not provided by the applicant.



   (E)   Parks or open space in floodplains or water features.



      (1)   Areas within a floodplain shall not exceed 50% of the
area counted as parks or open space, except as provided by subsection (E)(2)
below. Water features exceeding 2,500 square feet shall not be considered as
parks or open space unless permitted by subsection (E)(2) below.



      (2)   The restriction on the maximum percentage of parks/open
space in water features or floodplains (hereinafter “restricted areas”)
can be increased to 75% where:



         (a)   An area of a minimum 25 feet in width surrounding
a restricted area is improved as a greenway;



         (b)   The structures or activities located with the
restricted areas do not cause an increase in base flood elevations;



         (c)   The velocities during a ten-year flood event do
not exceed six feet per second; and



         (d)   For parks/open space dedicated to the city, at
least one acre is located outside of the restricted area.



   (F)   Percentage in retention or detention areas.



      (1)   Not more than 25% or one acre, whichever is less, of a
retention area or detention basin required as part of the storm water
management standards (§§ 153.1035 through 153.1053 of this chapter) qualify
as a park or open space area, subject to the requirements established in this
section.



      (2)   50 percent or more of the active and usable area shall
be above the 25-year storm level and designed for multiple uses.



      (3)   Retention or detention areas used as park or open space
shall be included as part of a greenbelt or a greenway. Retention or
detention areas shall not be inundated in such a manner that they become
unsuitable for their designated recreational purposes.



      (4)   Retention or detention areas shall be constructed of
natural materials. Terracing, berming and contouring is required in order to
naturalize and enhance the aesthetics of the basin.



      (5)   Basin slopes shall not exceed a 3:1 slope.



   (G)   Walls and fences. Walls and fences, if used, shall not exceed
six feet in height. This requirement does not apply to fences used in
conjunction with athletic fields and tennis courts.



   (H)   Buffers or landscaped areas. Any buffer or landscaped area
provided pursuant to §§ 153.1120 through 153.1130, 153.1175 through
153.1177, 153.1190 and 153.1191 of this chapter that meets the requirements
of Table 153.1018(A) of this chapter for a particular category of parks or
open space shall be credited toward the minimum parks and open space
requirements of §§ 153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter.



   (I)   Slopes. At least 50% of required dedicated park or open space
land shall have slopes less than 7%.



   (J)   Access. Parks and/or open space provided pursuant to this
section shall have direct access to a public street or to a private street
maintained by an HOA, condominium association or apartment association.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.21.5)



§ 153.1021  DESIGNATION OF PARKS/OPEN SPACE.



   Areas designated as parks or open space shall not be subdivided but
shall be shown as a “park” or “open space” on a plat. Land protected
pursuant to this section that is intended to be used as a park shall be
deeded as a park, regardless of ownership. In order to ensure that open space
areas are maintained so that their use and enjoyment as parks and/or open
space are not diminished or destroyed, parks and/or open space areas may be
owned, preserved and maintained by any mechanism or combination described in
§ 153.0980 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.21.6)



§ 153.1022  DEVELOPMENT PHASING.



   This section establishes a procedure for enforcing the requirements for
parks and open space through development phasing while providing flexibility
in the development approval process. This procedure recognizes that there is
usually a delay between the date when a subdivision plat is approved and when
lots are built upon and occupied, thus creating a demand for parks and open
space.



   (A)   In residential subdivisions that are to be platted in two or
more phases, the required park or open space dedication must be provided in
each phase of the subdivision, except as provided in subsection (B) below.



   (B)   If a subdivision is proposed in phases, the applicant may plat
the first 100 lots pursuant to the preliminary plat and defer the provision
of parks and/or open space to future phases of the development. No further
subdivision plat shall be approved unless and until parks or open space are
provided in increments equal to the acreage required by § 153.1017 of this
chapter, subject to the phasing provisions of Table 153.1022(A) below.



 

Table 153.1022(A): Development Phasing for Parks and Open Space

Phase 3 through completion of development
 
As required by § 153.1017
 
At time of platting



 



   (C)   If any phase of the subdivision is platted without providing
the required parks or open space at the time of platting and no future
subdivision phases are planned pursuant to the preliminary plat, the parks or
open space required shall be provided within one year after recordation of
the plat and shall be secured by deferment contract as provided in subsection
(D) below.



   (D)   The city may authorize the developer to reserve parkland for
dedication in subsequent phases of the subdivision by executing an
enforceable contract with the city. The contract shall be approved as to form
by the City Attorney. In addition, the developer shall dedicate a
reversionary public access easement on the final plat of the proposed
development where necessary to provide effective public access, maintenance
and use of any parkland to be dedicated.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.21.7)



§ 153.1023  CONNECTIVITY.



   (A)   The city finds and determines that an interconnected system of
parks, trails, green-ways and bikeways provides a greater public benefit than
isolated parks with access exclusively by automobiles. Such areas can provide
form to neighborhoods, a common public gathering space and an opportunity to
protect natural areas.



   (B)   Accordingly, this section provides incentives for developers
to link parks and open space provided pursuant to this section with other
public or private park and open space areas. It is not the intent of this
section to require developers or landowners to provide a general public
benefit, but rather to create incentives for creativity in the design of
parks and open space as well as creative opportunities to meet the
requirements of this section.



   (C)   Greenbelts, greenways or linear parks provided pursuant to
this subsection shall be credited toward the minimum park and open space area
requirements of § 153.1017 of this chapter at a ratio of one acre for every
20,000 square feet provided, where:



      (1)   Such areas are aligned with a continuation of an area
designated as a public greenway, linear park or similar facility in a
facilities plan officially adopted by the city; and



      (2)   Such areas include sidewalks, trails or similar
facilities that align with such facilities in an abutting tract or, where
abutting tracts are unimproved, conform to the specifications set forth in
the facilities plan.



   (D)   Parks or open space provided pursuant to this subsection (D)
shall be credited toward the minimum park and open space area requirements at
a ratio of one acre for every 20,000 square feet provided, where:



      (1)   All lots within the proposed subdivision are within
one-fourth mile of the park or open space; and



      (2)   The park or open space area abuts an area zoned “CN”
(Commercial Neighborhood) or the area designated as a “center” in a TND.

STORM WATER MANAGEMENT



§ 153.1035  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   The purpose of this section is to provide adequate measures for the
retention, detention and distribution of storm water in a manner that
minimizes the possibility of adverse impacts on both water quantity and water
quality during development.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22)



§ 153.1036  APPLICABILITY.



   This section applies to any application for subdivision plat, site plan
or development approval, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. A
storm water management plan shall be provided as set forth in §§ 153.1645
through 153.1658 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.1)



§ 153.1037  REGIONAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.



   (A)   The city has determined that regional storm water management
is preferable to site-specific storm water mitigation. The regional storm
water management program (RSWMP) provides for the administration, planning,
design, construction and operational management of regional storm water
facilities (RSWFs).



   (B)   Regional storm water management uses a watershed-wide approach
to analyze potential flooding problems, identify appropriate mitigation
measures and select site locations and design criteria for RSWFs. These RSWFs
include, but are not limited to, regional detention and retention ponds,
watershed protection, land purchase, waterway enlargement, channelization and
improved conveyance structures. The RSWMP allows developers to participate in
the program rather than constructing the on-site detention controls required
by §§ 153.1040 through 153.1053 of this chapter, where the resulting use of
an RSWF will not produce a significantly adverse impact to other properties
due to the increased run-off from the proposed development.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.2)



§ 153.1038  OPTIONS.



   Options available to developers to participate in the RSWMP include:



   (A)   Payment of a fee in lieu of on-site detention. The fee
schedule is established by resolution of the city;



   (B)   Construction of an RSWF to mitigate an existing flooding
problem; and



   (C)   Construction or participation in the construction of an RSWF
to mitigate increased storm water run-off anticipated by ultimate development
of the watershed.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.3)



§ 153.1039  TIMING OF PAYMENT.



   The storm water development fee in lieu of on-site detention must be
paid prior to a plat being released for recordation by the city or the
issuance of a development approval. The fee shall be determined in accordance
with the resolution established pursuant to § 153.1038(A) of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.4)



§ 153.1040  SYSTEM CRITERIA.



   (A)   Design conditions. All storm water management facilities shall
be designed for ultimate development. Three development conditions shall be
analyzed for each development. (See Table 153.1040(A) below.)



   (B)   Design storm event. Facilities with drainage areas under 100
acres shall be designed for a 25-year storm. Facilities with drainage areas
over 100 acres or areas within a designated floodplain shall be designed for
a 100-year storm or a 25-year storm, plus freeboard, if that elevation is
higher. Detention facilities and streets are exceptions to the frequency
criteria cited in this section. Detention facility outflows will be designed
for five-, 25- and 100-year frequency storms.



   (C)   Responsibility to accept storm water.



      (1)   The owner or developer of property to be developed is
responsible for the conveyance of all storm water flowing through the
property. This responsibility includes storm water flowing onto the property
by any other developed property as well as the drainage naturally flowing
through the property by reason of topography.

storm events, except as provided in § 153.1038 of this chapter.



   (B)   Redevelopment. Peak storm water run-off rates from an area of
redevelopment due to zoning or replatting shall be less than or equal to the
peak run-off rates produced by existing development conditions for the five-,
25- and 100-year design storm events, except as provided in § 153.1038 of
this chapter.

§ 153.1043  DRAINAGE EASEMENTS/RIGHTS-OF-WAY.



   (A)   Applicability. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, natural channel, or stream, an easement or
right-of-way shall be indicated on the subdivision plat or site plan that
conforms substantially to the limit of such watercourse, plus additional
width required by the applicable storm water management facility.



   (B)   Natural watercourses or floodplains.



      (1)   Easements for natural watercourses shall be the 100-year
floodplain or the 25-year, plus freeboard.



      (2)   A driveable accessway shall be provided in floodplain
easements for the length of the easement when regular maintenance of the
floodplain is required.



   (C)   Maintenance access right-of-way.



      (1)   An unobstructed access right-of-way connecting the
drainage easement with an alley or roadway parallel to or near the easement
shall be provided at a minimum spacing of one access right-of-way at
approximately 1,000-foot intervals.



      (2)   The access right-of-way shall be a minimum of 15 feet in
width and shall be maintained clear of obstructions that limit maintenance
vehicle access.



      (3)   If the flow line of the designed channel incorporates
grade control structures or vehicular bridges that prevent maintenance
equipment from accessing that portion of the channel, additional access
points may be required.



      (4)   Channel design, earthen or concrete, shall have ramps in
the side slopes near the access points that allow maintenance equipment to
descend to the floor level of the channel.



      (5)   The maximum allowable ramp slope for vehicular access is
7:1.



   (D)   Lot and property line crossings.



      (1)   Where drainage easements cross lot and property lines, a
statement shall be added to the plat that no fencing or structures that will
interfere with drainage flow are permitted on or across such lines.



      (2)   Fencing may be allowed across drainage easements only in
accordance with the following restrictions:



         (a)   The bottom of the fence shall be a minimum of the
flow depth, plus freeboard above the design flow line of channel or drain; and



         (b)   Fence posts located within the easement must be
structurally designed to resist damage from the stormwater flows and impact
from debris.



   (E)   Interceptor easements. Interceptor drainage easements and
channels shall be provided where the drainage area to the back of platted
lots exceeds the depth of two average residential lots. Interceptor drains
shall be constructed prior to the issuance of development approvals on any
lot that is affected by the intercepted natural drainage being intercepted.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.8)



§ 153.10431  LOWER ELEVATION OF SITE.



   (A)   All developments shall provide for adequate drainage outfall
at the lower end of the site into an existing street, alley, drainage,
easements or right-of-way, or to the centerline of an existing natural drain.



   (B)   Where the proposed street, storm sewer or open channel does
not discharge into a natural low area or into an existing drainage easement,
then facilities and drainage easements of adequate width to contain the
design discharge shall be constructed and dedicated to the centerline of an
existing natural low area within the same watershed.



   (C)   However, where the natural low area lies within the
developer’s property, the developer will be required only to plat an
easement to the centerline of the natural low area; provided that, the
easement is adequate to accommodate the facilities that will be built in
conjunction with the future development of that property.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.8)



§ 153.1044  SITE DESIGN AND GRADING.



   (A)   A note must be placed on the plat for residential lots stating
that finished floor elevations must be a minimum of eight inches above final
adjacent grade.



   (B)   A grading plan shall be prepared and submitted to the Code
Enforcement Officer indicating typical lot grading for all lots in the

§ 153.1046  STORM WATER DETENTION.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to a proposed development
that creates a net increase in impervious area of at least 4,000 square feet,
and that elects not to participate or is not eligible to participate in the
RSWMP.



   (B)   Level of service. Standard storm water detention shall
mitigate peak flow rates to predevelopment or existing development conditions.



   (C)   Maximum outflow rate. The maximum allowable outflow rate from
the detention facility must be restricted to the flow rate from the
undeveloped or existing development tract for the five-, 25- and 100-year
frequency. The timing of the hydrograph released from the detention facility
must be checked against the timing of the flow rate in the first open
watercourse to prevent any increase in the peak flow rate in the receiving
watercourse. For detention basins constructed in line on an existing
watercourse, the creation of the basin shall not increase flood elevations in
the channel upstream of the new development boundaries.

§ 153.1047  MULTI-USE FACILITIES.



   The use of multi-use detention facilities to alleviate existing
flooding problems, enhance and provide amenities for older neighborhoods, and
support the revitalization of economically depressed areas is encouraged in
public and private redevelopment initiatives. Multi-use facilities are storm
water management facilities that provide storm water management functions and
other benefits, such as water quality improvement, water recharge, open
space, recreation or habitat. Multi-use facilities are encouraged, but not
required by this section. Such facilities shall meet the standards set forth
in § 153.1037 of this chapter and shall not increase the rate or volume of
erosion above, resulting from the use of a facility without multiple uses.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.12)



§ 153.1048  LOCATION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.



   Storm water detention facilities (Figure 153.1047(A) of this chapter)
shall be located in topographically depressed areas.

§ 153.1049  STREETS FOR STORM WATER DRAINAGE.



   (A)   Generally. Streets shall be designed to avoid conflicts
between storm water conveyance, traffic, parking, pedestrian access, ADA
requirements and bicycle traffic.



   (B)   Standards.



      (1)   Streets draining a watershed greater than 100 acres must
be designed for the 100-year frequency storm.







Figure 153.1048(A): Sustainable Open Space



This “rain garden” in Carpenter Village (Mooresville, North Carolina)
drains three acres with underground rain storage and provides passive open
space as part of a public green.



      (2)   Streets may be used for storm water drainage only if the
calculated storm water flow does not exceed the flows outlined in Table
153.1065(A) of this chapter or the velocity does not exceed ten feet per
second.



      (3)   Where streets are not capable of carrying storm-waters,
inlets or curb openings discharging to drainage channels or storm sewers
shall be provided. Partial flow past the inlet will be allowed when the
capacity of all downstream street systems can accommodate the flow.



      (4)   Street width shall not be widened beyond the width as
determined by the street classification for drainage purposes.



      (5)   Storm water conveyance on streets shall be designed to
account for the cumulative impact of peak flows and run-off volumes on the
system as it progresses downgrade.



      (6)   Curb cuts for driveways on all streets shall be designed
for compatibility with the storm water conveyance function of streets.



      (7)   Potential flooding problems or conflicts at the
connection points where new or modified drainage systems (including streets
and storm sewers) and the existing portions of the downstream street system
and storm water conveyance system shall be identified and resolved, either in
the design of the new or modified drainage system or in modifications to the
existing system.



      (8)   Dwelling units located on the downhill side of a
T-intersection with a street or drainage channel discharging onto the
intersection shall be sited in order to avoid obstruction of the drainage
patterns.



   (C)   All-weather crossings. Where streets cross existing or
proposed watercourses, all-weather crossings are required. Culverts or
bridges shall be adequate to allow passage of the design storm identified in
§ 153.1037 of this chapter.



   (D)   Standards by street classification. The storm water capacity
for streets shall conform to Table 153.1065(A) and Table 153.1065(B) of this
chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.14)



§ 153.1050  DRAINAGE CHANNELS AND WATERCOURSES.



   (A)   Applicability. This section addresses proposed improvements or
modifications to drainage channels and watercourses required to convey storm
water runoff from or through the proposed development.



   (B)   Standards.



      (1)   Except as authorized by a development plan approved by
the Code Enforcement Officer, no person shall place any obstruction of any
kind in any watercourse within the city, except where specifically permitted
by the UDC. The owner of any property within the city, through which any
watercourse may pass, shall keep the watercourse free from any obstruction
not designated on a subdivision plat or site plan.



      (2)   Modifications to existing watercourses or newly created
open channels may be designed as earth, sodded or as concrete-lined channels.
Liners other than sod or concrete that enhance the aesthetics or habitat
value of the watercourse and that reduce future maintenance requirements are
permitted. Preliminary planning for the applicability of other channel liners
shall be reviewed with the Code Enforcement Officer prior to the submittal of
construction plans for approval.



      (3)   (a)   A maintenance schedule for any private channel
shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Official prior to approval
of construction plans. Maintenance requirements of concrete channels consist
of desilting activities, prevention of vegetation establishment in
construction joints and repair of concrete, as necessary. Maintenance of
earthen channels includes regular observation and repair as necessary of
erosion, scouring and removal of silt deposits, as necessary to maintain
design parameters. Applicants shall maintain newly planted channels until
coverage is established throughout 85% of the area. This area shall include
slopes, floor and any attendant maintenance easement. New earthen channels
shall be planted with drought-resistant, low-growth, native-species grasses,
which will allow unobstructed passage of flood waters. Johnsongrass, Giant
Ragweed and other invasive species are not permitted in channels.



         (b)   These species shall include Common Bermuda,
Coastal Bermuda, Buffalo Grass, Sideoats Grama, Seep Muhly, Little Bluestem,
Indiangrass or other species approved by the City Manager that meet the
standards of this section. Mowing frequencies vary with the vegetation growth
rates, but is required when the grass exceeds the design roughness
coefficient of the channel.



   (C)   Velocity criteria.Table 153.1065(B) shall be used to determine
the type of storm water management facility that is used.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.15)



§ 153.1051  CONCRETE CHANNELS.



   Concrete-lined channels shall not be used at velocities less than six
feet per second unless a variance is granted pursuant to Divisions 7, 8, 9
and 10 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.16)



§ 153.1052  STORM SEWERS.



   (A)   Storm sewers shall have sufficient capacity to accommodate
full flow under the design discharge, pressure heads and outfalls.



   (B)   Storm sewer pipe size and materials shall be approved in
writing by the Director of Public Works or shall be specified by a licensed
professional engineer.



   (C)   Storm sewer easements shall have a minimum width of 15 feet,
or six feet on both sides of the extreme limits of the storm sewer, whichever
is greater.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.17; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.1053  INLETS AND OPENINGS.



   Inlets and openings shall comply with the then current Illinois
Department of Transportation Drainage Manual.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.22.18)



STREET DESIGN AND TRANSPORTATION



§ 153.1065  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS; APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. These regulations are designed to:



      (1)   Ensure that the design of streets conforms to the
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan;



      (2)   Provide for the safety for both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic;



      (3)   Provide for livable residential and commercial
environments;



      (4)   Provide economy of land use, construction and
maintenance; and



      (5)   Provide safe and efficient access to property. Unlike
the situation in traditional subdivision regulations, one intent of this
section is to permit narrower street widths while requiring greater
connectivity in order to more efficiently disperse traffic, to protect
pedestrians from high vehicular speeds and to enhance the streetscape. The
city further finds and determines that street layout and design can have a
very significant influence on the total imperviousness and hydrology of a
site. Alternative road layout can result in significantly reducing
imperviousness, reducing storm water run-off, protecting water quality and
providing cost savings for developers and home buyers.

(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.1)



§ 153.1066  CLASSIFICATION.



   (A)   Conventional. Classification of an existing or proposed street
not already identified on the major street plan, for the purpose of
determining the appropriate design of a roadway or development, or for the
purpose of determining the appropriateness of a location for a proposed use,
shall be done by the Code Enforcement Officer. Pursuant to the major street
plan, the classification system, as described in Table 153.1067(A) of this
chapter, is adopted.



   (B)   Factors. In determining the classification of a street,
factors to be considered include the following existing or proposed features:



      (1)   Facility geometrics, including the number and width of
traffic lanes, turning lanes and parking lanes;



      (2)   Access conditions, including any restrictions on access,
the spacing of private accesses and average lot frontages;



      (3)   Traffic characteristics, including average daily
traffic, percentage of trucks, average operating speed, percentage of turning
movements, origin-destination characteristics of the traffic and peak-hour
characteristics of traffic; and



      (4)   Adjacent land uses.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.2)



§ 153.1067  GEOMETRIC DESIGN.



   Interior streets within the subdivision or development parcel shall
conform to the standards described in Table 153.1067(A) below.



   (A)   Row (A): Street Classifications.



      (1)   Street types shall be indicated on the preliminary and
final subdivision plats.



      (2)   Lane street types are permitted for a TND or
transit-oriented development (TOD) if the abutting buildings are provided
with:



         (a)   A National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 13D fire
sprinkler system in the case of single-family dwelling units, single-family
attached dwelling units, two-family (duplex) dwelling units and two-family
attached dwelling units;



         (b)   An NFPA 13R fire sprinkler system for multi-family
buildings; or



         (c)   An NFPA 13 fire sprinkler system for commercial
buildings.



   (B)   Row (B): Right-of-Way. Right-of-way width depends on the
number of travel lanes and parking lanes provided. The dimensions are in feet
and are a minimum width. The right-of-way includes all travel lanes, medians,
sidewalks and bike lanes.



   (C)   Row (C): Travel Lanes. Row (C) refers to the number of travel
lanes required. Travel lanes shall be a minimum of:



      (1)   Nine feet for lanes and local streets (traditional
street design criteria);



      (2)   Ten feet in width for alleys, local roads, and rural
streets;



      (3)   Eleven feet in width for avenues, main streets,
boulevards, and subcollectors; and



      (4)   Twelve feet for all other streets.



   (D)   Row (D): Parking Lanes. Row (D) refers to the minimum number
of parking lanes. If two lanes are required, one parking lane shall be
provided on each side of the street. Parking lanes shall be a minimum of
eight feet in width. For local streets and subcollectors, excluding rural
streets, one parking lane may be included, in which case total required
pavement width shall increase by an additional eight feet.



   (E)   Row (E): Pavement Width. Row (E) refers to the minimum width
of the traveled way and any parking lanes, in feet, from the back of the curb
(BOC) for curbed streets and to the edge of the pavement for all other
streets. All streets shall be paved with a hard surface. Gravel or other
loose surfacing material is not permitted.



   (F)   Row (F): Corner Radius. Row (F) refers to the minimum radius,
in feet, of the curb located at the street intersection of a block corner.



   (G)   Row (G): Centerline Radius. Row (G) refers to the radius, in
feet, described by the radius of the circle formed by a curve that is tangent
to the centerline of the road.



   (H)   Row (H): Drainage. In Row (H), “CG” means curb and gutter;
“A” means any combination of curb and gutter, swales, and shoulders;
“SW” means swales; and “SH” means shoulders. All curbed streets shall
be built in accordance with the IDOT Specifications for vertical curb and
gutter construction. Gutters shall be at least two feet in width, while
gutters for lanes and street medians shall be at least one foot. For rural
streets, the City Manager may waive the requirement for curb and gutter where
buildings or structures are located on only one side of the street, and the
lots or parcels abutting the opposite side of the street are reserved for
parks or open space. For a promenade, the curb and gutter may be installed on
one or both sides of the facility.



   (I)   Row (I): Grade. Row (I) refers to the maximum slope of a
street, in percent. Street and alley grades shall conform to the terrain. No
street or alley grade shall be less than 0.5% if curb and gutter are
provided. The minimum cross-slope of a road shall be 2% and the maximum shall
be 4%.

Expressway


Collector
 
As the principal traffic artery within residential or commercial areas, the
collector carries relatively high traffic volumes and conveys traffic from
arterial streets to lower-order streets. Its function is to promote the free
flow of traffic
 
1,000 - 3,000
 
Boulevard

Main street


Local street
 
As the lowest-order street, the access street usually carries no through
traffic. With properly designed access streets without through traffic,
travel distances from residences to collector streets are short, traffic
speeds are low, lane capacity and design speed are not controlling design
factors, and minor delays are inconsequential considerations. Drivers and
residents expect and accept both brief delays and the need to decrease speed

Subcollector
 
The subcollector provides passage to access streets and conveys traffic to
collectors. Like access streets, the subcollector provides frontage and
access to residential lots but also carries some through traffic to
lower-order (access) streets. The subcollector is a relatively low-volume
street

NOTES TO TABLE:

NA = the standard does not apply.

For rules of interpretation, see subsections “Row (A): Street
Classifications” through “Row (O): Trees” of this chapter. Where a
number is stated as a range, the street may include any dimension or number
within the range at the discretion of the applicant. The methodology for
calculating the geometric design factors shall conform to the engineering
specifications and AASHTO Green Book: A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets, 5th ed. (Washington, DC: American Association of State
and Highway Transportation Officials, 2004), unless a different standard is
prescribed in this section.




 



   (J)   Row (J): Median.



      (1)   Width. Where median widths are specified in Row (J), a
median of at least the designated width shall be provided.



      (2)   Entrance roads. Entrance roads shall include a median
that complies with these requirements. Islands and medians shall be a minimum
of 75 square feet in size.



      (3)   Visibility. Structures, permanent materials or plantings
within the island shall not obscure the visibility of cars entering a cross
street for a distance of 20 feet back from the curb face of the cross street,
unless a larger setback is needed due to inadequate sight distance created by
horizontal or vertical curve alignment.



      (4)   Planting materials. Large to medium trees shall be
planted within the median. The minimum median width for tree planting is 18
feet. Where left turn lanes are provided, the minimum width is eight feet.



      (5)   Spacing. One medium tree shall be planted every 50 feet
and shall be a minimum of six feet from the BOC. Where left turn lanes and/or
crossovers are provided, the planting shall begin 15 feet from the nose of
the turning island. Preservation of existing trees and understory vegetation
may be used to meet this requirement.



   (K)   Row (K): Block Length. Row (K) is the maximum block length, in
feet.



   (L)   Row (L): Sidewalks. Row (L) refers to the minimum and maximum
width, in feet, of sidewalks. For parkways, the sidewalks shall take the form
of multi-use greenways, which may meander at a distance of between six to 15
feet from the paved section of the roadway. (See § 153.1074 of this chapter
for sidewalk design requirements). Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides
of the pavement section for all streets.



   (M)   Row (M): Planting Strip. Row (M) refers to the minimum width,
in feet, of the planting strip, located between the curb and sidewalk
parallel with the street. For main streets, grated tree wells shall be used
in lieu of planting strips.



   (N)   Row (N): Bike Lanes.



      (1)   Row (N) indicates whether bike lanes are required. Bike
lanes may be included as individual bike lanes reserved for bicyclists,
combined with trails, or striped as part of the street system. Bike lanes
shall conform to the geometric design criteria as shown in Table 153.1068(A)
of this chapter.



      (2)   Bike lanes shall connect to and align with the city’s
bike lane plan and bike lanes on abutting property. Dimensional standards for
bike route signage shall comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD). Bike paths shall be paved with a minimum 2-inch thick
asphaltic concrete top course placed on a six-inch thick select granular
subbase. The right-of-way outside of the paved lane shall be graded to
provide clearance from trees, poles, walls, fences, guardrails or other
lateral obstructions.



   (O)   Row (O): Trees. Column (O) indicates whether street trees are
required. Street tree planting areas shall be a minimum of four feet. Street
trees shall be located within the right-of-way on both sides of and parallel
to the street. If sidewalks are used, street trees shall be located between
the sidewalk and curb.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.3)



§ 153.1068  CONNECTIVITY.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. The city finds that discontinuous street
systems are inefficient. Channel traffic onto relatively few points of the
transportation network causes undue congestion. A well-connected street
network spreads traffic efficiently, provides greater opportunities for
access by service and emergency vehicles and furthers pedestrian mobility by
increasing the number of destinations that can be reached by walking.
Accordingly, this section provides for both external and internal
connectivity. External connectivity is promoted by requiring developers to
connect to the existing street network. Internal connectivity is promoted by
requiring a connectivity index for internal streets. The city acknowledges
that there is a market for cul-de-sacs and streets with few connections. The
connectivity index preserves the opportunity to provide cul-de-sacs while
maintaining the integrity of the network as a whole.



   (B)   Connectivity index for internal streets. The streets within
any proposed subdivision shall provide a connectivity index of at least 1.20.
A use pattern established by Division 2 of this chapter may require a higher
ratio. The connectivity ratio is computed by dividing the number of street
links by the number of nodes within the subdivision. For purposes of this
section, the intersection of a local street within the proposed subdivision
with an arterial or collector street providing access to a proposed
subdivision is not considered a node in computing the connectivity ratio. The
connectivity ratio does not apply to minor subdivisions.



   (C)   Projecting streets. Where abutting areas are not subdivided,
the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall connect the streets to
the unsubdivided areas. Parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of
future streets and logical further subdivision. Where streets change design
in alignment and width, the street design shall provide a transition
sufficient to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. This section is not
intended to require local streets to project into floodplains, bluffs or
other natural features or existing development that has not made
accommodations for connection. (See Figure 153.1068(A) below.)

   (G)   Non-access easement. Where the connectivity index required in
subsection (B) above is not reduced, a vehicular non-access easement is
permitted to control ingress and egress to vehicular traffic.



   (H)   Secondary access. At least one access point into a
single-family residential subdivision shall be provided for every 2,640 feet
(one-half mile) of frontage. Where a single-family residential subdivision
exceeds 125 units, a secondary access will be required.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.4)



§ 153.1069  CUL-DE-SACS.



   (A)   Generally. The city finds and determines that the use of
cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets is inconsistent with the public policy of
preserving an interconnected street system. Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets
do not promote street connectivity, and create inefficiencies in the
distribution of traffic and water as well as inefficiencies and increased
municipal expenses in the delivery of public services. In limited situations,
cul-de-sacs can be used to avoid disturbing sensitive environmental features.
In addition, there is a strong market demand for cul-de-sac lots in many
communities. Accordingly, this section restricts the use of cul-de-sacs to
appropriate situations and establishes standards for development that utilize
cul-de-sac streets.



   (B)   Applicability. A cul-de-sac is a street, or a system of
streets, having only one end open to traffic and the other end being
permanently terminated and a vehicular turn-around provided. However, in
situations where cul-de-sacs are permitted, they shall comply with this
section. This section does not apply to a conservation subdivision use
pattern. Cul-de-sacs are not permitted for the TND or TOD use patterns.



   (C)   Modification generally. An applicant seeking a modification
from this section shall demonstrate that the strict application of subsection
(B) above will produce unnecessary hardship as the result of extreme
topographic conditions. For purposes of this section, the following shall be
considered “extreme topographic conditions”:



      (1)   Slopes exceeding 20%;



      (2)   Marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, streams or ponds; and



      (3)   Areas within a critical area protected by Division 13 of
this chapter.



   (D)   Right-of-way and pavement design.



      (1)   Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets shall terminate in
circular rights-of-way having a minimum pavement width radius of 45 feet for
residential uses and 60 feet for commercial/industrial uses.



      (2)   In no event shall the cul-de-sac exceed the lengths
established in Column (B) of Table 153.1069(A) below.



   (E)   Access restriction. The site plan or subdivision plat shall
show a stub connecting the cul-de-sac to adjoining areas or parcels where
future roadways are delineated in the thoroughfare plan or a recorded
subdivision or site plan. The stub shall be improved as a pedestrian walkway,
trail or bikeway.



   (F)   Landscaping.



      (1)   At least 40% of the bulb of the cul-de-sac shall be
landscaped in accordance with the standards set forth in the standards for
subdivision entrance landscaping (§§ 153.1190 and 153.1191 of this chapter).



      (2)   For cul-de-sacs with a radius exceeding 80 feet, at
least 25 square feet of the area within the turnaround area shall be
landscaped. (See Figure 153.1069(A) below.)

§ 153.1071  STREET NAMES AND SIGNAGE.



   (A)   Generally. Names of new streets shall not duplicate the names
of existing streets unless the new street continues or aligns with an
existing street. All new street names shall be submitted to and approved by
the U.S. Postal Service.



   (B)   Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all
intersections within and abutting the subdivision. Such signs shall be
manufactured and installed by the subdivider in accordance with
specifications of, and subject to plan reviews and inspections by, the City
Manager. Street name signs shall not be accepted by the city until the street
has been accepted for maintenance by the city, unless approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer in order to provide mail service.



   (C)   Warning and regulatory traffic signs. Within the city limits,
warning and regulatory traffic signs shall be installed within and shall abut
the subdivision in accordance with the MUTCD.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.7)



§ 153.1072  STREET LIGHTS.



   Street lights shall be provided in all subdivisions within the city.
Street lights shall conform to the IDOT specifications.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.8)



§ 153.1073  PRIVATE STREETS.



   (A)   Applicability. Private streets are permitted within Planned
Development (“PD”) Districts.



   (B)   Private street geometric design. The design standards and
construction specifications of private streets shall be the same as for
public streets.



   (C)   Certification. Upon completion of construction, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall be provided with a written certification signed by
a professional engineer, certifying that the private streets and sidewalks
were designed and installed as required by this section.



   (D)   Maintenance. Private streets and sidewalks shall be owned and
maintained by an HOA, a community association or other legal entity
established for this purpose.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.9)



§ 153.1074  PAVEMENT DESIGN.



   (A)   Pavement structure. The design of pavement structures shall
conform to the Guide for Design of Pavement Structures. The pavement design
report shall be prepared and signed by, or shall be under the supervision of,
a professional engineer.



   (B)   Length of service life. Pavement shall be designed for a
20-year service life.



   (C)   Serviceability. The “serviceability” of a pavement is
defined as the pavement’s ride quality and its ability to serve the type of
traffic (e.g., automobiles and trucks) that uses the facility. The initial
serviceability index (p0) for flexible pavements shall be 4.2; for rigid
pavements, it shall be 4.5. The minimum terminal serviceability index (Pt)
for local streets shall be 2.0; for collectors and arterials, it shall be
2.5. A standard deviation (S0) for flexible pavement shall be 0.45; for rigid
pavement, it shall be 0.35.



   (D)   Roadbed soil.



      (1)   A soil investigation must be performed for the design of
pavement structures. The number of borings and locations shall be sufficient
to accurately determine the stratum along the route. Any existing soil
information that is available either from the city or from private sources
will be evaluated and, if determined to be applicable and valid, will be
allowed in place of new soil tests.



      (2)   Roadbed soil having a plasticity index (PI) greater than
20 shall be treated with lime to reduce the PI below 20. Application rate of
lime shall be determined based on laboratory testing. In no case shall the
lime be less than 15 pounds per square yard for six inches of lime-treated
subgrade. Lime-treated subgrade will be included as a “structural layer”
within the pavement design calculations. Proposals for stabilization
alternatives in place of the use of lime will be considered upon submittal of
an engineering report verifying adequate stabilization of the highly plastic
soil.



      (3)   Where the roadbed is in a rock excavation, a
“structural layer” within the pavement design calculations can be used
that is equivalent to a structural layer for lime-stabilized subgrade. If a
roadbed structural layer is used in the pavement calculation for rock
subgrade, an engineering report will be provided to public works addressing
the consistency of the subgrade prior to base placement.



   (E)   Pavement layer material. The combination of the following
materials are permitted for the pavement structure:



      (1)   Lime treatment for subgrade;



      (2)   Flexible base;



      (3)   Prime coat;



      (4)   Tack coat;



      (5)   Hot-mix asphaltic concrete pavement;



      (6)   Asphalt-treated base;



      (7)   Reinforced concrete; and



      (8)   Base reinforcement (Geogrids).



   (F)   Minimum layer thickness (compacted). If the following
components are utilized in proposed pavement sections, the minimum thickness
for the components shall be the following:



      (1)   Hot-mix asphaltic concrete pavement shall not be less
than one and one-half inches thick for surface course;



      (2)   Hot-mix asphaltic concrete pavement shall not be less
than two and one-half inches thick for a leveling-up course;



      (3)   Asphalt-treated base shall not be less than four inches
thick;



      (4)   Flexible base shall not be less than six inches thick;
and



      (5)   Lime treatment for subgrade shall not be less than six
inches thick.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.23.10)



§ 153.1075  SIDEWALKS.



   (A)   Applicability. Sidewalks are required on both sides of all
internal streets and the subdivision side of all adjacent or perimeter
streets, except as specified in subsection (B) below. Reverse frontage lots
shall have sidewalks provided on both street frontages.



   (B)   Sidewalk exceptions. The Planning Commission may waive all or
part of the sidewalk requirements in the following situations:



      (1)   When the Code Enforcement Officer determines that the
sidewalks will interfere with or disrupt drainage; and



      (2)   When the Code Enforcement Officer determines that public
construction that requires sidewalk replacement will take place on the street
within three years.



   (C)   Location. The field inspector may approve changes in the
sidewalk location for a maximum linear distance of 200 feet without amending
the street plan or utility layout provided if the plans are annotated with a
note stating that intent. During the plat review process, reviewing agencies
may designate areas where prior approval of the agency is necessary for any
alteration to the sidewalk location. No other changes are permitted without
the approval of all agencies that approved the original utility layout.



   (D)   Continuity. Sidewalks shall align vertically and horizontally
with abutting sidewalks. Sidewalks shall not be installed in such a manner
that they conflict with or are obstructed by power lines, telephone poles,
fire hydrants, traffic/street signs, mailboxes, trees, buildings, barriers,
light poles or any other structure. The grades of sidewalks shall not be such
that grades greater than 10% are encountered within blocks. When there is an
existing or anticipated obstruction, the sidewalk shall be installed around
the object and shall provide the required sidewalk width. When utility
layouts are required as part of a plat, the location and extent of sidewalks
within the subdivision shall be shown on the utility layout and shall be
subject to the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer and the utility
agencies.

§ 153.1076  ACCESS AND DRIVEWAYS.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all driveways. A lot
that is a part of an approved plat, which does not otherwise limit access,
which was approved by the city and filed for record as of the effective date
of this section, and which does not have sufficient frontage to meet the
driveway approach spacing requirements in this section, is allowed one
driveway approach.



   (B)   Single-family residential subdivisions.



      (1)   Lots occupied by single-family dwelling units shall not
front on a collector or arterial street except as provided in subsections
(B)(2) or (B)(3) below. Access points that permit vehicular access lots
subject to this subsection (B)(1) are prohibited.



      (2)   Subsection (B)(1) above does not apply if:



         (a)   The lot is at least one acre in size; and



         (b)   The lot includes a permanent vehicular turnaround
to prevent backing onto the collector or arterial street. This restriction
shall be noted on the plat.



      (3)   If conditions are such that vehicular access to such
lots cannot be provided other than from the collector or arterial street, the
Code Enforcement Officer may permit the creation of a marginal access street
or easement to serve two or more lots. The marginal access street or easement
shall be designed to permit entry to the thoroughfare without requiring a
motorist to execute a backing maneuver. Marginal access streets or easements
shall be included on the subdivision plat.







Figure 153.1076(A): Cross Access



   (C)   Non-residential, multi-family or mixed-use developments. Lots
in all other zoning districts, or lots that are not used for single-family or
duplex dwellings, are permitted vehicular access from a collector or
higher-order street subject to this section. The number of access points
shall not exceed one for every 200 feet of frontage.



   (D)   Cross access. All lots in commercial or mixed-use zoning
districts that front an arterial or collector street shall provide an access
connection to abutting parking areas that is at least 36 feet in width. The
applicant may grant a common access easement across the lot or recorded deed
covenant providing common access across the lot with adjacent lot or lots as
mitigation pursuant to Division 15 of this chapter. (See Figure 153.1076(A).)



   (E)   Location of access points. The location of access points shall
be based on the following criteria:



      (1)   The access point shall not conflict with vehicle turning
movements; and



      (2)   The access point shall be located at least 50 feet from
an intersection. On collector or higher-order streets in a commercial zoning
district, the driveway approaches shall be located by a distance of at least
90% of the frontage length, or 125 feet, whichever distance is less.



   (F)   Alignment.



      (1)   Access points shall align with opposing driveway
approaches, if any, or shall be offset by at least 25 feet. The Code
Enforcement Officer may waive this requirement if the applicant provides a
cross access as provided in subsection (D) above.



      (2)   Access points shall align with the existing median
opening. No cuts through the left turn reservoir of a median are permitted.



   (G)   Driveway throat or vehicle storage length. For purposes of
this section, THROAT LENGTH means the length extending from the entry into
the site to the first left turn conflict or intersection with a parking
aisle. VEHICLE STORAGE LENGTH means the length of a driveway, service lane,
bay or other passageway for motor vehicles that is designed to minimize
queuing onto surrounding streets. Throat length shall be designed in
accordance with the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting
vehicles to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on the
public street or causing unsafe conflicts with on-site circulation. Throat
length and vehicle storage length shall conform to Table 5-30 unless approved
by the Code Enforcement Officer. These measures apply to the principal access
to the property and not to driveways where access is restricted to one
driving lane or to loading or service entries.



   (H)   Parking approaches. Parking aisles shall be located a minimum
of 20 feet from the intersection of the driveway approach and the
thoroughfare.



   (I)   Driveway approaches. Driveway approach materials may be
asphalt, concrete or other materials as provided in the IDOT specifications.

   Gated streets are subject to the following and § 153.1073 of this
chapter.



   (A)   Pavement management. The applicant shall include with the HOA
documents a forecast and schedule of street maintenance costs prepared by a
professional engineer. A maintenance account with seed money shall be
established by the developer to enable the HOA to meet the maintenance
schedule until the HOA is self-sufficient. Any HOA requesting that the city
acquire their private streets shall produce documentation that the
maintenance schedule set forth in the HOA’s original pavement management
plan as part of the HOA documents has been followed.



   (B)   Fire lanes. The HOA documents shall require the HOAs to
identify and enforce a no-parking restriction in fire lanes throughout the
community.



   (C)   Master key security system. A master key security system shall
be provided on all gates. The security system shall include the following:



      (1)   A gate override in case of power failure; and



      (2)   A master key provided to the Fire Department, the School
District and the Police Department.



   (D)   Queuing. At gated entrances where traffic can queue into
public streets, the gates-and-entrances design must provide for sufficient
storage capacity such that no queuing vehicles will queue into the public
street. The entryway, including the paved surface area lying between the
street providing access to the subdivision and the gates, shall include a
turning radius of at least 40 feet.

§ 153.1078  TRAFFIC CALMING.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to local streets. Streets
exceeding 300 feet in length shall include an approved traffic calming
feature. The distance between traffic calming features shall not exceed the
block length standards established in §§ 153.0995 through 153.1003 of this
chapter.



   (B)   Traffic control calming features. The following provisions
describe and establish standards for permitted traffic calming devices where
traffic calming measures are permitted as part of the roadway design elements
in subsection (A) above. The descriptions below are described in the document
entitled Traffic Calming: State of the Practice. Traffic calming options for
local streets are noted in Table 153.1078(A) below.



   (C)   Maintenance. Maintenance of landscaping associated with
traffic calming features shall be the sole responsibility of the HOA.



 

Table 153.1078(A): Approved Traffic Control Devices and Description


Median islands: These are raised, circular landscaped areas located within
non-intersection, midblock locations. Median islands channelize traffic and
separate opposing flows. Traffic must slow down to maneuver around a median
island. Median islands offer landscaping opportunities and maintenance
responsibility. Median islands can be used to protect existing trees.


Neckdowns/flares/street narrowing/intersection throating: Neckdowns are curb
extensions at intersections that reduce roadway width curb to curb. They are
sometimes called slow points, nubs, bulbouts, knuckles or intersection
narrowing. These traffic control measures reduce the width of a section of
roadway in a gradual manner. They shorten crossing distances for pedestrians
and draw attention to pedestrians via raised peninsulas. By tightening curb
radii at the corner, the pedestrian crossing distance is reduced and the
speeds of turning vehicles are reduced. The effect of this measure is to
reduce speed and discourage non-local traffic. Motorists react to this
measure with slower speed because of a concern of a limited travel path.


Roundabouts/traffic circles: These are raised circular structures constructed
at a three-or four-way intersection. Their objectives are to slow speeding
and reduce the number and severity of vehicular accidents. This measure is
most suitable for wide intersections and may accommodate all sizes of
vehicles by applying appropriate engineering designs.


Speed humps: These are raised pavement features constructed across the width
of the street. The speed hump shall be 3 inches high and 12 feet long from
the leading edge to the trailing edge. This feature discourages motorists
from speeding and encourages them to obey the posted speed limit. When speed
humps are constructed, advisory signs shall be installed to notify motorists
of the speed hump and an appropriate advisory travel speed.


“T” intersections: These are located at grade intersections where one of
the intersecting street links is perpendicular to the other two. Traffic must
slow down to negotiate the turning maneuvers in a “T” intersection. This
roadway feature is very common. Motorists are familiar with T intersections.

153.1106(A) below.



   (B)   Expansion. When a building or parking lot is enlarged, the
requirements of this division apply on an incremental basis. This means that
landscaping is required in the same proportion that the enlarged building
area or off-street parking area has to the existing development (e.g., a 10%
increase requires 10% of the required landscaping).



   (C)   Exemptions. This section does not apply to the following
situations:



      (1)   Residential uses located within a residential zoning
district;



      (2)   Agricultural uses;



      (3)   The reconstruction of an existing building of which 50%
or less of the floor area was destroyed or ruined by flooding, fire, wind
storm or act of God. This exemption shall apply only where reconstruction of
that building will not result in an increase in building size or paving area
of the parking facilities to be provided;



      (4)   Interior finish work or remodeling in a portion of a
building unless the work results in an increase in the paving area of the
parking facilities within the street yard or in an enlargement of the
exterior dimensions of an existing building;



      (5)   Any use, building or structure for which only a change
of use is requested and which requires no structural modifications that
increase its volume or scale;

The permeable surface areas for shrubs may be included within permeable
surface areas required for trees.



   (D)   In satisfying the requirements of this section, the use of
four inches of organic mulch material shall be provided at the time of
planting.



   (E)   Each large tree, small tree or large shrub shall be planted at
least 30 inches from the edge of any paved surface.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.30.4)



§ 153.1110  PROTECTION OF PLANT AREAS.



   (A)   Generally. Plant areas must be protected from vehicular
traffic through the use of concrete curbs, wheel stops or other permanent
barriers.



   (B)   Maintenance.



      (1)   Required plants shall be maintained in a healthy
condition at all times. The property owner shall provide weeding, mowing of
grass, irrigation, fertilization, prevention of pests, pruning and other
maintenance of all plantings as needed. Any plant that dies shall be replaced
with another living plant that is comparable to the existing plant materials
or plant materials specified in the approved greenspace plan within 90 days
after notification by the city. The Code Enforcement Officer may extend this
time period up to an additional 90 days due to weather considerations.



      (2)   If the plants have not been replaced after appropriate
notification and/or extension, the property owner, or his or her designee or
leasee, shall be in violation of this chapter.



   (C)   Utility lines. Any damage to utility lines resulting from the
negligence of the property owner or his or her agents or employees in the
installation and maintenance of required landscaping in a utility easement is
the responsibility of the property owner. If a public utility disturbs plants
within a utility easement, it shall preserve the plants and return them to
their prior locations after the utility work. The property owner shall
replace all required plants that die.



   (D)   Irrigation. Landscaped areas shall be irrigated with a system
that is suitable for the type of plantings installed. Where an irrigation
system is required, the irrigation system shall comply with the requirements
of state landscape irrigation standards. No irrigation is required for a Type
N buffer if no additional planting is required. The Code Enforcement Officer
may waive the irrigation requirements if no additional planting is required
to meet this criteria.

STREETSCAPE LANDSCAPING



§ 153.1145  APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   Generally. In addition to developments subject to § 153.1106
of this chapter, the following are subject to the streetscape planting
standards:



      (1)   All developments with five or more parking spaces; and



      (2)   All developments requiring subdivision review.



   (B)   Exemptions.



      (1)   Streetscape planting standards do not apply to any
street classification unless street trees are required by the street
improvement standards (§§ 153.1065 through 153.1078 of this chapter).



      (2)   If existing site conditions and/or existing development
of the property render the planting of street trees impracticable, the
applicant may submit a waiver or modification request in accordance with §
153.0977 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.32.1)

   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to any street
classification that requires trees. (See § 153.1067 and Table 153.1067(A) of
this chapter).



   (B)   Planting materials.



      (1)   Where no existing or proposed overhead utility lines
exist, street trees shall be large trees. If existing or proposed overhead
utility lines exist along the right-of-way that are greater than 35 feet in
height, then the trees shall be medium trees. If existing or proposed
overhead utility lines exist along the right-of-way that are lower than 35
feet in height, then the trees shall be small trees.



      (2)   Preservation of existing trees to meet this requirement
is permissible and recommended. A 15-foot existing vegetation buffer along
the right-of-way line is required for this option. Waivers for spacing and
alignment may be given in order for existing trees to meet street tree
requirements.



   (C)   Location. The street trees shall be planted:



      (1)   Within a planting strip required by § 153.1067 of this
chapter; and



      (2)   A minimum of three feet from the BOC.



   (D)   Spacing.



      (1)   Large trees shall be planted at a minimum ratio of one
for every 50 feet.



      (2)   Medium trees or small trees shall be planted at a
minimum ratio of one for every 30 feet.



      (3)   The spacing requirements are measured as an average of
the street frontage along the particular street. In no instance shall the
distance between street trees exceed 100 feet on center. Street trees shall
be planted in an even, linear spacing. If shifts to the linear spacing not
exceeding ten feet are required due to the location of existing
infrastructure, development or required sight distance, these shifts may be
approved by the City Manager.

each of the three sizes of trees as required to create the minimum shade
coverage.



   (B)   The minimum shade coverage shall be determined in accordance
with the following formula:



      A x B = C



      where:



      A = percent of site requiring coverage (25%);



      B = square feet of parking lot area (10,000 square feet); and



      C = total number of square feet needed for shade.



      Example:



      0.20 x 10,000 = 2,000



      Large tree = 1,200 square feet of shade



      (2,000/1,200 square feet = 1 tree)



      Small tree = 550 square feet of shade (2,000/550 square feet = 3
trees)

§ 153.1237  PERMITTED USES AND ACTIVITIES IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS.



   Provided they are permitted within the applicable zoning district, the
uses permitted in Column (A) of Table 153.1239(B) of this chapter are
permitted within the applicable corridor zone as defined in Table 153.1239(A)
of this chapter. Such uses are restricted to the corridor zones indicated in
Columns (B), (C) and/or (D) of Table 153.1239(A) of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.40.3)



§ 153.1238  DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS.



   In lieu of the dimensional regulations generally applicable to the
zoning district, the standards in Table 153.1239(B) of this chapter shall
apply to each riparian corridor zone. These standards do not apply to public
greenways or necessary public utilities.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.40.4)



§ 153.1239  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN RIPARIAN BUFFERS.



   The following standards and criteria shall apply to any portion of a
development or, as appropriate, to any land disturbance, within the riparian
buffers.



   (A)   No storm water discharge is permitted directly off an
impervious surface into a stream channel.



   (B)   Streets and driveways shall be located, as much as
practicable, parallel to the flow of waters. Where a street, driveway or
utility line necessarily must cross a watercourse, such crossing shall be
located and designed to allow convenient access by wildlife through and
beyond such crossing, and shall be designed to safely convey flood waters to
the same extent as before construction of said crossings.



   (C)   Streets and bridges shall be spaced at an average interval of
at least 400 feet within the proposed development, and not closer than 200
feet from streets on contiguous property. This distance shall be measured
from the edge of the paved surface.



   (D)   Water supply, sanitary sewer and on-site waste disposal
systems shall be designed to:



      (1)   Prevent the infiltration of flood waters into the system;



      (2)   Prevent discharges from the system or systems into flood
waters; and



      (3)   Avoid impairment during flooding to minimize flood
damage. Finished floor elevations to be served by sanitary sewer shall be at
or above the rim elevation of the nearest upstream manhole cover. Sanitary
sewer manholes must be provided with locking, water-tight manhole covers, or
be elevated to a height sufficient to prevent submersion or infiltration by
flood waters. All sewer and sewer outfall lines shall use gravity flow to a
point outside the riparian buffers.



      (4)   Promote rain water capture, treatment and storage to
promote recycling and reuse of water, including use of vegetated swales, rain
gardens, rain barrels and cisterns, and permeable paving techniques.



   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, gas, air
conditioning and other service/utility facilities shall be designed and/or
located in order to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding during the base flood discharge.

STEEP SLOPES



§ 153.1250  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   This subdivision minimizes the grading and site disturbance of steep
slopes by restricting impervious surfaces and land disturbance in such areas
and by requiring special construction techniques in steeply sloped areas in
order to:



   (A)   Protect water bodies (streams and lakes) and wetlands from the
effects of erosion on water quality and water body integrity;



   (B)   Protect the plant and animal habitat of steep slopes from the
effects of land disturbance; and



   (C)   Preserve the natural beauty and economic value of hillsides.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.41)



§ 153.1251  APPLICABILITY.



   This subdivision applies to any subdivision plat or site plan
application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.41.1)



§ 153.1252  MEASUREMENT OF SLOPE.



   SLOPE means the ratio of elevation change to horizontal distance,
expressed as a percentage. Slope is computed by dividing the vertical
distance (“rise”) by the horizontal distance (“run”) and multiplying
the ratio by 100. For purposes of this section, a slope shall include only
those areas of a size 400 square feet or greater. Four different categories
of slopes are established in this section and described in Table 153.1253(A)
of this chapter. The construction and development restrictions are
established in Table 153.1253(A) of this chapter for each category of slope.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.41.2)



§ 153.1253  CONTENTS OF APPLICATION.



   (A)   The following information shall be provided for any
application proposing development on a lot or parcel that includes a slope of
at least 10%:



      (1)   A slope and topographic map based on a certified
boundary survey depicting contours at an interval of five feet or less. The
map shall indicate, through crosshatching or separate colors, all areas
within each slope category described in Table 153.1253(A) of this chapter.
Slope determinations shall be made upon areas with a size of 400 square feet
or greater in the categories described in Table 153.1253(A) of this chapter;



      (2)   An analysis of the direction, rate and volume of storm
water run-off leaving each area within a slope category described in Table
153.1253(A) of this chapter; and



      (3)   The location of any existing swales, streams or other
watercourses.



   (B)   The following information shall be provided for any
application proposing development on a lot or parcel that includes a slope
greater than 15%:



      (1)   A detailed site analysis of soil conditions;



      (2)   A detailed site analysis of hydrology;



      (3)   A detailed site analysis of bedrock conditions; and



      (4)   A detailed site analysis of any other engineering and
environmental considerations as may be required by the Code Enforcement
Officer in order to determine whether the proposed development will create a
threat to the public health, safety and general welfare or cause land
subsidence, erosion or increases in the rate of volume of storm water
entering adjoining properties.

      (5)   Surface and ground water quality and quantity
enhancement by removing sediment, nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollutants
from surface water;



      (6)   Habitats for fish and wildlife, including waterfowl and
rare or endangered species, thereby promoting habitat and species diversity;



      (7)   Ground water recharge, which can occur in wetlands and
which will assist in ensuring that ground water is available for the future;



      (8)   Outdoor recreation, including enhancement of scenic
waterways and recreational uses for hunting, fishing, hiking and the like,
which not only add to the quality of life but also have a significant
economic impact on the city, region and state; and



      (9)   Timber and food production in properly managed wetlands,
which can provide wood products, plants and animals for human and livestock
consumption.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.42)



§ 153.1266  APPLICABILITY.



   This subdivision applies to any subdivision plat or site plan
application.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.42.1)



§ 153.1267  GENERALLY.



   Applications for subdivision or site plan approval shall include a true
copy of any dredge or fill development approval requested or issued pursuant
to § 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, or
any other action requiring wetland mitigation. The applicant shall notify the
Code Enforcement Officer of any changes or conditions to the application that
are issued prior to final plat approval.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.42.2)



§ 153.1268  EXEMPTION.



   (A)   The Planning Commission may waive or reduce the wetlands
protection or mitigation requirements established in this section if it finds
that:



      (1)   The wetland area does not contribute to the public
benefits listed or the specific subsection



due to its size or the lack of hydrological connections to other water
resources;



      (2)   Strict compliance with this section denies the applicant
substantially all economic use of his or her property;



      (3)   Strict compliance with this section is inconsistent with
an adopted Comprehensive Plan policy; or



      (4)   The applicant has mitigated the impacts on any affected
wetlands on site through the purchase of wetland mitigation bank credits from
the state’s Department of Natural Resources.



   (B)   If the applicant receives an exemption pursuant to subsection
(A) above, the purchase, mitigation or restoration requirements of the
state’s Department of Natural Resources shall be included as a condition of
subdivision or site plan approval.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.42.3)



§ 153.1269  STANDARDS.



   (A)   Buffer. A minimum 30-foot buffer shall be established around
any wetland exceeding 3,000 square feet of contiguous wetland area.



   (B)   Encroachment. No impervious surface, road and utility line, or
water-dependent use (e.g., docks or bridges) may encroach into a wetland or
wetland buffer unless the Planning Commission finds the following prior to
approval that:



      (1)   The use or activity proposed and its attendant impacts
cannot be reasonably avoided;



      (2)   The least damaging route and methodology have been
selected and that which is being proposed is the best practicable alternative
available;



      (3)   Reasonable and acceptable impact mitigation measures
have been incorporated where necessary and appropriate to minimize wetland
loss or degradation;



      (4)   The overall impact of encroaching into wetland or buffer
areas is necessary for the productive use of adjoining buildable land, and
this impact outweighs the public benefits gained by preventing the
encroachment;



      (5)   No significant impact on the aquatic habitat of rare or
endangered species, as listed by the state or federal government, will
result; and



      (6)   Erosion and sedimentation control methods are
incorporated that will avoid any degradation in the water quality of the
affected wetland.

PARKING



§ 153.1295  MINIMUM STANDARDS.



   This subdivision sets minimum standards for off-street requirements for
new construction and expansion of or changes to existing uses. The purpose of
this section is to ensure that uses have a minimum level of off-street
parking to avoid congestion on surrounding streets while avoiding excessive
parking, discouraging pedestrian access, driving up the cost of development
and inviting excessive levels of traffic congestion, which creates increases
in flooding and non-point source pollution. On-street parking is also
encouraged in some locations in order to provide a buffer between pedestrians

§ 153.1296  PARKING RATIOS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   Applicability. The minimum parking ratio standards apply
to all zoning districts, except the “D” (Downtown) Zoning District. The
minimum parking ratios do not apply to the TND or TOD use patterns.



      (2)   Uses not identified. The Code Enforcement Officer shall
determine the parking requirement for uses that do not correspond to the
categories listed in Table 153.1296(A) below. In such instances, the
applicant shall provide adequate information by which the proposal can be
reviewed, which includes but may not necessarily be limited to the following:



         (a)   Type of uses;



         (b)   Number of employees;



         (c)   Building design capacity;



         (d)   Square feet of sales area and service area;



         (e)   Parking spaces proposed on site;



         (f)   Parking spaces provided elsewhere; and



         (g)   Hours of operation.



      (3)   Multiple uses. Where the application identifies
accessory or multiple uses within a structure or multiple structures, the
minimum standards shall apply to each use or structure. This does not apply
to § 153.1297 of this chapter.



      (4)   Fractional measurements. When units or measurements
determining the number of required off-street parking spaces result in a
fractional space, then such fraction equal or greater than one-half shall
require a full off-street parking space.



      (5)   Floor area measurement. Floor area and GFA are
synonymous for purposes of this chapter. (See “gross floor area”, as
defined in § 153.0008 of this chapter.)



      (6)   On-street parking. The minimum number of required
off-street parking spaces shall be reduced by the number of on-street parking
spaces abutting the property lines of the lot or parcel.



   (B)   Minimum parking ratios.Table 153.1296(A) below establishes the
minimum numbers of parking spaces required for the uses indicated. For the
purposes of parking calculations, the gross area of any parking garage within
a building shall not be included within the GFA of the building. Parking
requirements may be met by one or more of a combination of the following
methods.



      (1)   Providing on-site parking spaces. Only spaces that are
designed consistent with this section are counted toward the minimum parking
required. Spaces at gasoline pumps and bays for auto repair/service are not
counted toward the minimum parking required. No part of a parking or loading
space required for any building to comply with this chapter shall be included
as part of a parking or loading space required for another building.



      (2)   Making payments in lieu of parking spaces that shall be
contributed to a parking fund specifically set aside to provide public
parking within one-quarter mile of the exterior boundaries of the proposed
development. The amount of the payment for each space shall be established by
a resolution of the city and shall be reasonable and based on the actual or
estimated cost to provide such spaces. No development approvals shall be
issued until complete payment has been received by the city.



      (3)   Providing off-site parking spaces in a shared parking
facility. Shared parking facilities must conform to § 153.1297 of this
chapter.



   (C)   Maximum parking ratios.



      (1)   Table 153.1296(A) below indicates the maximum number of
parking spaces established for the use or structure. If a maximum parking
space ratio applies, the number of parking spaces shall not exceed the
maximum number permitted.



      (2)   The maximum spaces allowed do not include accessible
spaces required by the building code.

§ 153.1297  SHARED PARKING.



   (A)   Generally. Parking spaces required under this subdivision may
be provided cooperatively for two or more uses in a development or for two or
more individual uses, subject to the requirements of this section.



   (B)   Cooperative parking.



      (1)   Off-street parking requirements of a given use may be
met with off-site, off-street parking facilities of another use when, and if,
all of the following conditions are met:



         (a)   The off-site, off-street parking facilities are
within 300 feet of the property;



         (b)   The parking demands of the individual uses, as
determined by the administrator based upon minimum off-street parking
requirements, are such that the total parking demand of all the uses at any
one time is less than the total parking stalls required; and



         (c)   A written agreement between the owners and lessees
is executed for a minimum of 20 years, approved by the Code Enforcement
Officer as provided in subsection (B)(2) below. The application shall be
recorded and a copy maintained in the project file. Should the lease expire
or otherwise terminate, the use for which the off-site parking was provided
shall be considered non- conforming and any and all approvals, including
CUPs, shall be subject to revocation. Continuation or expansion of the use
shall be prohibited unless the use is brought into compliance with the
parking regulations of this subdivision.



      (2)   An application for approval of a cooperative parking
plan shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer by the owner of the
entire land area to be included within the cooperative parking plan, the
owner or owners of all structures then existing on such land area, and all
parties having a legal interest in such land area and structures. Sufficient
evidence to establish the status of applicants as owners of parties in
interest shall be provided. The application shall include plans showing the
location of the uses or structures for which off-street parking facilities
are required, the location of the off-street parking facilities and the
schedule of times used by those sharing parking in common; and



      (3)   Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same
limitations and requirements by which the cooperative parking plan was
approved and registered, any such plan may be amended or withdrawn, either
partially or completely, if all land and structures remaining under such plan
comply with all the conditions and limitations of the plan, and all land and
structures withdrawn from such plan comply with the regulations of this
subdivision.



   (C)   Shared parking. Developments that contain a mix of uses on the
same parcel, as set forth in Table 5-47, may reduce the amount of required
parking in accordance with the following methodology:



      (1)   Determine the minimum parking requirements in accordance
with Table 153.1297(A) below for each land use as if it were a separate use;



      (2)   Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages
for each of the five time periods set forth in Columns (B) through (F) of
Table 153.1297(A) below;



      (3)   Calculate the total for each time period; and



      (4)   Select the total with the highest value as the required
minimum number of parking spaces.

§ 153.1300  CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.



   Off-street parking facilities shall be constructed, maintained and
operated in accordance with the specifications described in subsections (A)
through (F) of this chapter.



   (A)   Pavement. Parking and loading service areas shall be paved
with asphalt, bituminous or concrete material to minimize nuisance from dust.
Parking and loading areas shall be graded and drained in order to dispose of
all surface water. All driveways and parking areas for such vehicles shall be
constructed with rock, gravel, concrete, brick, asphalt, turf block or other
surfaces of comparable durability.



   (B)   Drainage and surfacing. Areas shall be properly graded for
drainage; surfaced with concrete, asphaltic concrete or asphalt; and
maintained in good condition free of weeds, dust, trash and debris.



   (C)   Wheel guards. Boundary or perimeter areas shall be provided
with wheel guards, bumper guards or continuous curbing so located that no
part of parked vehicles will extend beyond the property line of the parking
area. One wheel stop shall be placed at the end of each parking space.



   (D)   Protective screen fencing. Areas shall be provided with
protective screen fencing so that occupants of adjacent structures are not
unreasonably disturbed by the movement of vehicles either during the day or
at night.



   (E)   Lighting. Facilities shall be arranged so that the source of
light is concealed from public view and from adjacent residential properties
and does not interfere with traffic.



   (F)   Pervious pavement. Vehicle parking spaces may exceed the
maximum number of spaces permitted if the additional spaces are designed as
pervious pavement. Pervious pavement shall comply with the following
conditions.



      (1)   Pervious pavement shall be located only on soils having
a permeability rating of moderate rapid to very rapid (see definition of
“permeability” in § 153.0008);



      (2)   Pervious pavement shall not be located in soils with an
apparent or perched high-water table or a depth to bedrock of less than ten
feet, as set forth in the county soil survey;



      (3)   Pervious pavement shall not be located on any slope
exceeding 10% over 20 feet; and



      (4)   The pervious pavement area shall be vacuum swept and
washed with a high-pressure hose at least four times per year.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.51.5)



§ 153.1301  BICYCLE PARKING.



   (A)   Generally. Bicycle parking spaces shall be required for all
non-residential uses and structures. One bicycle parking space shall be
required for each 30 parking spaces.



   (B)   Design. Bicycle spaces may be provided through spaces or
bicycle storage racks. Bicycle spaces shall be at least two feet six inches
in width and six feet in length, with a minimum overhead vertical clearance
of seven feet. Racks and other fixtures used to provide for non-residential
uses must be securely affixed to the ground and allow for the bicycle to be
locked and chained. The design of bicycle racks and fixtures shall be
included in final site plans and approved by the Public Works or
Transportation Department, and shall be separately marked.



   (C)   Location.



      (1)   Where bicycle spaces are required by subsection (A)
above, the spaces may be indoors or outdoors and shall be located within 50
feet of the primary entrance. The spaces shall not be located behind any
wall, shrubbery or other visual obstruction lying between the principal
building and the bicycle spaces. If required bicycle spaces are not visible
from the street, signs must be posted indicating their location.



      (2)   Areas used for required bicycle parking shall be paved,
drained and well lighted. Spaces within offices and commercial facilities or
located on balconies or within residential dwelling units shall not be
counted toward required parking.

LOADING



§ 153.1315  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Truck loading facilities are required in all zones other than
the “D” (Downtown) District for structures containing uses devoted to
businesses, industry, manufacturing, storage, warehousing, processing,
offices, professional buildings, hotels, multiple-family dwellings,
hospitals, airports, railroad terminals and any buildings of a commercial
nature.



   (B)   If a structure is enlarged, expanded or changed, it shall not
be used, occupied or operated unless it has at least the amount of off-street
truck loading facilities that would apply if the increment were a separate
structure.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.52.1)



§ 153.1316  RESPONSIBILITY.



   The provision for and maintenance of the off-street truck loading
facilities shall be the joint and several responsibility of the operator and
owner of the land upon which the structure requiring the facilities is
located.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.52.2)



§ 153.1317  TYPES AND LOCATION.



   There shall be two sizes of off-street truck loading spaces designated:
“large” and “small.” Each large space shall have an overhead
clearance of at least 14 feet, shall be at least 12 feet wide, and shall be
at least 50 feet long, exclusive of access or maneuvering area, platform, and
other appurtenances. Each small space shall have an overhead clearance of at
least 14 feet, shall be at least eight feet wide, and shall be at least 20
feet long, exclusive of access or maneuvering area, platform, and other
appurtenances.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 5.52.3; Ord. 3160, passed 1-9-2018)



§ 153.1318  LOCATION.



   Off-street truck loading facilities shall be located on the same lot on
which the structure for which they are provided is located. However, loading
facilities that are available under a cooperative arrangement (refer to §

DIVISION 15: ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES



§ 153.1335  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   An adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) ties
development approvals to the availability of infrastructure capacity measured
by adopted levels of service (LOSs) in the Comprehensive Plan or in the APFO.
An APFO accommodates anticipated growth by providing a rational system for
expanding improvements while ensuring that the level of growth does not
exceed a jurisdiction’s ability to accommodate it.



   (B)   An APFO differs markedly from exactions and impact fees. APFOs
are regulatory measures that are used to deny development applications or to
time and sequence development approval based on availability of
infrastructure on an adopted, funded and prioritized capital improvements
program (CIP). Impact fees and exactions are conditions for financing
off-site infrastructure attached to development approvals. APFOs provide the
opportunity to enhance certainty in the development approval process. With an
APFO, the applicant and the local government know the standards before
applications are filed. The APFOs provide the opportunity to structure
infrastructure mitigation requirements in a flexible manner. Providing cross
access easements, a higher degree of street connectivity and mixed uses can
be factored into the traffic impact analyses (TIAs) to reduce development
impact on the roadway network and thus create greater capacity.



   (C)   APFOs must be reasonable and flexible in order to work
efficiently. A “one-size-fits-all” LOS would have the unintended
consequence of encouraging sprawl because uncongested roads tend to lie at
greenfields at the periphery of the urbanized area. This situation is
remedied by providing a lower LOS, or an exemption, for:



      (1)   Downtowns and mature, built-up areas; or



      (2)   Where the infrastructure network is fixed, infill
opportunities and alternative transportation modes such as transit and
pedestrian access exist.



   (D)   An APFO raises numerous policy issues, which by themselves
could comprise a separate report. A summary of the issues is as follows.



      (1)   Adequate public facilities. These include water, sewer,
storm water management, police and fire protection solid waste, parks and
recreation, schools and transportation. Providers should include capital
improvement districts, utilities and local, regional, state or federal
jurisdictions. An APFO transportation LOS includes roads of the jurisdiction
and state and federal highway passing through or adjacent to the
jurisdiction. The same is true with an APFO based upon school facilities
located in a separate school district.



      (2)   Undesirable effects associated with timing or mitigating
new development proposals. These must be tempered or mitigated. Roads-based
APFOs could require an unacceptable widening of roads. These can be addressed
by designating the types of mitigation that will be accepted.



      (3)   Establishing LOSs. These must be established at levels
that protect public health, safety, and welfare while not unreasonably
restricting growth. Infill, corridors and downtown areas could be exempt from
the APFO in order to encourage development and to recognize the availability
of existing facilities.



      (4)   Development approvals. An APFO could be triggered at
early stages of the development approval process (plan amendments, rezoning
or discretionary decisions). This provides developers with knowledge of the
requirements of the APFO, allowing structuring of proposals before
significant expenditures have been committed to a project. APFOs can also be
triggered late in the development approval process. This approach more
efficiently uses staff and Planning Commission time because only those
projects that will proceed to development are reviewed. However, it may also
produce unanticipated delays in development after the applicant has committed
substantial resources to the project.



      (5)   Impact areas defining LOS. For water, sewer or piped
facilities, the impact area consists of the fixed service area. For
open-ended facilities, where demand is not physically restricted to a
geographic area, the designation is a policy decision (e.g., roads and
parks). An intersection or a park can be used by anyone inside or outside a
jurisdiction but demand typically declines with distance from the facility.
APFOs either provide a designated distance, a demarcation line (e.g., a
designated park or traffic influenced areas) or a procedure for evaluating
demand (e.g., evaluating all street links for which the development creates
at least 5% of the roadway impact). Some road ordinances require a TIA only
to the first intersection.



      (6)   Existing facilities. When determining whether adequate
capacity exists, we count both existing facilities and those included in the
CIP. Most programs count facilities within a third or fourth year of the CIP
for various reasons (e.g., it takes several years for many developments to
become fully occupied, thereby creating some lag time between development
approval and the demand for facilities; and counting only existing facilities
could unreasonably restrict growth).



      (7)   Reservation of capacity; pipeline development. When a
development is approved and gains vested rights, the amount of capacity it
utilizes must be debited against available capacity for future projects. This
pipeline development reservation of capacity must be strictly limited to two
to four years. Where an APFO is tested early in the process, the development
is still in the formative stages and could fail due to financing problems or
a changing market. In many communities, only a small percentage of rezoning
or preliminary plats actually proceed to construction. In this event,
approved projects should be counted toward available capacity only for a
three- to four-year window and not a permanent reservation of capacity.
Jurisdictions should implement a development approval tracking system.



      (8)   Application of APFOs. If the LOS is not met, development
of approval can either be denied or the development can be given the option
of timing and sequencing the project so that future stages of the proposal
are not approved until the facilities are available. Developers can also be
given the option to voluntarily advance capacity through a development
agreement if they wish to proceed at a faster pace. Constitutional
requirements of proportionality do not apply to voluntary development
agreements.

§ 153.1336  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES.



   This division shall be known and may be cited as the “Adequate Public
Facilities Ordinance” or “APFO”.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 6.1)



§ 153.1337  APPLICABILITY.



   This section applies to any application for development approval as set
forth in Column (B) of Table 153.1340(A). This section applies as a condition
to preliminary plat and site development plan approvals where no subdivision
is required. Development applications subject to this section shall be
accepted, approved, granted or issued only where the application provides
sufficient information to determine whether the capacity of public facilities
is adequate to support the proposed development. This section does not apply
to any use, development, project, structure, fence, sign or activity that
does not result in a new equivalent residential unit.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 6.2)



§ 153.1338  PROCEDURES FOR THE PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT
APPROVAL.



   (A)   Determination. After an application for development approval
is filed, the Code Enforcement Officer shall prepare a staff report along
with a recommendation to the approving agency. Upon receipt of the staff
report, the approving agency shall determine that:



      (1)   The application shall be approved where public
facilities and services are available at the adopted LOS;



      (2)   The application shall be denied where public facilities
and services are not available at the adopted LOS; or



      (3)   The application shall be approved subject to phasing of
development until all public facilities are available for the year the CIP
shows that facilities will be built and adequate if public facilities in the
impact area are not adequate to meet the adopted LOS for the entire proposed
development, consistent with the requirements of Table 153.1340(A) of this
chapter.



   (B)   Comprehensive plan and zoning amendments.



      (1)   Comprehensive plan or zoning amendments that may create
a range of potential impacts shall be reviewed as if the greatest impact
results.



      (2)   The review of adequacy of public facilities for the
application for a rezoning shall compare the capacity of public facilities to
the maximum projected demand that may result from the proposed rezoning based
upon the maximum density of the affected area pursuant to the amendment.



      (3)   Nothing in this section authorizes a development
approval that would otherwise be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 6.3)



§ 153.1339  DETERMINATION OF ADEQUACY OF PUBLIC FACILITIES.



   (A)   Scope. A determination of adequacy of public facilities for a
development proposal finds that:



      (1)   Public facilities are available at the time of issuance
of the determination; and



      (2)   Public facilities are deemed to be available at all
subsequent stages of the development approval process up to the date of
expiration of the development approval. Future availability of facilities
shall be assured through a development agreement between the applicant and
the city, in which case the public facilities will be considered to be
available for the duration of said development agreement.



   (B)   Duration. A determination that public facilities are adequate
is valid until the earlier of one of the following:



      (1)   The expiration of the development approval; or



      (2)   If no expiration period is provided in the development
approval, the determination expires unless construction commences within one
year after approval of the application. For a preliminary plat, the
determination expires unless construction commences on at least one lot
within two years after approval of the preliminary plat, and on at least 25%
of the lots within three years after approval of the preliminary plat.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 6.4)



§ 153.1340  ADVANCEMENT OF CAPACITY.



   (A)   Advancement of public facilities. In order to avoid undue
hardship, the applicant may propose to construct or to secure funding for the
public facilities necessary to provide capacity to accommodate the proposed
development at the adopted LOS and at the time that the impact of the
development will occur as an alternative to the deferral of development or
development approvals, consistent with the requirements of this chapter.

LOS = level of service;

CIP = capital improvements program; and

ISO = International Standards Organization.




 



   (B)   Standards. No advancement of capacity for public facilities
needed to avoid a deterioration in the adopted LOSs shall be accepted by the
approving agency unless:



      (1)   The proposed public facility is a prioritized and funded
capital improvement shown in the adopted CIP; or



      (2)   Appropriate conditions are included to ensure that the
applicant will obtain any necessary approvals for construction of the public
facilities from any agency other than the city.



   (C)   Construction commitment. The commitment for construction or
advancement of public facilities prior to the development approval shall be
included as a condition of the development approval. The commitment shall
contain, at a minimum, the following:



      (1)   For planned capital improvements, either a finding that
the planned capital improvement is included within the CIP for the year in
which construction of the project is scheduled or the applicant commits to
advancing the facilities;



      (2)   An estimate of the total financial resources needed to
construct or expand the proposed public facilities, and a description of the
incremental cost involved;



      (3)   A schedule for commencement and completion of
construction of the planned capital improvement with specific target dates
for multi-phase or large-scale capital improvements projects;



      (4)   A statement that the planned capital improvement is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the city’s CIP;



      (5)   A statement that the planned capital improvement is
consistent with any ordinances relating to the construction and design of the
public facility; and



      (6)   If the planned capital improvement proffered by the
applicant will provide capacity exceeding the demand generated by the
proposed development, but is needed to meet past deficiencies reflected in
the overall capacity needed for the project, reimbursement shall be offered
to the applicant for the pro rata cost of the excess capacity for the year in
which the capital facility would have been built as shown in the prioritized
CIP.



   (D)   Partial construction or funding. The construction or funding
of only a portion of a public facility needed to meet the adopted LOS shall
be approved only where:



      (1)   The public facility will be able to provide the capacity
needed to meet the adopted LOS, and will be fully usable and operational, due
to the characteristics of the facility; or



      (2)   The construction or funding of the balance of the public
facility that is needed to meet the adopted LOS will be accomplished from
other sources.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 6.5)



§ 153.1341  METHODOLOGY.



   (A)   Generally. No determination as to compliance with this section
shall be recommended by the Code Enforcement Officer or rendered by the
approving agency unless public facilities within the impact areas set forth
in Column (D) of Table 153.1340(A) of this chapter are:



      (1)   Adequate, as measured by the adopted LOS (refer to
Column (C) of Table 153.1340(A) of this chapter); and



      (2)   Available (refer to Column (E) of Table 153.1340(A) of
this chapter).



   (B)   Level of service standards. Compliance with LOS standards
shall be measured for each public facility set forth in Column (A) of Table
153.1340(A) of this chapter in accordance with the corresponding standards
set forth in Column (C) of Table 153.1340(A) of this chapter. The LOS for
each application for development approval shall be measured within the impact
area set forth in Column (D) of Table 153.1340(A) of this chapter for each
corresponding facility in Column (A). Column (E) of Table 153.1340(A) of this
chapter indicates whether planned capacity may be included in determining
whether the improvements are available. Rules for interpretation of Table
153.1340(A) of this chapter are in § 153.0008 of this chapter.



   (C)   Adequacy of public facilities. Public facilities shall be
adequate if it is demonstrated that they have available capacity to
accommodate the demand generated by the proposed development as well as
committed pipeline development approvals in accordance with the following
calculation methodology:



      (1)   Calculate total capacity by adding together the total
capacity of each public facility;



      (2)   Calculate net available capacity by subtracting from the
total capacity the sum of:



         (a)   The demand for each public facility created by
existing development;



         (b)   The demand for each public facility created by the
anticipated completion of committed pipeline development; and



         (c)   The demand for each public facility created by the
anticipated completion of the proposed development under consideration for
determination.



   (D)   Transportation analysis.



      (1)   Measurement. The procedure for calculating LOS is set
forth in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000. The impact of the proposed
development shall be measured by average daily trips and peak-hour trips
based upon the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation.



      (2)   Mitigation. The applicant may propose mitigation
measures, or a combination of measures, as described in this section, as an
alternative to denial of the application. These measures shall be included as
a condition for approval of the application. Mitigation measures may include:



         (a)   Phases so that no development approval is issued
before streets or other transportation facilities needed to achieve the LOS
standard are constructed;



         (b)   Measures that allow the transportation network to
function more efficiently by adding sufficient capacity to the off-site
street system. Such mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to,
pavement widening, turn lanes, median islands, access controls or traffic
signalization; and



         (c)   Transportation congestion management measures that
allow the transportation network to function more efficiently by adding
sufficient capacity to the off-site street system.



      (3)   Exemptions.



         (a)   The city finds and determines that downtown and
urban core built-up areas consist of:



            1.   Interconnected street systems, mixed uses and
the availability of pedestrian facilities that result in fewer trips than
conventional subdivisions;



            2.   Compact development patterns that produce
fewer and shorter trips than conventional developments; and



            3.   Established traffic patterns and
infrastructure within the urban core constitute a strong public policy to
exempt the downtown area built-up areas and adjacent urban core from APFO
requirements. The city further finds that there is a strong public policy to
encourage infill development and little opportunity to expand transportation
capacity in many infill areas without destroying the historic built
environment.



         (b)   Accordingly, the following are exempt from the
provisions of this section:



            1.   Applications for development approval within
the “D” (Downtown) District;



            2.   Any traditional neighborhood development
(TND) or transit-oriented development (TOD);



            3.   Infill development where public transit is
available within a one-fourth-mile distance, or broad-based retail commercial
is within walking distance; and



            4.   Mixed-use development with a 2:3 ratio of
jobs-housing balance.



   (E)   Fire, police and emergency services. Needed fire protection
flow shall be determined in accordance with the Insurance Services Office,
“Fire Suppression Rating Schedule” (June 1980 edition). In determining
the impact of the proposed development on fire, police and emergency service
LOS, the approving agency shall primarily take into consideration response
times, and the number and location of available apparatus and fire, police
and emergency service stations. For purposes of this section, the placement
of fire hydrants, the size of water lines and the distance between buildings
shall not be considered in determining the capacity of fire protection
improvements.



   (F)   Water.



      (1)   Development approval applications shall be analyzed with
respect to the availability of adequate potable water, and shall be
determined pursuant to the following information:



         (a)   System capacity;



         (b)   Capacity of wellfield, or other source of raw
water supply;



         (c)   Historical average flow of potable water;



         (d)   Historical peak flow of potable water;



         (e)   Number of hook-ups and the estimated potable water
demand per hook-up; and



         (f)   Number of hook-ups for which contractual
commitments have been made.



      (2)   The determination of the Code Enforcement Officer shall
provide substantial evidence that the project is within its service area and
that it has the capacity to serve the project as proposed. If the ability of
a provider to serve a proposed development is contingent upon planned
facility expansion in accordance with a CIP, details regarding such planned
improvements shall be submitted.



   (G)   Sewer.



      (1)   Applications shall be analyzed with respect to the
availability of adequate sanitary sewer capacity, and shall be determined
pursuant to the following information:



         (a)   System capacity;



         (b)   Historical average daily flow of treated sewage;



         (c)   Historical peak flow of treated sewage;



         (d)   Number of hook-ups and estimated sewer demand per
hook-up; and



         (e)   Number of hook-ups for which contractual
commitments have been made.



      (2)   The applicant shall provide documentation to the Code
Enforcement Officer indicating that the project meets the service area LOS
and has the capacity to serve the project. If the ability of a provider to
serve a proposed development is contingent upon planned facility expansion in
accordance with a CIP, details regarding such planned improvements shall be
submitted.



   (H)   Community parks. In determining compliance with the LOS
standard for community parks, an inventory of the number of community parks
shall be maintained in the CIP. The distance of a proposed development from a
community park shall not be considered for purposes of determining compliance
with the adopted LOS. The Code Compliance Officer shall forward the
application to the Kingsbury Park District for review and comments. The
approving agency shall consider the comments and recommendations of the
Kingsbury Park District, but shall retain ultimate discretion to determine
whether community parks are adequate for purposes of this section.

§ 153.1342  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   The CIP is the mechanism by which the city provides new
public facilities and expansion of the capacity of public facilities, which
are needed to accommodate existing and anticipated future population and
employment. Through the CIP, the city intends to use all reasonable means to
provide the public facilities and services needed to accommodate new growth
and development consistent with the availability of revenue sources, and
contributions for capital improvements provided by state or federal sources
or applicants, taking into account physical, environmental and topographical
constraints on the expansion of the capacity of public facilities.



      (2)   The CIP shall:



         (a)   Prioritize the need for public facilities subject
to this section;



         (b)   Estimate the cost of improvements for deficiencies
or repairs for which the city has fiscal responsibility;



         (c)   Analyze the fiscal capability of the city to
finance and construct improvements;



         (d)   Establish financial policies to provide for the
funding of improvements from grants, development exactions and impact fees,
dedications of land, taxes, assessments, rates and charges; and



         (e)   Schedule the funding, prioritization and
construction of improvements in a manner necessary to ensure that capital
improvements are provided when required based on needs identified in the
Comprehensive Plan.



   (B)   Capital improvements data requirements. The CIP shall be based
upon:



      (1)   Public facility needs as identified in the Comprehensive
Plan. Where the Comprehensive Plan does not identify a need for public
facilities within a given category, public facility needs shall be determined
on the basis of projected population and employment growth as set forth in
the Comprehensive Plan;



      (2)   The geographic service area and location of major system
components for each public facility shall be identified; and



      (3)   Existing revenue sources and funding mechanisms
available for capital improvements financing shall be inventoried for each
public facility.



   (C)   Capital improvements analysis requirements. The CIP shall be
based upon the following analyses:



      (1)   Current local practices that guide the timing, phasing,
priority and location of construction, extension or increases in capacity of
each public facility;



      (2)   The fiscal implications of existing deficiencies and
future needs for each type of public facility. This analysis shall be based
on the needed improvements, as identified by applying the LOS within each
impact area, and shall address the relative priority of need among facility
types;



      (3)   The costs of needed capital improvements for mitigation
of existing deficiencies, replacement and new growth needs;



      (4)   The basis of cost estimates; and



      (5)   An assessment of the service provider’s ability to
finance capital improvements based upon anticipated population and revenues,
including:



         (a)   Forecasting of revenues and expenditures for five
years;



         (b)   Projections of debt service obligations for
currently outstanding bond issues;



         (c)   Projection of ad valorem tax base, assessment
ratio and ad valorem tax rate;



         (d)   Projections of other tax bases and other revenue
sources, such as development agreement financing, dedications, impact fees
and service charges;



         (e)   Projection of operating cost considerations; and



         (f)   Projection of debt capacity.



   (D)   Requirements for capital improvements implementation. The CIP
shall contain:



      (1)   The five-year schedule of year-by-year capital
improvements that the city has accepted to reduce existing deficiencies, to
remain abreast of replacements and to meet future demand;



      (2)   Project description and general location; and



      (3)   A list of projected costs and revenue sources by type of
public facility for the five-year period. (See Table 153.1342(A) and Table
153.1342(B).)

DIVISION 16: SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS



Publisher's Note:This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. 3125,
adopted 3-14-2017). The text of the amendment will be incorporated below when
the amending legislation is codified.



§ 153.1355  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   This division establishes additional standards, exceptions to
standards or alternative standards (e.g., screening, landscaping and/or
design standards) for particular uses.



   (B)   The purpose of this division is to:



      (1)   Provide supplemental standards for individual uses in
order to protect surrounding property values and uses;



      (2)   Protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
and



      (3)   Implement the Comprehensive Plan. This division provides
supplemental regulations for certain uses, structures and facilities. These
regulations are in addition to the other applicable standards of this
chapter. In some cases, the establishment of these standards streamlines the
permitting process by permitting the use as of right in certain districts
subject to the supplemental regulations rather than a case-by-case
consideration for a conditional use permit (CUP). In other instances, the
supplemental regulations do not streamline the process but address the unique
development challenges of certain uses and structures whether permitted as of
right or as a conditional use.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7)



§ 153.1356  COMPLIANCE MANDATORY.



   No supplemental use may be initiated, established or maintained unless
it complies with the standards set forth for such use in this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7.1.1)



§ 153.1357  REGULATIONS SUPPLEMENT OTHER CODE REGULATIONS.



   The regulations of this division shall supplement the requirements of
the base applicable and overlay zoning district regulations and the other
applicable standards of this chapter. These standards are in addition to, and
do not replace, the other standards for development set forth in other
divisions of this chapter unless otherwise provided. To the extent that there
is a conflict between a standard in another division of this chapter and a
standard in this division, the standard in this division governs unless
otherwise indicated.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7.1.2)



§ 153.1358  ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Applicability.



      (1)   This section applies to any subordinate use of a
building or other structure, or use of land that is:



         (a)   Conducted on the same lot as the principal use to
which it is related; and



         (b)   Clearly incidental to, and customarily found in
connection with, the principal use or structure.



      (2)   Where a principal use or structure is permitted, such
use shall include accessory uses and structures subject to this section.



   (B)   Establishment.



      (1)   Accessory buildings or uses shall not be constructed or
established on a lot until construction of the principal structure is
completed or the principal use is established.



      (2)   In no instance shall an accessory building or use be
established on a vacant lot.



      (3)   Accessory buildings shall not be used for dwelling
purposes, except where permitted in the use matrix (§ 153.0202 and Table
153.0202(A) of this chapter).



   (C)   Dimensional and density standards.



      (1)   The location of accessory uses and structures is subject
to § 153.0996 of this chapter.



      (2)   For residential lots not exceeding two acres, detached
accessory buildings shall not be located in the front yard. Detached
accessory buildings may be located in the required rear yard.



      (3)   For residential lots exceeding two acres, detached
accessory buildings may be located in the front yard.



      (4)   The location of permitted, non-residential accessory
structures is governed by the same dimensional regulations as set forth for
the principal use or principal structure or structures.



      (5)   The maximum lot coverage of all accessory structures
shall not exceed 50% of the total area of the side and rear yards; provided
that, in residential districts, the total floor area does not exceed a
maximum of 2,500 square feet.



      (6)   Accessory uses and structures shall not exceed 60% of
the gross floor area (GFA) of the principal use.



      (7)   Within non-residential districts, accessory structures,
except for carports, are prohibited within the side and rear yards of lots
adjacent to a neighborhood district. The total floor area of all accessory
structures shall not exceed 2,500 square feet.



   (D)   General requirements.



      (1)   Accessory uses shall not include the conduct of trade
unless permitted in conjunction with a permitted use.



      (2)   Accessory uses shall be located on the same lot as the
principal use for which they serve.



   (E)   Height. Accessory buildings (see Table 153.1358(A) of this
chapter) shall not exceed:



      (1)   The height regulations of the applicable zoning
district; or



      (2)   Fifteen feet in height, where the accessory structure is
located within a yard.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7.2)



§ 153.1359  ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS.



   (A)   Purpose and findings.



      (1)   Affordable housing and neighborhood stability are
important public objectives in the city.



         (a)   In recent years, accessory dwellings have become
an important method to permit families to remain in their homes by securing
rental income, while at the same time providing affordable housing for the
elderly, single-person households, students and other types of households.



         (b)   Accessory dwellings are also known as “carriage
houses”, “granny flats” or “ECHO homes” (an acronym for “elder
cottage housing opportunities”).



      (2)   (a)   This section allows accessory dwelling units to
provide the opportunity to develop small dwellings designed, in particular,
to meet the special housing needs of single persons and couples of modest
income.



         (b)   This section allows and encourages the more
efficient use of the existing housing stock to preserve historic structures
and to provide an incentive for their maintenance.



         (c)   Design standards are established to ensure that
accessory dwelling units are located, designed, constructed, landscaped and
decorated in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the
appearance of the principal building remains as a single-family detached
dwelling.



         (d)   It is also the intent of these regulations to
assure that the single-family character of the property will be remains
subordinate to the primary living maintained and that the accessory dwelling
unit quarters.

   (B)   Accessory dwelling units in detached buildings.



      (1)   Applicability. This section applies to any accessory
dwelling unit that is located in a building that is not attached to the
principal dwelling. (See Figure 153.1359(A) below.)



      (2)   Number permitted. Only one accessory dwelling unit is
permitted per lot. An accessory dwelling unit shall not contain more than two
bedrooms.







Figure 153.1359(A): Accessory Dwelling Units



Providing housing opportunities for extended families living together is a
fundamental principle of traditional neighborhood development.



      (3)   Location. Separate detached garages and separate
accessory units are not permitted on the same lot. Accessory units may be
created as a second story within detached garages if the height of the
accessory unit and/or garage does not exceed the height of the principal
structure on the lot.



      (4)   Scale.



         (a)   The GFA of an accessory dwelling unit shall not
exceed 50% of the principal building’s floor area. The building footprint
of the accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed 40% of the building footprint
of the principal residence. The “building footprint” shall include
patios, but shall not include porches.



         (b)   The accessory dwelling shall not exceed 800 square
feet of GFA in the “NU” (Neighborhood Urban) or “NS” (Neighborhood
Suburban) Zoning Districts, or 1,200 square feet in the “RE” (Residential
Estate) Zoning District. This restriction applies only to that portion of a
structure that constitutes living area for an accessory dwelling.



      (5)   Building design.



         (a)   In order to maintain the architectural design,
style, appearance and character of the main building as a single-family
residence, the accessory dwelling unit shall have a roof pitch, siding and
window proportions identical to that of the principal dwelling.



         (b)   An accessory dwelling shall not exceed two stories
or the height of the principal dwelling unit, whichever is less.



         (c)   No exterior stairway to the second floor is
permitted at the front or side of the building.



      (6)   Occupancy.



         (a)   The total number of occupants in the accessory
dwelling unit shall comply with the occupancy standards of the Building Code.



         (b)   The property owner must occupy either the
principal dwelling or the accessory dwelling as the permanent residence. The
property owner shall not receive rent for the principal dwelling. For
purposes of this section, PROPERTY OWNER means the title holder and/ or
contract purchaser of the lot, and OWNER OCCUPANCY means that a property

§ 153.1360  AUTO-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.



   (A)   Purpose and findings.



      (1)   The “AOD” (Auto-Oriented District) permits a number
of lawful uses that are inherently dependent on automobile access.



         (a)   Typical lot layouts include large front parking or
vehicular storage areas, gasoline canopies and buildings or lot layouts that
are inconsistent with the scale of a neighborhood or a traditional
neighborhood.



         (b)   Use and building forms in this district have few
precedents for compact or pedestrian-friendly site layout.



         (c)   However, these types of building forms have
occupied the corner of many corridors in the city, creating an auto-dependent
building form.



      (2)   It is the intent of this district to accommodate these
building forms with site layouts that reflect market-driven design practices.
It is also recognized that these uses, properly located and in proper
amounts, fulfill the public and market needs for automobiles, automobile
maintenance and services that depend on automobile access. However, it is the
city’s desire to control the amount, spacing and design of such uses
through the rezoning process.



      (3)   This section establishes city policies for controlling
the location of these uses, and development standards to provide for
vehicular circulation and better design practices. These standards encourage
such development to occur along major transportation arteries where sites are
adequate for an integrated design of automotive services and where such
development most adequately serves the needs of the community’s residents
without creating excessive strip development.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   This section applies to any lot or parcel designated as
“AOD” (Auto-Oriented District) on the zoning map.



      (2)   The “AOD” includes permissions, standards and
requirements in addition to those contained in the underlying zoning district.



      (3)   This section affects the “AOD” Overlay Zoning
District only.



      (4)   Issues not specifically addressed in this “AOD”
Overlay Zoning District are governed by the remaining provisions of this
chapter. (See Figure 153.1360(A) below.)

The gas station pump canopy matches the style of the principal building.



   (C)   Permitted uses. The uses described in Table 153.1360(A) below
are permitted as of right in an “AOD”.



   (D)   General standards. As part of an application for a rezoning to
an “AOD” (Auto-Oriented District), the applicant may submit a development
agreement for approval by the city. The development agreement may include the
following in addition to the requirements of Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this
chapter:



      (1)   Building design and architectural standards consistent
with the regulations established in subsection (E) below;



      (2)   The location, width, planting materials and planting
density for proposed landscaping;



      (3)   The location and dimensions of parking areas, storage
areas, gasoline pump islands and drive-through lanes; and



      (4)   Any restriction on uses, lot design and building scale
otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district and this district.

   (C)   Development approvals and orders.



      (1)   Other required development approvals.



         (a)   Generally. Excavation activities include a broad
range of land disturbance activities, which may require a grading development
approval and may require other local, state and federal development
approvals. It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to secure any
development approvals required by other governmental entities for the
proposed use. The city may, at its sole discretion, require that the
applicant obtain all other required development approvals prior to applying
for the required CUP and to require the applicant to submit evidence of such
other development approvals to the city as part of the CUP application.



         (b)   Subdivision plats. Applicants are not required to
apply for subdivision approval for “excavation activities” located on a
single parcel of land unless the activity constitutes a subdivision or
platting of two or more parcels.



      (2)   “EU” (Extractive Use) Overlay Zoning District. All
excavation activities defined as quarry excavation or sand or gravel
excavation pursuant to subsection (B) above shall apply for and obtain a
zoning amendment to an “EU” (Extractive Use) Zoning District. All
development in the “EU” Zoning District is subject to the standards and
procedures established in this section. The standards and procedures of this
section constitute the standards for development in the “EU” District.



      (3)   Conditional use permit. All excavation activities, as
defined in this section, shall be considered “conditional uses” in all of
the zoning districts in which they are listed, and requests for approval of
such activities shall be processed pursuant to §§ 153.0700 through 153.0709
of this chapter.



      (4)   Required plans and information. An application for
rezoning to an “EU” (Extractive Use) District and a CUP shall include a
complete application for a land alteration development approval. (See §
153.1647 of this chapter.)



      (5)   Project site expansion or modification.



         (a)   Changes to the CUP for the “excavation
activity” on the site shall be applied for and reviewed in accordance with
§§ 153.0700 through 153.0709 of this chapter.



         (b)   Changes other than changes to the phasing plan
shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the process by which the
original CUP was approved.



         (c)   An expansion of the site on which an “excavation
activity” has previously been approved will require a complete review of
the proposed new (expanded) site, as if an original application was being
made, as well as a review of the relationship and coordination of activities
between the original site and the expanded portion of the site. Of principal
concern during this review shall be the additional and cumulative impacts
that will be caused by the combined operations on factors such as the
environment, traffic, safety, noise, air pollution, neighborhoods and
adjacent land uses.



         (d)   Contraction of the site on which the “excavation
activity” has been approved will require a review in order to:



            1.   Evaluate how the loss of a portion of the
site will affect buffers, land-use compatibility, noise, reclamation and
reuse of the site and related factors; and



            2.   Determine what will be done on the excised
portion of the site (e.g., if another land use is proposed, a complete,
original review may be required).



      (6)   Transfer of development approvals.



         (a)   No transfer of a CUP by the original applicant to
another party nor a transfer of any other development approval issued by the
city that was necessary to authorize or allow the “excavation activity”
shall be permitted unless the city is notified at least 90 days prior to such
transfer and has an opportunity to assure that:



            1.   All conditions, standards and requirements
imposed on the original applicant will continue to be met; and



            2.   All security instruments remain in full
effect and, if also transferred, the new CUP holder agrees to comply in full
and has the necessary financial security to hold the city harmless.



         (b)   If the subject property is sold, the CUP and all
of the conditions, standards and requirements run with the land, and the new
property owner is fully bound as if he or she were the original owner.



         (c)   When an operator succeeds to the interest of
another on an uncompleted site, the Code Enforcement Officer shall release
the first operator of the responsibilities imposed by the development
approval only if:



            1.   Both operators are in full compliance with
the requirements and standards of this chapter and all development approvals;



            2.   The new operator assumes all responsibilities
of the former operator, including operations, maintenance and reclamation,
and provides a written, witnessed, notarized document asserting, inter alia,
that reclamation of the entire site will be completed as planned; and



            3.   The new operator provides the city with all
appropriate financial assurances, approved by the City Attorney, to ensure
completion of the project.



      (7)   Extension of development approval.



         (a)   Requests for CUP extensions must be submitted in
writing to the Planning Department at least three months prior to the
expiration date of the existing development approval.



         (b)   The city may grant a CUP extension for not more
than one-half the duration of the original CUP approval.



         (c)   No development approval extension shall be granted
unless the project is in full compliance with the terms of the existing
development approval or a compliance plan and schedule have been submitted
and approved by the city. If there have been any notices of default issued by
the city, these shall be reviewed and may be taken into consideration by the
city on the extension request.



         (d)   A CUP extension may include conditions to address
conflicts with adjacent properties or other circumstances unforeseen at the
time of original development approval.



         (e)   The extension of the CUP shall not be unreasonably
denied; provided that, the conditional use permittee has complied with all of
the conditions of the CUP and the standards and requirements for
“excavation activities” and has not been issued a notice of default nor
cited for a violation of the city code or state or federal regulations.



      (8)   Required findings. The city shall approve an overlay
zoning district or a CUP authorizing an excavation activity only if all of
the following findings with respect to the proposed activity are made:



         (a)   The activity will not result in a danger to life
or property due to:



            1.   Steep or unstable slopes;



            2.   Unsafe access to the property;

            4.   Proximity to existing or planned residential
areas, parks and roadways.



         (b)   Visual, noise, dust and/or excessive on-or
off-site environmental impacts on public parks, roadways and residential
areas can be adequately mitigated by the applicant and a fully detailed plan
is submitted by the applicant to demonstrate the mitigation methods to be
used, the cost of such mitigation, the source of funds for such mitigation
and adequate legal assurance that all such mitigation activities are carried
out;



         (c)   The use of trucks and heavy equipment will not
adversely impact the safety and maintenance or cause excessive congestion of
public roads providing access to the site, or such impacts will be mitigated;



         (d)   The proposed use will not adversely affect air
quality or ground water or surface water quality;



         (e)   The proposed use will not adversely affect scenic
quality or natural landscapes, environment, wildlife and wildlife habitat or,
if such effects are anticipated to occur, the reclamation plan provides for
adequate restoration of the site following completion of the excavation
activity;



         (f)   The activity will be compatible with existing
development and development anticipated in the future, including other uses
as shown in the Comprehensive Plan, including, but not limited to, patterns
of land use, recreational uses, existing or planned development, public
facilities, open space resources and other natural resources;



         (g)   The activity will not unduly affect buffers and
screening year-round from unsightly features of the excavation operation;



         (h)   The activity will not result in the disturbance of
a natural community;



         (i)   The reclamation plan provides adequate and
appropriate restoration and stabilization of cut-and-fill areas;

wetlands and other natural features affecting ground water or surface water
quality;



         (l)   The intensity and anticipated duration of the
proposed excavation activity is appropriate for the size and location of the
activity;



         (m)   Permanent and interim erosion and sediment control
plans have been approved by the city;



         (n)   Surety has been provided that guarantees the site
will be fully restored, after completion of the excavating activity, to a
safe condition, and one that permits reuse of the site in a manner compatible
with the Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood plans, specific plans and
applicable city policies; and



         (o)   A schedule of appropriate tipping and host fees
has been established and included in the development order approving the CUP.



   (D)   Separation distances.



      (1)   Generally. Required minimum distance of specific on-site
activities for quarries, sand or gravel excavation (when the proposed
activity will exceed 24 months) or substantial land alteration (when the
proposed activity will exceed 24 months) from adjacent property zoned
residential, commercial and industrial shall be as shown in Column (A) of
Table 153.1362(A) above. In lieu of Column (A) of Table 153.1362(A) above, a

shall be controlled by a plan submitted to the city by the applicant and
approved by the City Engineer, pursuant hereto. The plan shall address the
compatibility of the proposed use with any adopted city drainage or storm
water plans applicable to the area.



         (e)   The applicant shall provide signs on the property
and along haul routes where deemed necessary to promote the safety and
general welfare of the neighborhood and general area. Required signs may
include, but shall not be limited to, “No Trespassing”, “Trucks
Hauling”, “Blasting” and “Danger”. Other signs may be required if
necessary.



         (f)   Operations shall maintain compliance with local
and state standards for noise, dust and vibration. All equipment and
machinery shall be operated and maintained in such a manner as to minimize
dust, noise and vibration. Access roads shall be maintained in a dust-free
condition by surfacing or other treatment on a regular basis as may be
specified by the City Engineer. A water truck for the purposes dust control
may be required on site.



         (g)   Adequate dust control methods shall be
implemented. Roadways adjacent to the property shall be swept and cleaned on
a regular basis and when directed by the City Engineer as being necessary.



         (h)   A performance bond or other financial security in
an amount satisfactory to the City Engineer, and in a form approved by the
City Attorney, shall be secured from the applicant to ensure that all
standards are fully met during operation and to ensure that proper
reclamation of the site is completed in a timely manner.



         (i)   A six-foot continuous security fence shall be
provided around the entire perimeter of the property on which the quarrying
activity will take place. Additional fencing requirements may be imposed on
portions of the site abutting residentially zoned or planned areas, parks,
playgrounds, sidewalks, trails, schools, churches and other public facilities
and gathering places.



         (j)   Where a stockpile is visible from an arterial
roadway or residential district, the height of a stockpile may be limited by
the reviewing agency to the lowest height that is economically feasible on
the site. In no case shall the height of a stockpile exceed 50 feet for
permanent stockpiles and 75 feet for temporary stockpiles unless the
reviewing agency finds that the stockpile would not be visible from an
arterial roadway or residential district.



         (k)   Any lighting or signage, other than security
signage, on the property shall meet the standards for the zoning district in
which the activity is located.

residential zones, only free-form and natural-form water bodies will be
allowed. All water bodies shall include variation in shoreline and depth and
shall include curvilinear shorelines; and



         (b)   Where practical, the minimum size of water bodies
fed by ground water and not connected to streams shall be five acres with a
minimum average depth of 24 to 30 feet. Shallow water bodies may be
considered where the applicant can provide evidence that such water body will
not result in poor water quality and that it will not result in a nuisance to
the area.



      (6)   Slope. For sand and gravel excavation:



         (a)   No site shall exceed three feet horizontal to one
foot vertical incline over a distance of 30 feet. This angle of repose shall
be modified to a flatter angle, but not a steeper angle, if it is shown that
the site will be unstable at a 3:1 ratio or that vegetation cannot be
established on the 3:1 slope. This provision may be waived or modified by the
reviewing agency upon the recommendation of the City Engineer.



         (b)   For all locations where water bodies are created,
the slope of the bottom of the lake from water’s edge shall not exceed 4:1
for a distance of 20 feet from the water’s edge and shall not exceed a
depth of ten feet beyond that point for a distance of 20 feet. The slope

to arrange plant material to best suit the ultimate proposed use and design
of the property; provided that:



         (a)   At least eight deciduous and eight evergreen trees
from the city’s approved plant list are planted for each disturbed acre; and



         (b)   At least 25% of required trees are planted within
30 feet of the perimeter of the site.



      (8)   Cleanup and maintenance.



         (a)   All equipment, stockpiles, debris, signs, silt
fences and other erosion control structures shall be removed from the site
after completion of the activity.



         (b)   Adjacent roadways shall be swept and cleared of
loose or foreign materials resulting from the reclamation operation.



         (c)   A permanent six-foot security fence shall be
provided along the perimeter of the entire site to protect adjacent
residentially zoned or planned areas, parks, playgrounds, sidewalks, trails,
schools, churches and other public facilities and gathering places.



      (9)   Final reclamation. Final reclamation of each phase of
the operation shall be completed within six months of completion of each
phase of the operation. Extensions may be granted by the Code Enforcement
Officer not exceeding six months. No development approvals shall be issued on
the property prior to completion of reclamation of the site.

shall be specified.



         (b)   The owner shall submit all necessary documentation
for such proposed uses, including, but not limited to, a site plan, an
application for rezoning, an application for a development approval or other
required documentation necessary for development approval of the proposed use
on the reclaimed site.



   (I)   Financial assurances.



      (1)   Financial assurances shall be required in an amount as
determined by the City Engineer, but in no event to be less than $10,000, and
in a form approved by the City Attorney and the finance director, prior to
commencement of any substantial land alteration, quarry or sand or gravel
excavation activity.



      (2)   Financial assurances may be in the form of surety bonds,
irrevocable letters of credit or cash bonds. Other alternatives providing
adequate assurance may be considered by the City Attorney and the Finance
Director and, if approved by them, may be recommended to the city.



      (3)   Failure to stabilize the site, failure to make necessary
corrections and improvements to roadways caused by the excavation activity,
failure to reclaim the property as specified in the approved reclamation plan
and other inconsistencies between the approved operations and reclamation
plans and actual activities shall, at the discretion of the city, be cause
for the city to redeem the financial assurance to make the necessary
corrections.



   (J)   Inspection and monitoring.



      (1)   Annual inspection and report.



         (a)   At the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer,

make “spot” inspections at any time during the year, and multiple times
as may be deemed appropriate utilizing the compliance checklist, and shall
report such findings to the appropriate city officials.



         (d)   The Code Enforcement Officer may prepare a
“project compliance sheet” for each quarry, sand or gravel excavation,
and substantial land alteration activity as defined herein, and may compile
the individual “project compliance sheet” into an annual report for
presentation to the City Administrator.



      (2)   Monitoring.



         (a)   At the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer,
the city may, in addition to site inspections, monitor the issuance of the
development approvals for the above-described “excavation activities” on
a broader level, considering such issues as:



            1.   The concentration of such activities and the
effect of such concentration on particular neighborhoods and areas of the
city;



            2.   The effect of such activities on the
transportation system and the provision of other required public facilities
and services;



            3.   The effect of numerous “excavation
activities” on air and water quality and the environment;



            4.   The effect of such activities on the land
values of adjacent and nearby properties;



            5.   The extra expenses incurred by the city
relative to the operation and/or reclamation of such activities;



            6.   The actual usability of the sites after
reclamation;



            7.   The average duration of “excavation
activities”; and



            8.   The average time it takes to fully reclaim a
site and make it available for an alternative use.



         (b)   Based on the information collected, the City
Manager may prepare an annual monitoring report for review by the Code
Enforcement Officer and, at the Code Enforcement Officer’s discretion, by
the Board of Adjustment.

§ 153.1363  GROUP HOMES.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. This section is designed to protect the
rights of handicapped and disabled persons subject to the Federal Fair
Housing Act (FHA) and to accommodate housing for persons protected by the FHA
by establishing uniform and reasonable standards for the siting of group
homes and criteria that protect the character of existing neighborhoods.



   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to all group homes. For
purposes of this section, a GROUP HOME means a residential facility in which
more than eight handicapped persons unrelated by blood, marriage, adoption or
guardianship reside with one or more resident counselors or other staff
persons. A HANDICAPPED PERSON means a person with a significant temporary or
permanent physical, emotional or mental disability, including, but not
limited to, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, hearing and
sight impairments, emotional disturbances and orthopedic impairments, but not
including mentally ill persons.



   (C)   Fair Housing Act protections. The Code Enforcement Officer may
render an interpretation that any other facility, which is protected by the
federal FHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., but not expressly enumerated in
subsection (B) above, is subject to the protections provided by this section.
The Code Enforcement Officer may waive any provision of this section upon
determination that the waiver is necessary to afford handicapped persons
equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.



   (D)   Location. Group homes are permitted as of right in all
residential zoning districts, all commercial zoning districts, and other
zones as specified in the UDC. Pursuant to the requirements of the federal
FHA and applicable case law, the UDC does not require CUPs or any other form
of discretionary development approval for group homes. A variance is required
to the extent that the group home seeks a variance from the standards that
apply to other uses in the base zoning district.



   (E)   Standards. The standards applicable to group homes are the
same as for single-family dwelling units located within the ase district.
Evidence of any license, certification or registration required for the group
home by a state or federal agency, or a copy of all materials submitted for
an application for any such license, shall be provided.

occupations as an accessory use in a dwelling unit, whether owner- or
renter-occupied;



         (c)   Ensures that such home occupations are compatible
with, and do not have a deleterious effect on, adjacent and nearby
residential properties and uses;



         (d)   Ensures that public and private services, such as
streets, sewers or water or utility systems, are not burdened by the home
occupation to the extent that usage exceeds that normally associated with
residential use;



         (e)   Allows residents of the community to use their
residences as places to enhance or fulfill personal economic goals, under
certain specified standards, conditions and criteria;



         (f)   Enables the fair and consistent enforcement of

or business activity customarily conducted entirely within a dwelling unit
and carried on by a member of the family residing in the dwelling unit, and
which occupation or profession is clearly incidental and subordinate to the
use of the dwelling unit for dwelling purposes and does not change the
character of the dwelling unit. A home occupation is an accessory use to a
dwelling unit.



         (b)   No home occupation, except as otherwise provided
in this section, may be initiated, established or maintained in the unit
except in conformance with the regulations and performance standards set
forth in this section. A home occupation shall be incidental and secondary to
the use of a dwelling unit for residential purposes.



      (3)   Exempt home occupations. The activities listed in
subsections (A)(3)(a) through (A)(3)(d) below are not subject to this
section, provided that all persons engaged in such activities reside on the

      (1)   Provide affordable shelter for all residents of the city;



      (2)   Address housing needs;



      (3)   Promote a full range of housing choices; and



      (4)   Encourage the construction and continued existence of
very low- to low-income housing by providing for optional increases in
density in order to reduce land costs for such affordable housing.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   Generally. This section applies to any application for
development approval, as set forth in subsection (B)(2) below, which include
affordable dwelling units with the maximum ratio specified in Column (B) of
Table 153.1366(A) below. For purposes of this section, an AFFORDABLE DWELLING
UNIT means any dwelling unit required to provide only low-income or very
low-income housing.



      (2)   Qualifying applications. The provisions of this section
apply to a site, or a portion of a site, which is the subject of an
application for a development approval.



   (C)   Architectural design and character. Affordable dwelling units
shall comply with the residential urban design criteria of § 153.0999 of
this chapter.



   (D)   Density bonus and set-aside requirements.



      (1)   A qualifying application (as defined in subsection (B)
above) may be approved with an increase in the density of the site as set
forth in Table 153.1366(A) below. The applicant shall consent to a voluntary
and enforceable condition in which the specified percentage of the
developable density of the site, as specified in Column (B) of Table
153.1366(A) below, is reserved as affordable dwelling units.



      (2)   Table 153.1366(A) below shall be construed as follows:



         (a)   Determine the category of housing as set forth in
Column (A) of 153.1366(A) below;



         (b)   Determine the required set-aside for the
application category by referring to Column (B) of Table 153.1366(A) below.
For purposes of this subsection, the number of required affordable dwelling
units is determined by multiplying the total number of dwelling units
permissible on the site as set forth in Table 153.1366(A) below by the
percentage prescribed in Column (B) of Table 153.1366(A) below.



         (c)   Determine the density increase that may be awarded
by referring to Column (C) in Table 153.1366(A) below. For purposes of this
subsection, the additional density that may be awarded is determined by
multiplying the total number of dwelling units permissible for the site as
set forth in Table 153.1366(A) below by the percentage prescribed in Column

unless the applicant consents to a condition that development approvals for
non-affordable dwelling units (hereinafter “market rate units”) shall be
issued as follows.



      (1)   Development approvals may be issued for the first 50% of
the market rate units prior to the construction and offering for sale or
rental of any affordable dwelling unit.



      (2)   No development approvals may be issued for the next 25%
of the market rate units (i.e., from 51% up to 75% of the approved market
rate units) prior to the construction and offering for sale or rental of at
least 25% of the approved affordable dwelling units.



      (3)   No development approvals may be issued for the next 15%
of the market rate units (i.e., from 76% up to 90% of the approved market
rate units) prior to the construction and offering for sale or rental of at
least 75% of the approved affordable dwelling units.



      (4)   No development approvals may be issued for the remainder
of the market rate units (i.e., from 91% to 100% of the approved market rate
units) prior to the construction and offering for sale or rental of 100% of
the approved affordable dwelling units.



   (F)   Enforcement. The city or its designee may enforce compliance
with the standards of this section and may impose penalties for
non-compliance as set forth in § 153.9999 of this chapter.

city shall be established by the City Manager initially and shall be adjusted
semi-annually, based on a determination of all ordinary, necessary and
reasonable costs required to construct the prototype affordable dwelling
units by private industry, and other information, including the area’s
current general market and economic condition. Sales prices may not include
the cost of land, on-site sales commissions and marketing expenses, but may
include, among other costs, builder-paid permanent mortgage placement costs
and buy-down fees and closing costs, except for prepaid expenses required at
settlement.



      (4)   Affordable dwelling unit rental prices shall be
established by the City Manager initially and shall be adjusted
semi-annually, based on a determination of all ordinary, necessary and
reasonable costs required to construct and market the required number of
affordable dwelling rental units by private industry in the area, and other
information, such as the area’s current general market and economic
conditions.



      (5)   Prices for re-sales and re-rentals shall be controlled
by the City Manager for a period of 50 years after the initial sale or rental
transaction for each affordable dwelling unit.



      (6)   The sales or re-sales price for an affordable dwelling
unit shall be established, taking into consideration as one factor alleged
economic loss sustained by the owner as a result of providing the required
affordable dwelling units. “Economic loss” for sales units results when
the owner fails to recoup the cost of construction and certain allowances as
may be determined by the City Manager for the affordable dwelling units,
exclusive of the cost of land acquisition and costs voluntarily incurred but
not authorized by this section.

§ 153.1370  OUTDOOR DISPLAY AREAS.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to the display of retail
goods in parking areas, sidewalks and other locations outside of an enclosed
building. This section does not apply to farmers’ markets or produce stands
where permitted by the applicable zoning district.



   (B)   Permitted.



      (1)   Outdoor display of retail goods, wares and merchandise
are permitted accessory uses in the “CG” (Commercial General) and
“CL” (Commercial Large-Scale) Districts if expressly permitted pursuant
to a site plan. No such outdoor display is permitted unless the site plan
shows the location, area and boundaries of the outdoor display.



      (2)   Retail goods may be displayed on public or private
sidewalks in the “CN” (Commercial Neighborhood) and “D” (Downtown)
Zoning Districts, on any lot that abuts a TND main street or in the TOD, or
on any designated “A” street, where:



         (a)   The goods are located entirely under an awning or
canopy that complies with the city’s code of ordinances. If no awning or
canopy is present, the goods may be displayed on an area abutting and not
more than three feet from the storefront; and



         (b)   The display shall conform to the city’s streets
and right-of-way management ordinances.



      (3)   Such outdoor display must be customarily incidental to a
principal use in the district in which the outdoor display is permitted. Only
the business or entity occupying the principal use or structure shall sell
merchandise in the outdoor display areas.



      (4)   Such outdoor display is permitted in any yard, subject
to a minimum setback of 20 feet from an adjoining property line.



      (5)   Outdoor display shall be screened from view along any
property line abutting a residential zoning district by a minimum Type C
buffer that conforms to § 153.1122 of this chapter. To the extent that
buildings on the premises are located in order to screen views from adjacent
streets and properties, such buildings may be considered to be part of the
required screening in lieu of landscaping, fences, walls and enclosures.



      (6)   The height of displayed merchandise shall not exceed the
height of any fence or wall in the buffer or six feet, whichever is less.



      (7)   All outdoor displays must be located on the same lot as
the principal use.



      (8)   Areas used for such display shall be furnished with an
all-weather hard surface of a material such as bituminous or portland
concrete cement.



      (9)   Merchandise shall not be placed or located where it will
interfere with pedestrian or building access or egress, required vehicular
parking and handicapped parking, aisles, access or egress, loading space
parking or access, public or private utilities, services or drainage systems,
fire lanes, alarms, hydrants, standpipes or other fire protection equipment,
or emergency access or egress.



      (10)   Outdoor display areas shall not be located on any
parking spaces needed to comply with the minimum parking ratios of §§
153.1015 through 153.1023 of this chapter. Outdoor display areas shall be
considered part of the floor area of the principal use or structure for
purposes of computing the minimum number of parking spaces required.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7.60)



§ 153.1371  OUTDOOR STORAGE.



   (A)   Purpose and findings. This section establishes regulations for
permanent storage areas that are in “IL” (Industrial Light) and “IH”
(Industrial Heavy) Zoning Districts. Storage incidental to construction
activities is permitted in all zoning districts.



   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to commercial outdoor
storage (with the exception of salvage operations and yards as defined and
regulated by this chapter), including contractors’ yards, building supply
sales, coal sales and storage, scrap metal storage and paper and rag storage.



   (C)   Standards. Storage yards shall be enclosed by a:



      (1)   Non-climbable fence or wall at least six feet in height;
or



      (2)   Type D landscaped buffer strip, as described in §
153.1122 of this chapter.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 7.61)



§ 153.1372  RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNITS.



   (A)   Purpose and findings.



      (1)   These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing design principles,
which can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory
visual appearance, preserve taxable values and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare. This section establishes design standards to
permit appropriate densities while avoiding impacts on neighborhoods. These
standards:



         (a)   Coordinate diverse housing types so that they are
compatible with other types of housing;



         (b)   Avoid long, unbroken lines of row housing;



         (c)   Encourage housing layouts that make efficient,
economical, comfortable and convenient use of land and open space;



         (d)   Provide a physical and visual connection between
the living area of the residence and the street;



         (e)   Enhance public safety by allowing people to survey
their neighborhood from inside their residences, places of work or shopping
areas;



         (f)   Provide a more pleasant pedestrian environment by
preventing large expanses of blank facades along streets;



         (g)   Ensure that the location and amount of the living
area of the residence, as seen from the street, is more prominent than the
garage;



         (h)   Prevent garages from obscuring the main entrance
from the street and ensure that the main entrance for pedestrians, rather
than automobiles, is the prominent entrance;



         (i)   Provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment
by preventing garages and vehicle areas from dominating the views of the
neighborhood from the sidewalk;



         (j)   Enhance public safety by preventing garages from
blocking views of the street from inside the residence;



         (k)   Supplement the zoning regulations applied to
site-built, modular and manufactured homes with additional standards and
procedures, which will promote a satisfactory living environment for
residents of single-family homes and which will permit a mix of homes and
other types of housing;



         (l)   Permit greater diversity in the types of housing
communities;



         (m)   Ensure that all new single-family dwellings are
compatible with other forms of housing;



         (n)   Ensure the provision of single-family housing
opportunities for persons or families of low or moderate income by providing
for design standards that ensure compatibility among various types of housing
units as an alternative to exclusionary zoning practices;



         (o)   Provide interesting and aesthetically attractive
multi-family developments while avoiding monotonous, “barracks”-style
buildings;



         (p)   Ensure that multi-family buildings have a
multi-faceted exterior form in which articulated facades are combined with
window and door placements, as well as other detailing, to create an
interesting and attractive architectural design and limit flat walls with
minimal features; and



         (q)   Provide for zero lot line (ZLL) developments in
which houses are shifted to one side of the lot, thereby providing for
greater usable yard space on each lot, providing greater flexibility in site
development standards and maintaining a single-family detached character of a
neighborhood.



      (2)   In order to provide design flexibility and to encourage
the production of affordable housing, this section allows attached dwelling
units without adherence to the minimum lot area and internal yard
requirements provided for in the zoning district. The impervious surface
ratio and recreation area of the district apply to the total subdivision and
not to each lot within the subdivision. Common open space is distributed in
order to provide readily available amenities and visual relief to the entire
development.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   This section applies to any of the following:



         (a)   Any single-family detached dwelling unit;



         (b)   Any single-family attached or two-family dwelling
unit (duplex);



         (c)   Any townhouse or row house;



         (d)   Any cottage house;



         (e)   Any triplex, quadraplex, apartment or other
multi-family dwelling unit; and



         (f)   Any zero lot line dwelling.



      (2)   This section does not apply to dwelling units that are
included in a mixed-use building, or accessory dwelling units, which are
regulated separately in this chapter. (See § 153.1369 of this chapter.)



      (3)   This section applies to manufactured homes located on
platted lots of record or in a subdivision. This section does not apply to
manufactured home land-lease communities, which are regulated separately by
this chapter. (See § 153.1368 of this chapter.)



      (4)   Nothing in this section prevents the creation of a
subdivided lot for individual dwelling units within a building that includes
attached dwellings.



   (C)   General criteria.



      (1)   Applicability. The combination of design elements, as
described in Table 153.1372(A), is required for any dwelling unit subject to
this section.

shall exceed 8,000 square feet in size, nor exceed a FAR of 0.60. The total
area of all dwellings and accessory structures shall not exceed a FAR of 0.75.



      (3)   Main entrance.



         (a)   Location of main entrance.



            1.   A building must include a front porch or
stoop at all main entrances that face a street. The porch or stoop shall
adjoin the main entrance and the main entrance shall be accessible from the
porch.



            2.   The main entrance of each principal building
must face the street. On corner lots, the main entrance may face either of
the streets or be oriented to the corner. With buildings that have more than
one main entrance, only one entrance must meet this requirement.



         (b)   Porches. Porches used to satisfy the design
criteria shall comply with the following:



            1.   Porches shall be covered by a solid roof. The
roof shall not be located more than 12 feet above the floor of the porch. If
the roof of a required porch is developed as a deck or balcony, it may be
flat.



            2.   The porch shall have minimum dimensions of
six feet by six feet. For single-family detached dwelling units, the covered
area provided by the porch must be at least 48 square feet and a minimum of
eight feet wide. If the main entrance is for more than one dwelling unit, the
covered area provided by the porch must be at least 63 square feet and a
minimum of nine feet wide.



         (c)   Covered balconies. The covered area provided by
the balcony must be at least 48 square feet, a minimum of eight feet wide and
no more than 15 feet above grade. The covered balcony must be accessible from
the interior living space of the house.



         (d)   Openings between porch floor and ground. Openings
of more than one foot between the porch floor and the ground must be covered
with a solid material or lattice.



      (4)   Garage.



         (a)   Generally. A garage wall may not be closer to the
street lot line than the front facade elevation.



         (b)   Detached garages. These standards encourage
detached garages as an alternative to front-loaded attached garages.



            1.   Detached garages are permitted in any zoning
district. Detached garages shall be located in the rear or side yard. The
footprint for the garage structure shall not exceed 24 feet by 30 feet or 780
square feet. The garage walls shall not exceed 15 feet in height measured
from the eave to the adjacent grade, or the height of the principal
structure, whichever is less.



            2.   A detached garage that is non-conforming due
to its location in a setback may be rebuilt on its existing foundation if it
was originally constructed legally. An addition may be made to these types of
garages if the addition complies with the standards of this section, or if
the combined size of the existing foundation and any additions is no larger
than 12 feet wide by 18 feet deep. The garage walls may be up to ten feet
high.



         (c)   Street-facing garage walls.



            1.   Applicability. This section applies to
garages that are accessory to single-family detached dwelling units,
manufactured homes, duplexes or triplexes. This section does not apply to
development on flag lots or development on lots that slope up or down from
the street with an average slope of 20%.



            2.   Maximum length and size. The length of that
portion of a garage wall facing the street shall not exceed 50% of the length
of the street-facing building facade. Garage doors may not exceed 80 square
feet in area. No more than two individual garage doors are permitted per
side. On corner lots, only one street-facing garage wall must meet this
standard. Where the street-facing facade of the building is less than 24 feet
long, the garage wall facing the street may be up to 12 feet long if there is
one of the following:



               a.   Interior living area above the garage;
or



               b.   A covered balcony above the garage that
is at least the same length as the street-facing garage wall, at least six
feet deep and accessible from the interior living area of the dwelling unit.



            3.   Street lot line setbacks. A garage wall that
faces a street shall be located at least 20 feet behind the plane of the
front facade. A street-facing garage wall may adjoin the front facade or



be located within the area described in this subsection (C), where:



               a.   The street-facing garage wall does not
exceed 30% of the length of the building facade; and



               b.   The interior living area is located
above the garage. The living area must be set back no more than four feet
from the street-facing garage wall or shall include a covered balcony above
the garage that is at least the same length as the street-facing garage wall,
at least six feet deep and accessible from the interior living area of the
dwelling unit.



            4.   Street-facing garage walls prohibited in
“D” (Downtown) District or TND. Garage walls facing the street or
extending beyond the front elevation of a dwelling unit are prohibited in the
“D” (Downtown) District or a TND use pattern or district.



      (5)   Roofs.



         (a)   Slope. Principal structures must have a roof that
is sloped, with a pitch that is no flatter than six units of horizontal run
to 12 units of horizontal rise.



         (b)   Architectural features. The roof of a principal
structure shall include either or both of the following architectural details:



            1.   At least one dormer facing the street. If
only one dormer is included, it shall be at least five feet wide and shall be
centered horizontally between each end of the front elevation. If more than
one dormer is provided, a dormer at least four feet wide must be provided on
each side of the front elevation; or



            2.   A gabled end, or a gabled end of a roof
projection, facing the street.



         (c)   Roof eaves. Roof eaves must project from the
building wall at least 12 inches, measured horizontally, on at least the
front and side elevations.



      (6)   Foundation. The ground level of the first floor,
including the lowest elevation of any point of the front facade, shall be
elevated at least three feet from the horizontal surface of the street or
sidewalk. Plain concrete block or plain concrete may be used as foundation
material if the foundation material is not visible more than three feet above
the finished grade level adjacent to the foundation wall.



      (7)   Exterior finish materials.



         (a)   Plain concrete block, plain concrete, and
corrugated metal are not permitted as exterior finish material. Composite
boards manufactured from wood or other products, such as hardboard or
hardiplank, may be used when the board product is less than eight inches wide.



         (b)   Where wood products are used for siding, the
siding must be shingles or horizontal siding. Shakes are not permitted.



         (c)   Where horizontal siding is used, it must be
ship-lap or clapboard siding composed of boards with a reveal of three to
eight inches, or vinyl or aluminum siding that is in a clapboard or shiplap
pattern where the boards in the pattern are eight inches or less in width.



      (8)   Windows and entryways.



         (a)   At least 15% of the area of a street-facing facade
must include windows or main entryways.



         (b)   All street-facing windows must comply with the
requirements of this subsection (C)(8). Windows in rooms with a finished
floor height four feet or more below grade are exempt from this standard.



         (c)   Windows on the upper floors shall be vertically
oriented, except as provided in subsection (C)(8)(d) below. Windows may be
horizontally oriented if they are grouped as provided in subsection (C)(8)(d)
below, or if there is a band of individual lights across the top of the
horizontal window. The individual lights must be vertically oriented and
cover at least 20% of the total height of the window.



         (d)   Windows on the first floor shall be vertically
oriented or grouped to provide a horizontal opening. If only two windows are
grouped, both must be vertically oriented. Where more than two sizes are
grouped, the windows on the outer edges of the grouping must be vertically
oriented.



         (e)   In determining whether a window is vertically
oriented as provided in this subsection, the area of the window that includes
the panes, mullions, and transoms shall be included, and embellishments, such
as shutters, shall be excluded. (See Figure 153.1372(A) below.)

least two of the optional standards as set forth in Table 153.1372(A) above.



   (E)   Attached dwellings, generally.



      (1)   Applicability. This section applies to any attached
dwelling unit. An ATTACHED DWELLING UNIT means any duplex, townhouse or row
house.



      (2)   Zoning dimensional standards.



         (a)   The minimum lot size regulations apply to a
building that contains multiple attached dwelling units but not to each
individual dwelling unit.



         (b)   The side yard regulations of the applicable zoning
district do not apply to an attached dwelling unit. However, this section
establishes setback requirements where the building abuts single-family
residential zoning districts.



      (3)   Building design.



         (a)   Attached dwellings subject to this section must
comply with at least two of the optional standards as set forth in Table
153.1372(A) above.



         (b)   Each dwelling unit shall have a ground-floor
entrance that faces a public street or common open space.



   (F)   Two-family dwellings (duplexes). Duplexes shall conform to
subsections (F)(1) through (F)(3) below.



      (1)   Subdivision. A lot that includes two attached dwelling
units may be subdivided or resubdivided through the common wall into separate
fee simple lots for each dwelling unit subject to the following requirements:



         (a)   The two-family dwelling or duplex lot shall be
vacated and replatted as provided in Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this chapter.



         (b)   Each single-family lot resulting from the
subdivision shall have a minimum lot area of 4,000 square  feet and shall be
at least 40 feet wide, except in the case of a planned development, TND or
TOD.

   (D)   Development review process.



      (1)   Administrative approval.



         (a)   Where, pursuant to subsection (C) above,
administrative review is required, the application will be reviewed for
compliance with this chapter by the Code Enforcement Officer, who will render
a final decision of approval, denial or approval with conditions. Within 30
days of the Code Enforcement Officer’s decision, appeal may be made to the
Board of Adjustment pursuant to Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this chapter.



         (b)   When circumstances so warrant, the Code
Enforcement Officer may determine that administrative approval is not
appropriate and that the applicant must instead apply for a CUP. Such
circumstances may include the complexity of technical issues involved,
previous denials of similar wireless communications facilities in the
vicinity of the one proposed, significant public opposition to the proposed
facility, the presence of environmentally sensitive lands on or near the
proposed facility, and similar circumstances.



      (2)   Conditional use permit. Where, pursuant to subsection
(C) above, a CUP is required, the application will be reviewed as provided in
Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 and this section. If the CUP is not approved,
approved with conditions or denied within 30 days after the submittal of a
complete application, the application shall be deemed approved. The applicant
may agree to an extension of this time limit. Within 30 days of the decision,
an appeal may be made to the Board of Adjustment.



      (3)   Final decision. Any decision by the city to deny an
application for a proposed wireless communications facility must be in
writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.



   (E)   Submission requirements.



      (1)   In addition to the submissions required for a zoning
certificate, the requirements as indicated in Table 153.1378(A) above must be
provided with an application for any wireless communications facility. The
application must be signed by the property owner, the applicant and a
provider who will be placing antennas on the proposed wireless communications
facility.



      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer may modify the submission
requirements where it is determined that certain information is not required
or useful in determining compliance with the provisions of the UDC. A
decision to modify certain submission requirements must be in writing and
made a part of the application file.



      (3)   If the property owner is not a provider, the application
must include a copy of an executed lease agreement between the applicant or
property owner and a provider or, where no lease agreement has been executed,
an affidavit signed by a carrier attesting to an intent to place antennas on
the wireless communications facility if the application is approved.



   (F)   Standards. The standards for the establishment of all proposed
wireless communications facilities are as indicated by type of facility in
subsections (G) through (K) below. Where overall height requirements set
forth herein conflict with those set forth in the applicable zoning district,
those set forth herein.



   (G)   Antenna supporting structures.



      (1)   Setbacks.



         (a)   Antenna supporting structures, equipment
enclosures and ancillary appurtenances must meet the minimum setback
requirements for the zoning district in which they are proposed.



         (b)   Antenna supporting structures must be set back a
distance equal to their overall height from the lot line of any lot that
contains a residential use or that is within a residential zoning district;
however, guy-wire anchors need only comply with the provisions of subsection
(G)(1)(a) above.



         (c)   If more than one of the above setback requirements
applies to an antenna supporting structure, the more restrictive requirement
will govern. In accordance with the development review process set forth in
subsection (D) above, setback requirements for replacement antenna supporting
structures may be reduced by an amount not to exceed 50% of that required by
this chapter, but in no case may a replacement structure be placed any closer
to a lot line than the antenna supporting structure it is replacing. No
waiver will be granted pursuant to this subsection (G)(1)(c) unless the
applicant demonstrates that the existing structure cannot be replaced in
compliance with this chapter without a waiver.



      (2)   Height.



         (a)   The overall height of any antenna supporting
structure may not exceed 149 feet, except as provided in subsections
(G)(2)(b)1. and (G)(2)(b)2. below.



         (b)   Proposed broadcast antenna supporting structures
that have received a construction development approval from the Federal
Communications Commission may be constructed in accordance with the following:



            1.   AM broadcast antenna supporting structures
may not exceed 250 feet in overall height; and



            2.   Except as provided in subsection (G)(2)(b)1.
above, the overall height of a broadcast antenna supporting structure may not
exceed 500 feet.



         (c)   Within the outer island’s future land-use
districts, no antenna supporting structure may exceed 35 feet in overall
height.



      (3)   Construction. Antenna supporting structures must have a
monopole-type construction only, except as follows:



         (a)   Broadcast structures with an overall height of
greater than 200 feet may have a lattice-type construction;



         (b)   Amateur radio antennas may have a monopole-,
lattice- or guyed-type construction; and



         (c)   AM broadcast antenna supporting structures may
have a monopole- or lattice-type construction.



      (4)   Location and placement. Within the density
reduction/ground water resource future land-use districts, wireless
communications facilities will be allowed only on existing utility poles
within a right-of-way or ingress/egress or access easement.



      (5)   Lighting.



         (a)   No lights, signals or other illumination will be
permitted on any antenna supporting structure or ancillary appurtenances
unless the applicant demonstrates that lighting is required by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).



         (b)   Site lighting may be placed in association with an
approved equipment enclosure but must be shielded to prevent light trespass.
Site lighting must remain unlit, except when authorized personnel are present.



      (6)   Intensity requirements. The floor area for a wireless
communications facility will be calculated based on the total square footage
of all equipment enclosures associated with the facility.



      (7)   Accommodation of future collocations.



         (a)   Antenna supporting structures must be designed to
accommodate future collocations. The exact amount of additional equipment to
be accommodated will be agreed upon during the pre- application conference.



         (b)   As a condition of approval under this section, the
applicant must submit a shared use plan that commits the owner of the
proposed antenna supporting structure to accommodate future collocations
where reasonable and feasible in light of the criteria set forth in this
section.



      (8)   Proliferation minimized.



         (a)   Generally. No antenna supporting structure will be
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that the proposed antenna cannot
be accommodated on an existing building or structure or by construction of a
stealth facility.



         (b)   Letters of coordination.



            1.   The applicant must provide documentation that
the following notice was mailed, via certified mail, to all providers or,
where applicable, to owners of existing antenna supporting structures, and
that the applicant was unable to secure a lease agreement with a provider to
allow the placement of the proposed antennas on an existing structure or
building within the geographic search area:



 

Pursuant to the requirements of the Unified Development Code, [NAME OF
APPLICANT] is providing you with notice of our intent to meet with the City
Manager in a pre-application conference to discuss the location of a

applicant’s proposed antennas; or



            3.   That there are other limiting factors that
render collocated, surface-mounted, roof-mounted or stealth facilities
unsuitable or unreasonable.



      (9)   Color. Antenna supporting structures and ancillary
appurtenances, including transmission lines, must maintain a galvanized grey
finish or other contextual or compatible color as determined by the city,
except as otherwise required by the FAA or the FCC.



      (10)   Fencing. A fence of at least eight feet in height from
finished grade must be installed in order to enclose the base of the antenna
supporting structure and associated equipment enclosures. Access to the
antenna supporting structure must be controlled by a locked gate. The fence
must be constructed in accordance with § 153.1000 of this chapter, except
that barbed wire construction will be allowed at the discretion of the
applicant.



      (11)   Landscaping.



         (a)   A landscaped buffer of at least ten feet in width
must be planted along the entire exterior perimeter of the fence or wall as
required by subsection (G)(9) above. Where the proposed antenna supporting
structure will be located adjacent to a residential or public recreational

ancillary appurtenances and equipment enclosures must meet the minimum
setback requirements for the zoning district in which they are proposed.



         (b)   In accordance with the development review process
set forth in subsection (D) above, setback requirements for stealth
facilities may be reduced if it is determined that such a waiver is necessary
to reduce the visual impact or enhance the compatibility of the proposed
facility on adjacent properties and the surrounding community.



      (2)   Height. The overall height of a proposed stealth
facility must be limited to that which is consistent with the scale and
aesthetic qualities of the proposed facility, and to that which blends and is
consistent with the character of the surrounding community. However, in no
case may the overall height of any stealth facility exceed 149 feet.



      (3)   Aesthetics. No stealth facility may have antennas or
ancillary equipment that is readily identifiable from the public domain as
wireless communications equipment. Stealth facilities must be designed so
they are reasonably consistent with the surrounding built or natural
environment. In order to determine compliance with this requirement, the city
will consider the following criteria:



         (a)   Overall height;



         (b)   The compatibility of the proposed facility with
surrounding built and nature features;



         (c)   Scale;

designed to reasonably replicate a non-wireless facility (e.g., a silo,
flagpole or tree); and



         (g)   The extent to which the proposed facility is not
readily identifiable as a wireless communications facility.



      (4)   Private aircraft and helicopter landing facilities.
Stealth wireless communications facilities proposed within a designated
notification height boundary of a private aircraft or helicopter landing
facility, as specified on the Airspace Notification Map, will be limited to
the height specified, based on the proposed facility’s distance from the
runway or landing facility.



   (L)   Expert review.



      (1)   Due to the complexity of the methodology or analysis
required to review an application for a wireless communications facility, the
Code Enforcement Officer may require a technical review by a third-party
expert, the costs of which are to be borne by the applicant.



      (2)   The expert review may address the following:



         (a)   The accuracy and completeness of submissions;



         (b)   The applicability of analysis techniques and
methodologies;



         (c)   The validity of conclusions reached;



         (d)   Whether the proposed wireless communications
facility complies with the applicable approval criteria set forth in this
chapter; and



         (e)   Other matters deemed by the Code Enforcement
Officer to be relevant in determining whether a proposed wireless
communications facility complies with the provisions of this section.



      (3)   Based on the results of the expert review, the Code
Enforcement Officer may require changes to the applicant’s application or
required submissions.



      (4)   The applicant must reimburse the city within ten working
days of the date of receipt of an invoice for expenses associated with the
third-party expert’s review of the application. Failure by the applicant to
make reimbursement pursuant to this section will abate the pending
application until payment in full is received by the city.



   (M)   Discontinuance.



      (1)   Notice of discontinuance. In the event that all legally
approved use of an antenna supporting structure or antenna has been
discontinued for a period of 180 days, the Code Enforcement Officer may make
a preliminary determination of discontinuance. In making such a
determination, the Code Enforcement Officer may request documentation and/or
affidavits from the property owner regarding the structure’s usage,
including evidence that use of the structure is imminent. Failure on the part
of a property owner to provide updated contact information for the owner of
the antenna supporting structure for four consecutive years will be
presumptive evidence of discontinuance. At such time as the Code Enforcement
Officer reasonably determines that an antenna supporting structure or antenna
has been discontinued, the Code Enforcement Officer will provide the property
owner with a written notice of discontinuance by certified mail.



      (2)   Declaration of discontinuance. Failure on the part of
the property owner to respond to the notice of discontinuance within 90 days,
or to adequately demonstrate that the structure is not discontinued, will be
evidence of discontinuance. Based on the foregoing, or on any other relevant
evidence before the Code Enforcement Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer
may make a final determination of discontinuance, whereupon a declaration of
discontinuance will be issued to the property owner by certified mail.



      (3)   Removal of facility. Within 120 days of a declaration of
discontinuance, the property owner must either:



         (a)   Reactivate the use of the structure as a wireless
communications facility or transfer ownership of the structure to another
owner who will make such use of the facility; or



         (b)   Dismantle and remove the facility. If the facility
remains discontinued upon the expiration of 120 days, the city may enter upon
the property and remove the facility, with all costs to be borne by the
property owner.



   (N)   Non-conforming antenna supporting structures.



      (1)   Within ten years of its effective date, antenna
supporting structures made non-conforming by implementation of this section
must comply with the provisions of this chapter or must be removed.



      (2)   However, the city may extend the time period for
compliance or removal where the property owner demonstrates that the
requirements of this section impose an unreasonable burden on the ability of
a provider to provide personal wireless services or to otherwise comply with
federal regulations.



   (O)   Variances; additional criteria. No variance will be granted to
the provisions of this section unless the Board of Adjustment makes one of
the following findings of fact:



      (1)   Failure to grant the variance would prohibit or have the
effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services;



      (2)   Failure to grant the variance would unreasonably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless
services;



      (3)   The variance will obviate the need for additional
antenna supporting structures;



      (4)   The variance is necessary to ensure adequate public
safety and emergency management communications; or



      (5)   The variance is the minimum necessary in order for the
applicant to provide broadcast services pursuant to an FCC-issued
construction development approval.

   (A)   The Board of Adjustment may inquire into the existence of a
non-conformity, fire or health hazards, and any other danger or nuisance to
the public due to or created by any condition or use existing on the
property. Upon written findings, the Board may require the discontinuance of
such use. The owner of the use under inquiry shall have at least 20 days’
written notice prior to the day of the public hearing. Time allowed for
discontinuance of such use shall be prescribed by the Board at a subsequent
public hearing, after having heard from the affected parties, based on the
Board’s ruling as to a reasonable amortization period for the
non-conforming use.



   (B)   In prescribing said time period, the Board shall consider the
following factors:



      (1)   The owner’s capital investment in structures, fixed
equipment and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be
feasibly transferred to another site) on the property before the time the use
became non-conforming;



      (2)   Any costs that are directly attributable to the
establishment of a compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation
expenses, termination of leases and discharge of mortgages;



      (3)   Any return on investment since inception of the use,
including net income and depreciation; and



      (4)   The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including
net income and depreciation.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 8.16.4)



§ 153.1489  DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE OF STRUCTURE.



   (A)   The right to operate and maintain any non-conformity, except
for a single-family dwelling unit, shall terminate and shall cease to exist
whenever the structure or structures in which the non-conforming use is
operated and maintained is damaged or destroyed from any cause whatsoever,
and the cost of repairing such damage or destruction exceeds 50% of the
replacement cost of such building or structure on the date of such damage or
destruction.



   (B)   A non-conforming single-family dwelling unit that is destroyed
or damaged more than 50% of the replacement cost may be rebuilt; provided
that, a development approval is issued within one year of the date of such
damage or destruction.



   (C)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall require the submission of
sufficient evidence to verify the date of damage or destruction.

unnecessary hardship;



   (B)   The continuation of the non-conformity will not be contrary to
the public interest;



   (C)   The continuation of the non-conformity will not substantially
or permanently injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming property in
the same district;



   (D)   The use will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of
these regulations and the Comprehensive Plan goals, objectives and policies;

(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 8.21.4)



VESTED RIGHTS DETERMINATION PROCESS



§ 153.1545  INITIATION.



   An application may be made to the planning Board of Adjustment for
recognition of vested rights for a particular project by completion of a form
provided by the Code Enforcement Officer that indicates which development
approval or development approvals are being relied on by the applicant for
establishment of vested rights. The applicant for a vested rights
determination shall provide the Code Enforcement Officer with a completed
application and two copies of any documents on which the applicant is relying
to establish vested rights.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 8.22.1)



§ 153.1546  REVIEW AND APPROVAL.



   (A)   After receiving an application for a vested rights
determination, the Board of Adjustment, upon notice duly published and
provided to all owners of land within 500 feet of the applicant’s property,
shall review the application and determine if the applicant shall provide
additional information for consideration of the application within 20 working
days.



   (B)   After the application is completed, the Board of Adjustment
shall hold a public hearing and, upon the evidence submitted and upon review
of the application, if the Board of Adjustment finds that there is sufficient
evidence to establish vested rights, the Board of Adjustment shall issue a
certificate to the applicant recognizing vested rights for the project. The
certificate shall set forth all terms and conditions required for the
continuance of the vested rights being recognized.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 8.22.2)



§ 153.1547  VARIANCE.



   (A)   (1)   An individual, or business entity, that requests a
vested rights determination may at the same time request a variance from the
time limit, required action or term that otherwise would cause the vested
rights to expire.



      (2)   An individual requesting a variance must file a written
application to the Board of Adjustment, which may be filed concurrently with
the application for a vested rights determination.



      (3)   The request for variance must identify the specific
provisions for which a variance is being requested and the reasons the
applicant feels will justify the granting of the variance.



   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall review the application for
variance and shall determine whether the variance is granted, conditionally
granted or denied. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment must make
written findings establishing that:



      (1)   The applicant will suffer undue hardship in the absence
of a variance that is not the result of the applicant’s own negligence;



      (2)   The applicant has been actively attempting to pursue and
complete development of the project that is the subject of the vested rights;
and



      (3)   Compliance with rules and regulations passed after the
recognition of vested rights will cause a substantial economic hardship to
the developer/property owner, which precludes the capability of completing
the project in a reasonable and prudent manner.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § 8.22.3)

more than ten years old.

the Council, by ordinance, without further public hearing, may adopt the
proposed variation or may refer it back to the Board for further
consideration, and any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval
of the Board of Appeals shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of
two-thirds of all the members of the City Council.  In making any variation,
the Council shall be governed by the same considerations and restrictions as
set forth above.  No variations in any case shall be made by the City
Council without a hearing by the Board of Adjustment as required herein nor

of a building shall be valid for a period of longer than six months unless
such use is established within such period and such erection or alteration is
started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such
permit.



   (B)   No order for a variance permitting a use of a building or
premises shall be valid for a period longer than six months, unless such use
is established within such period; provided, however, that where such use
permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such
order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said
erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms
of such permit.

DIVISION 20: DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS



GENERALLY



§ 153.1605  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this division is to streamline the development approval
process by prescribing the information necessary for complete review of an
application for development approval.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1)



§ 153.1606  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   No application for development approval shall be considered complete,
and the Code Enforcement Officer or any other agency or official of the city
shall not process any application for development approval, unless all of the
information required by this division is included. The Code Enforcement
Officer or any other agency or official of the city shall not delay the
processing of any application for development approval if it contains the
information prescribed by this division.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.1)



§ 153.1607  FORMS.



   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall promulgate necessary forms
for the administration, interpretation and enforcement of this chapter. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain such forms at the offices of the
Planning Department.



   (B)   The forms shall require the information set forth in this
division for any application for development approval.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.2)



§ 153.1608  INFORMATION REQUIRED.



   (A)   No application for development approval shall be accepted
unless the following information and data required are included.



   (B)   The required information and data are set forth in Table
153.1625(A) of this chapter and any specific regulations set forth in this
division.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.3)



§ 153.1609  CERTIFICATIONS.



   Where this section requires a certification and/or signature by the
applicant, a professional or a public agency or official, the signature lines
shall be provided in the lower right-hand corner of the plans, plats or other
required documents.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.4)



§ 153.1610  CONTROL POINTS AND MONUMENTATION GUIDELINES.



   (A)   Primary horizontal control points will be used when surveying
each tract being subdivided. These primary horizontal control points must be
established by using centimeter-grade accuracy Global Positioning System
devices, procedures and methods that meet the state’s standards. New
primary horizontal control points must be established and monumented for each
subdivision.



   (B)   Primary horizontal control points shall be tied to at least
one National Geodetic Survey mark and the point will be identified as the
datum point on both the hard-copy and digital plat submittals.



   (C)   The minimum number of required primary horizontal control
points (reference corners) is based upon the overall plat size in acres as
described in Table 153.1632(A) of this chapter.



   (D)   The plat must include the X-Y coordinates for each of the
primary horizontal control points, and consistent and appropriate bearings
between each of the primary horizontal control points. These primary
horizontal control points will be provided in NAD83 United States survey
feet, State Plane Coordinates for the state.



   (E)   All primary horizontal control points shall be permanently
identified with monumentation set to the state’s Board of Land Surveyor’s
minimum standards.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.6)



§ 153.1611  DIGITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET AND DRAINAGE CONSTRUCTION PLAN
SUBMITTALS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   Street and drainage construction plan drawings shall be
provided to the city as traditional hard-copy Mylar drawings and as drawing
digital data. The purpose of the drawing digital data requirement is to allow
for improved document storage, retrieval and review within various city
departments, and is to be used for information purposes only. Unlike the
hard-copy documents that are signed and sealed legal documents, the drawing
digital data will have no legal significance. However, the drawing digital
data may be used to assist city employees in analyzing, understanding,
interpreting and presenting the data.



      (2)   Drawing digital data will consist of the graphical
elements represented on the final hardcopy street and drainage construction
plans submitted to the city. Signatures, seals, stamps and other non-
graphical drawing elements are not required as part of the drawing digital
data submittal. The drawing digital data shall comply with §§ 153.1625
through 153.1632 of this chapter unless a different requirement is provided
in this section.



      (3)   Drawing digital data submittals, delivered to the city
on electronic media, are required as a condition to the final approval of the
street and drainage drawing set. If the city determines that an error is
found to exist in the digital data, including the inability to read the media
on which the drawing data are delivered, discrepancies between the hard-copy
drawings and the digital data, or if the digital data are otherwise
unacceptable, the city will contact the submitting organization to have the
digital data corrected and/ or redelivered to the city prior to public works
approval of the final plat.



   (B)   Standard detail sheets in a digital format.



      (1)   The city’s drainage and capital programs departments
will provide standard details in a digital format to anyone requesting the
files. The request must be in writing and indicate the preferred file format
(MicroStation (DGN), AutoCad (DWG) or generic (DXF) format).



      (2)   These files may be e-mailed to the requestor, or
provided on electronic media.



      (3)   Since the city does not use AutoCad, the requests for
this format will be performed using the conversion software available within
MicroStation, and is provided with no claims as to the requestor’s ability
to read or use the delivered files.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.7)



DIGITAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS



§ 153.1625  GENERALLY.



   (A)   Plat information shall be provided to the city in two forms:
hard-copy subdivision plat sheets and digital plat data. The purpose of the
digital plat data requirement is to coordinate with the city’s geographic
information systems program and is to be used for information only. Unlike
the hard-copy subdivision plat, which represents a legal document, the
digital plat data may be subjected to adjustment by the city and has no legal
significance. However, the digital plat data may be used to assist city
officials in analyzing, understanding, interpreting and presenting the data.



   (B)   Digital data of subdivision plats will consist of graphical
elements representing the hard-copy subdivision plat. The applicant shall
provide digital data twice during the subdivision review process: initially,
when the subdivision plat is submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer for
plan review; and secondly, before the subdivision plat is approved by the
Planning Commission. Additional digital submittals are required if changes
occur between the second digital submittal and the recordation of the plat.
The final digital submittal must reflect the graphical elements of the
recorded plat.



   (C)   The initial digital data submittal shall include the
subdivision boundary, as a minimum. The electronic medium shall bear a label
similar to that of the final medium, as described in § 153.1630 of this
chapter, with the exception of the plat number.



   (D)   (1)   The final digital data may be submitted with the
final subdivision plat documents to the Planning Department.



      (2)   The final digital data must be submitted before the
subdivision plat is considered complete and ready for Planning Commission
consideration.



   (E)   (1)   The digital data submittals are subject to review and
approval as a condition to the subdivision plat review and approval process.
The X-Y coordinates indicated with the initial submittal are subject to
approval as provided in Divisions 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this chapter.



      (2)   If an error is found to exist in the digital data that
the city cannot correct, or if the digital data are otherwise unacceptable,
the city will contact the submitting organization to have the digital data
corrected.



   (F)   Both the digital and hard-copy files must contain all the
elements consistent with accurately defining the geometry and global position
of the proposed subdivision. In addition, the following two key data elements
are also required on plat submittals:



      (1)   All new street names must have been approved by the
United States Postal Service and shown on the hard-copy and digital plat
submittals. The city will not accept unnamed street designations, such as
Street “A”.



      (2)   The plat must contain a lot number for each proposed
lot. The city will not accept invalid block numbers, such as Block “D”.



   (G)   Failure to provide approved street names and correct and
unique block and lot numbers may result in significant delays as no plat will
be approved until these key data are determined.

§ 153.1626  DATA LAYER/LEVEL REQUIREMENTS.



   Data shall be separated into the feature categories as defined in Table
153.1625(B) of this chapter, each residing on its own unique level or layer.
Any layer name or level number is acceptable as long as each feature set is
on its own individual layer or level.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.5.2)



§ 153.1627  ADDITIONAL DIGITAL CRITERIA.



   The following additional criteria will apply to data submitted
digitally.



   (A)   Cells shall be fully expanded.



   (B)   Curves shall only be used to represent irregular boundaries.



   (C)   The subdivision outside of the boundary shall be transmitted
as a closed figure. For example, the subdivision boundary is represented as
one polyline rather than a series of lines, arcs, and curves. This will
assure closure of the subdivision perimeter.



   (D)   Curvilinear boundaries, rather than lines or arcs, shall be
represented by sufficient points to unambiguously define the boundary.
Examples of curvilinear boundaries might include the centerline of a stream,
a high-water mark, contour lines and transition curves on railroads.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.5.3)



§ 153.1628  FORMATS FOR GRAPHICAL DATA.



   Any of the following formats are allowed for digital plat data
submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer or city: (Note to reader: The UDC,
as adopted in your community, should indicate which software is the graphics
format used by the reviewing agency, and that no conversion is required when
data are provided in this format. The regulations may provide that the
software used to produce the files should be the most current or prior
version of the product. It may also indicate that files produced using older
versions of the software (e.g., over two releases old) will not be accepted.)



   (A)   DWG (AutoCAD) (Autodesk): This file format is used by Autodesk
with their AutoCAD product. This is the preferred way for AutoCAD users to
transfer files to the city;



   (B)   DGN (MicroStation) (Bentley): DGN files created on electronic
media for delivery to the city will be created as ASCII files. No reference
files will be attached to DGN files submitted to the city; and



   (C)   DXF (generic): DXF (Drawing Exchange File) is an exchange
format developed by Autodesk for use with their AutoCAD product. This format
is the preferred exchange format for organizations that use graphics software
provided by vendors other than Bentley or Autodesk. Only the ASCII output
file option will be accepted for this exchange format. A binary DXF output
format option is available, but it will not be accepted as a valid exchange
format.



(Ord. 3020, passed 9-10-2013, § B-1.5.4)



§ 153.1629  FILE-NAMING CONVENTIONS.



   The applicant shall submit one file for each plat that is submitted to
the city. File-naming conventions will be used as described in Table

§ 153.9999  PENALTY.



   (A)   Types of violations. Any act of commission or omission
contrary to the commands or directives of this chapter, or any breach of any
duty imposed by this chapter, is a violation of this chapter.



   (B)   Civil enforcement.



      (1)   Enforcement actions. The Code Enforcement Officer or any
proper person may institute any appropriate civil action or proceedings to
prevent violations or threatened violations of these regulations. In
particular, but without limitation, in case any building or structure is
erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or
maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this
chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer or any proper person may institute any
appropriate action or proceedings to:



         (a)   Prevent such unlawful acts and restrain, correct
or abrogate such violation;



         (b)   Prevent the occupancy of the building, structure
or land; or



         (c)   Prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use
in or about such premises, including, but not limited to, all remedies
provided in state statutes or city ordinances. The imposition of any penalty
does not preclude the city or any proper person from instituting any
appropriate action or proceedings to require compliance with the provisions
of the UDC and with administrative orders and determinations made under the
UDC.



      (2)   Penalties. The penalty for violating any section or
other part of the UDC is shown in Table 153.9999(A) below. Each day a
violation is permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.

Maximum Fine


Subdivision
 
$200
 
$1,000


Zoning



 



   (C)   Violation of conditions.



      (1)   Penalty. The violation of any condition imposed pursuant
to a development order or a development approval pursuant to this chapter,
including, but not limited to, a CUP or conditional zoning district is a
violation of this chapter and may be prosecuted in municipal court regardless
of whether civil or administrative action is taken against the development
approval holder.



      (2)   Revocation of development approval. The Code Enforcement
Officer is authorized to issue any administrative order necessary to
terminate or suspend a use found, as a result of the administrative process
noted in § 153.0497 of this chapter, to be in violation of a condition.



      (3)   Civil action. The Code Enforcement Officer may request
the City Attorney to institute a civil action as prescribed in this chapter
regardless of whether a criminal or administrative action is taken against
the development approval holder.



   (D)   Completion of improvements.



      (1)   Liability. A subdivider shall be held liable to the city
for the completion of all site improvements required by these regulations
until such time as the improvements shall have been actually completed and
accepted by the city.



      (2)   Remedy.



         (a)   If the construction of site improvements has been
guaranteed by a form of security described in §§ 153.0830 through 153.0838
of this chapter, and such improvements have not been completed and accepted
by the city within the time period prescribed by these regulations, the City
Manager, after written notification has been given to the subdivider, shall
take such action as may be required to cause payment to be made to the city
of the amounts of money secured by a guarantee of performance. Such amounts
of money shall be used by the City Manager to finance the completion of the
required improvements. In the event that the amounts of money referred to
above are insufficient to finance the completion of the required
improvements, the City Manager shall so notify the subdivider in writing and
shall require the subdivider either to complete the improvements without
delay or to make available to the city the amount of money required to
finance their completion.



         (b)   Should the subdivider fail to do either of the
above and such failure is not due to strikes, riots, acts of God, acts of a
public enemy, injunction or other court action, or any other cause similar to
those enumerated beyond the subdivider’s control, the City Manager shall
refer the matter to the City Attorney for such action as the City Attorney
may deem appropriate to compel the subdivider to comply with the provisions
of the improvement agreement entered into by the subdivider as a condition
precedent to the approval of the plat, or to pursue any other remedy that may
be available to the city. Until such time as the required site improvements
have been completed and accepted by the city, the City Manager shall refuse
to accept from such subdivider a performance guarantee under any form that is
related to the plat of a subdivision, in which such subdivider has a
principal or subsidiary interest.



      (3)   Exemptions. This section does not apply if a subdivider
is prevented from completing and having accepted such required site
improvements within the prescribed time by reason of strikes, riots, acts of
God, acts of a public enemy, injunction or other cause similar to those
enumerated beyond the subdivider’s reasonable control. The subdivider shall
be entitled to an extension of time equal to the time of such delay that
shall be fixed by written certificate made by the City Manager. It is
expressly declared that no such allowance of time will be made unless claimed
by the subdivider and allowed and certified in writing by the City Manager at
the end of each period of such delay.



   (E)   Whoever violates any provision of § 153.1380 for which
another penalty is not specifically provided shall be fined not less than
$100 and not more than $750 for each and every violation thereof. Every day
the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense (see § 10.99).
