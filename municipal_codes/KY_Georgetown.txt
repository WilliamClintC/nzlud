PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City
of Georgetown of a general and permanent nature.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as
supplemented through June 6, 1974, and ordinances subsequently adopted by
the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note
appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the
adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back
of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as
supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical
order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to
facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state
law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the
back of this volume.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many
state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component
parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter
number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section
within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the
third section of Chapter 2 is 2-3. Under this system, each section is identified
with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can
be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for
amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section
that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added,
such new section would be numbered 4-1.5. New chapters may be included in
the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12
and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the
alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new
chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or,
in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the
article or division.
Index
The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each
particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings

JOBNAME: No Job Name PAGE: 12 SESS: 2 OUTPUT: Fri Dec 17 11:08:08 2004
/first/pubdocs/mcc/3/14009_takes_tag_mcc_3_btaylor
being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others
in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are
numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to
direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially
directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the
Code.With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the
final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the
appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be
distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment,
when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend
largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will
then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to
avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R.
Langford, President, and Bill Carroll, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal
Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, Credit is gratefully given to the other
members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
throughout the project.
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. David H. Ashley, City Attorney, for
his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It
is hoped that his efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of
Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of
the City's affairs.

Follows:
Section 1. That the Code of Ordinances, consisting of Chapters 1 to 20, each
inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted as "Code of Ordinances, City of

Section 2. That all provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect
from and after December 1, 1983, and all ordinances of a general and

1983, and not included in such Code or recognized and continued in force by
reference therein, are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of such
Code.
Section 3. That the repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be

subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance.
Section 4. That unless another penalty is expressly provided, a violation of
any provision of such Code, or any provisions of any rule or regulation adopted
or issued pursuant thereto, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for up to thirty (30) days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment, as provided in section 1-13 of such Code.
Section 5. That any and all additions and amendments to such Code, when
passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the governing body to make
the same a part of such Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in such Code,

such additions and amendments.
Section 6. That in case of the amendment of any section of such Code for
which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in section 4 of

in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held
to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed
therein.
Section 7. Any ordinance adopted after April 21, 1983, which amends or
refers to ordinances which have been codified in such Code, shall be construed
as if they amend or refer to like provisions of such Code.

Checklist of Up-to-Date Pages
(This checklist will be updated with the
printing of each Supplement)
From our experience in publishing Looseleaf Supplements on a page-for-page
substitution basis, it has become evident that through usage and supplementation many
pages can be inserted and removed in error.
The following listing is included in this Code as a ready guide for the user to determine
whether the Code volume properly reflects the latest printing of each page.
In the first column all page numbers are listed in sequence. The second column reflects
the latest printing of the pages as they should appear in an up-to-date volume. The letters
"OC" indicate the pages have not been reprinted in the Supplement Service and appear as
published for the original Code. When a page has been reprinted or printed in the
Supplement Service, this column reflects the identification number or Supplement Number
printed on the bottom of the page.
In addition to assisting existing holders of the Code, this list may be used in compiling
an up-to-date copy from the original Code and subsequent Supplements.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what
ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a
general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes."
Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book
and are considered "Omits."
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances
will be able to gain a more complete picture of the code's historical evolution.

or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive
changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is
necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:

(2) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivi-
sions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines,
headings and titles;

Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or
other subdivision numbers;
(4) Change the words
??
this ordinance
??
or words of the same meaning to
??
this chapter,
??
??
this article,
?? ??
this division,
??
etc., as the case may be or to
??
sections to
??
(inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which
embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of
the ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make
any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the
supplement or already embodied in the Code.
(Code 1966, § 1.8)

day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
(Code 1966, § 1.9)
Sec. 1-13. General penalty; continuing violations.

imprisonment for a term not exceeding thirty (30) days or by both such fine and
imprisonment; provided, however, that the fine, forfeiture or penalty for a violation of this
GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1-13
Supp. No. 10 7
Code shall not be less than the fine, forfeiture or penalty imposed by any state statute for the
same offense. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code shall continue shall
constitute a separate offense, unless otherwise provided in this Code.
(b) In addition to the penalties provided for in subsection (a) any violation or condition
which constitutes a nuisance may be abated by the city.
(Code 1966, § 1.10)

Sec. 1-14. Administrative hold.
(a) Persons, businesses or entities who:
(1) Own property in the city for which there exists:
a. Unpaid city ad valorem taxes,
b. Unpaid fines and abatement costs assessed by the city, or
c. A final order finding a violation of any code or ordinance of the city that has not
been remedied, or
(2) Are delinquent on payment or filing of occupational license/net profits taxes,
insurance premium taxes, tourism taxes or any other taxes owed to the city or its
agencies shall be administratively ineligible for the issuance of any license, permit or
other approval issued by the city or its agencies, including the planning commission
and staff, building inspection department, revenue commission, city clerk, city
engineer, or fire department, or by any agency with which the city has an agreement
for reciprocal application of this section, until such time as the deficiency or
deficiencies have been corrected. Notwithstanding this prohibition, the city or
agency may issue any permit necessary to remedy the condition causing the
administrative ineligibility.
(b) An administrative hold resulting from the application of section (a) shall run with the
land and be binding on the person, business or entity's successors and heirs, provided that
the successors and heirs have notice or constructive notice of the delinquent obligation. The
filing of a lien in the county clerk's office shall presumptively establish constructive notice to
all persons.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 2-1. Persons responsible for compliance with city regulations.
(a) Designation of responsible person[s]: All persons, whether individual, corporate or other
status, shall, as part of:
(1) The application for business license;
(2) Application for building permit;
(3) Application for development plan or subdivision plat, whether preliminary or final;
(4) Application for electrical permit, or
(5) Other transaction or undertaking within the city that requires a license, permit or
other approval, whether made to the city, one of its agencies or to the planning and
zoning commission, electrical inspection department or other county or joint agency
authorized to enforce city regulations;
provide to the city or its agent the list of all personnel having substantial responsibility to the
city for compliance with the city's regulations appropriate to the office from which the license,
permit or other approval is sought. The designation of a "responsible person[s]" shall be made
on a form the city shall provide and be signed by the individual so designated.
(b) Accountability of responsible person[s]: All persons designated under subsection (a)
above, shall be deemed "responsible person[s]" for all enforcement purposes, civil and criminal,
and be subject to all remedies available by law to the city for the enforcement and collection
of all sums due to the city, including, but not limited to fees, fines, penalties and restitution.
The city acknowledges that any debt collected pursuant to this section will be a debt primarily
of the organization and not of the "responsible person[s]". However, in order to better serve its
constituents and assure the equal implementation of local regulation, "responsible person[s]"
may be held responsible in the city's discretion regardless of remedies available against the
organization. In no event, however, shall the city collect more than the actual amount due to
the city. Nothing in this section shall affect any claims between the entity and its "responsible
person[s]" including, but not limited to the right of indemnification.
(c) Failure to register responsible person[s] and responsibility despite that failure:
(1) In the event the city record does not reflect a designation of "responsible person[s]",
upon twenty (20) days' written notice, the entity shall file the designation required
pursuant to subsection (a) above. Failure, after notice, to provide the designation may
result in denial of requested license, permit or approval. Failure to provide may also
result in revocation of a business license.
(2) Failure of the city or its agency to receive or record the required designation of
"responsible person[s]" shall not relieve those persons employed by the regulated
businesses who actually have the responsibility and discretion within the organization
for local regulation compliance from subjection to all remedies available by law to the
city for enforcement and collection as set out in subsection (b) above. Preliminary to
ADMINISTRATION § 2-1
Supp. No. 3 59
initiating proceedings against a person[s] actually responsible for noncompliance with
city regulation, the city must make a finding of fact, supported by reasonable evidence,
that the person[s] whom the city seeks to hold responsible was in fact responsible for
the noncompliance with city regulation.
(d) Notice to responsible person[s] designated: All businesses providing to the city the names
of "responsible person[s]" pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall give written notice of the
provision and a copy of this section to each person named within three (3) days of the name[s]
being provided to the city. The city shall remove the name of a "responsible person[s]" upon
request of the person[s] to be removed and the submission of a replacement person[s] as
appropriate.
(e) Penalties:
(1) Failure to provide the name[s] of "responsible person[s]" as required by subsection (a)
above; or
(2) Failure to notify the city or its agency in the event a person whose name has been
provided pursuant to subsection (a) above, leaves his or her employment with that
business or otherwise ceases to be appropriate for designation as "responsible person"
under this section, shall subject the employer business and the designated "responsible
person[s]" to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first offense, with the fine
doubling for each offense within a twelve-month period.

order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If it determines that a violation was
committed, an order shall be issued upholding the citation and ordering the offender to do
either or both of the following:
(1) Pay a civil fine up to the maximum authorized by ordinance; or
(2) Remedy a continuing violation in order to avoid the imposition of a fine as authorized
by ordinance.
(g) Every final order of the board or the assigned hearing officer shall be reduced to
writing, which shall include the findings and conclusions of the board, and the date the order
was issued. A copy of the order shall be furnished to the person named in the citation. If the
person named in the citation is not present at the time a final order of the board is issued,
the order shall be delivered to that person by regular first-class mail; certified mail, return
receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving a copy of the order at that person's
usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of
age or older and who is informed of the contents of the order.
(Ord. No. 16-009, § 1, 9-12-16)
Sec. 2-310.21. Appeals; final judgment.
(a) Within seven (7) days of the entry of a final order issued by the hearing officer, the
order may be appealed by the alleged violator to the board, which shall review the record
created before the hearing officer and determine whether there is substantial evidence on
the record to support a finding by the hearing officer that a violation was committed. If the
board determines that there is not substantial evidence on the record, it shall issue an order
dismissing the citation. If the board determines that there is substantial evidence on the
record that a violation was committed, it shall issue a final order upholding the order
entered by the hearing officer. The failure to file an appeal within seven (7) days shall render
the order entered by the hearing officer final for all purposes and an individual receiving a
final order under this subparagraph shall be required to exhaust the administrative remedy
of appeal to the code enforcement board before appealing to district court as authorized
under KRS 65.8831.
(b) An appeal from any final order of the board may be made to the Scott District Court
within thirty (30) days of the date the order is issued. The appeal shall be initiated by the
filing of a complaint and a copy of the board's order in the same manner as any civil action
under the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court shall review the final order
de novo.

(c) A judgment of the Scott District Court may be appealed to the Scott Circuit Court in
accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
(d) If no appeal of the final order of the board is filed within the time allowed in
subsection (a) of this section, the board's order shall be deemed final for all purposes.
(Ord. No. 16-009, § 1, 9-12-16)
Sec. 2-310.22. Abatement.
(a) All violations of ordinances and codes enforced under this division shall be remedied
by the violator within the time period specified in the specific ordinance or code, unless the
code enforcement officer determines that a shorter time is warranted. In the absence of a
specified time period, the time period for remedy of a violation shall not exceed ten (10) days,
however the code enforcement officer, board or hearing officer may grant an extension of this
time period. The time period for the violation to be remedied shall not be less than
twenty-four (24) hours following issuance of the citation, unless the code enforcement officer
has reason to believe that the existence of the violation presents imminent danger, a serious
threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate action, the
effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. The time period shall commence
upon the issuance of a citation in accordance with subsection 2-310.18(b) of this division.
(b) If the property owner so served does not abate the violation within the applicable time
period, the city may proceed to abate such violation, keeping an account of the expense of
abatement. The abatement costs, including necessary and reasonable costs for and
associated with clearing, preventing unauthorized entry to, or demolishing all or a portion of
a structure or premises, or taking any other action with regard to a structure or premises
necessary to remedy a violation and to maintain and preserve the public health, safety, and
welfare in accordance with any local government ordinance, shall be charged to and paid by
the property owner.
(c) Filing of notice to contest a citation in accordance with subsection 2-310.18(g) of this
division shall serve to toll the city's abatement of the violation, unless the code enforcement
officer has reason to believe that the existence of the violation presents imminent danger, a
serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate
action, the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. In the event the board
or a hearing officer determines that the violation contested did occur, the board or hearing
officer may order that the abatement proceed immediately or within a specified time period
not to exceed thirty (30) days.
(c) The code official shall bill the property owner of such premises at least once following
abatement. No lien claimed shall be filed against the property until seven (7) days have
elapsed after the bill is sent. If the property is the subject of litigation, the lien may be filed
immediately upon the mailing of the bill.

Sec. 2-310.23. Liens, fines, charges and fees.
(a) The city shall possess a lien on property owned by the person found by a final,
non-appealable final order as defined by KRS 65.8805(8), or by a final judgment of the court,
to have committed a violation of a City ordinance. The lien shall be for all civil fines assessed
for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the
enforcement of the ordinance, including abatement costs. An affidavit of the code enforce-
ment officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity
of the proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839. The lien:
(1) Shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk;
(2) Shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear interest
until paid;
(3) Subject to KRS 65.8836, shall take precedence over all other liens, except state,
county, school board, and city taxes;
(4) Shall continue for ten (10) years following the date of the nonappealable final order,
or final judgment of the court; and
(5) May be enforced by judicial proceedings, including an action to foreclose.
(b) A copy of the notice of the lien shall be mailed to the owner of the premises. However,
the failure to mail the owner a copy of such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such
notice shall not affect the right of the city to enforce its lien for such charges as provided by
law.
(c) In addition to the remedy prescribed above, the person found to have committed the
violation shall be personally responsible for the amount of all fines assessed for the violation
and for all charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the
applicable Code of Ordinances.
(d) The city attorney is authorized to bring a civil action for the collection of delinquent
liens and other costs incurred by the city, and the city shall have the same remedies as
provided for the recovery of a debt. The city attorney is granted authority to use his or her
best judgment and discretion to settle any fine and remedy assessments and to release liens
as he deems to be in the best interests of the city. The city attorney is further authorized to
make a determination that a lien not be filed if the cost of the lien and collection is greater
than the amount of the lien, when intervening in existing litigation is not cost effective or
when the lien would not be enforceable as a matter of law. The city attorney is also
authorized to release any existing liens that meet the above criteria.

electronic mailing address.
(4) At least once per month and not more than once per week, the city shall send
electronic mail notification of all final orders entered pursuant to this division since
the last date of notification to each party registered pursuant to this section. The

activity or relationship can reasonably be expected to require more than sporadic withdrawal
must resign or cease such outside employment or activity. An officer or employee should not
begin employment or an activity or relationship that can reasonably be expected to require
more than sporadic withdrawal. If a prospective officer or employee is in such a situation, he
or she should not accept the position with the city.
(d) Request to withdraw. If an officer or appointed board member is requested to
withdraw from participation in a matter, for the reason that he or she has a conflict of

(a) Pursuant to KRS 243.075 and KRS 242.185(5), there is hereby imposed a regulatory
license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each license issued by the
administrator. The regulatory license fee shall be five (5) percent of gross sales of all alcoholic
beverages sold by the drink. In the case of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the
§ 2.7-12 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 180
regulatory license fee shall be seven (7) percent of gross sales. The regulatory license fee shall
be seven (7) percent on gross retail sales of package malt beverages. Thereafter, the city council
shall adopt at the budget adoption for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for the
regulatory license fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city
for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expense related to the sale
of alcoholic beverages in the city. Should the city fail to address the regulatory license fee in
any budget, then the regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed
until such time as the city council shall adjust the fee.
(b) Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the administrator, and shall be held
in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully reimbursing the city for the
estimated cost of any additional policing, regulatory or administrative expense related to the
sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any
other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against a regulatory license
fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to any license fee imposed by the city
pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the regulatory license fee shall accompany the license
fee return approved for such use by the city council. The return and payment are due no later
than by the end of the month immediately following each calendar quarter.
(c) Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten (10) days of the due date constitutes
a violation and will subject licensee to suspension or revocation.
(d) Penalty for failure to file a return and pay quarterly remittance by the due date is five
(5) percent of the tax for each ninety (90) days or fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty
shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the fee; provided, however, that in no case shall the
penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(e) Interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum will apply to any late payments.

Sec. 2.7-21. [In general.]
(a) The duties of the city alcoholic beverage control administrator [the "administrator"]
are assigned to the city clerk-treasurer.
(b) The functions of the administrator shall be the same with respect to the city licenses
and regulations as the functions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky ["ABC board"] with respect to state licenses and regula-
tions, except that no amendment to these regulations proposed by the administrator
may be less stringent than the statutes relating to alcoholic beverage control, or than
regulations of theABC board. No regulation of the administrator shall become effective
until the city council has first appropriately approved it.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 2.7-21
Supp. No. 9 181
(c) No person shall be an administrator, an investigator or an employee of the city under
the supervision of the administrator, who would be disqualified to be a member of the
ABC board under KRS 241.100.
(d) The administrator shall have all authority as authorized under KRS chs. 241—244.
The administrator, and any administrator's investigators, may inspect any premises
where alcoholic beverages are manufactured, sold, stored or otherwise trafficked in,
without first obtaining a search warrant.
(e) Should the administrator at any time have reasonable grounds to believe that any
applicant, licensee, employee of a licensee, or any stockholder, agent or employee of a
licensed corporation, LLC or other business organization, has a criminal record, he
shall have the authority to require such person to appear in person at the Georgetown
Police Department for the purpose of having his or her fingerprints taken.
(f) The administrator before entering upon his or her duties as such, shall take the oath
as prescribed in Section 228 of the Constitution and shall execute a bond with a good
corporate surety in the penal sum of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
The administrator may require any employee under the administrator's supervision to
execute a similar bond in such penal sum as the administrator deems necessary.

(a) Appeals from the orders of the administrator may be taken to the state ABC board by
filing with the board within thirty (30) days a certified copy of the orders of the administrator.
The board shall hear matters at issue as upon an original proceeding. Appeals from orders of
the administrator shall be governed by KRS ch. 13B.
(b) When any decision of the administrator shall have been appealed, or when a protest has
been lodged against an application for any license within the city, and the ABC board shall
have made a decision regarding such appeal or protested application, the administrator, upon
receipt of notice of finality of the decision, shall enter such orders and take such action as
required by the final order of the ABC board. As provided by law, and as used herein, no order
of the ABC board is final until all appeals or appeal times shall have been exhausted. A "final
order" of the ABC board is the order entered by said board, unless an appeal is taken from the
board's order, in which case the "final order" is the order entered by the board upon direction
from the reviewing court of last resort in the final order of said reviewing court.

concerning the applicant and the premises for which the license is sought as required by the
Kentucky Revised Statutes, the ABC board and the city, including as follows:
(1) Name and address;
(2) Nature of interest;
(3) Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
(4) Date of birth;

(d) In addition to the above specified information, the applicant shall file with the
application responses to any additional questions as may be posed or prescribed by the
administrator. The city council has adopted a statement of guidelines and priorities for the
issuance of licenses and, in order to determine the extent to which applications may further or
impede the objectives of those guidelines, the council may, by municipal order, adopt a
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 2.7-32
Supp. No. 9 183
questionnaire to be submitted to applicants for licenses. Upon adoption of the questionnaire,
it shall become a part of the application process. The questionnaire may be altered, expanded,
supplemented or replaced by municipal order of the council hereafter. In addition to the
information contained in the application and any city ordered questionnaire, the administra-
tor may require such other information as the administrator may in his/her discretion deem
desirable, reasonable or appropriate to the consideration of the application.

Sec. 2.7-33. Other conditions.
In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or permitted by law.
(1) The administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage license or approve a renewal
of a license until the applicant and his place of business shall have been approved by
the city building inspector, and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky
Building Code, and the local zoning administrator;
(2) All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check and shall sign
a waiver allowing the release of this information to the administrator;
(3) No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or renewed to any person
who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due the city at the time of issuing
the license, nor shall any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any delinquent
§ 2.7-32 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 184
taxes or fees due the city. Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of
any taxes or any fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to
sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension;
(4) No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in any manner attempt
to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the administrator, or any member of
his or her staff, or any state ABC administrator or staff, in any matter in which an
application or proposed application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspen-
sion is pending before such officer. This paragraph is not intended to stifle expressions
of opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC administrators are
public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law, both local
and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the revocation or suspension
of a license, who engages in attempted bribes, threats, attempted undue influence or
intimidation of a city or state ABC administrator or staff shall be disqualified from
receiving or retaining a license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The
procedures for appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or suspensions
under this section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary
settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or
revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and applicable statutes allow for such
payments in settlement.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.3, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-34. Form of license.

Sec. 2.7-35. Change of information.
(a) If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been issued, there is a change
in any fact required to be set forth in the application, a verified amendment in writing giving
notice of the change shall be filed with the administrator within ten (10) days of the change.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 2.7-35
Supp. No. 8 185
(b) Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of corporations or other
business organizations, it is necessary that ownership changes in such organizations be
reported to the administrator. The administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to
whom the ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that person
is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic beverage license.
(1) As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other business organization
herein, the word "change" is construed to include any change in managers, partners or
LLC members, directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock
whereby any person secures ten (10) percent of the outstanding ownership or stock.
Transfer of more than ten (10) percent of the total ownership or stock shall require a
new license.
(2) The following information will be required concerning any new manager, partner or
LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any interest in alcoholic
beverage license:
a. Name and address;
b. Nature of interest;
c. Whether or not a citizen of the United States;
d. Date of birth;
e. Date residence was established in Kentucky, if a resident of Kentucky. If a
Georgetown, resident indicate when residence was established;
f. Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other license or in any LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license under
this act;
g. Extent of stock or company ownership;
h. Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in any LLC,
corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in any
other state or province.
(3) This information shall be filed with the administrator as a verified amendment of the
application pursuant to which the license was granted. Filing shall be made within ten
(10) days of any change of required information.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.5, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-36. Renewal of license.
(a) Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee shall renew its
license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the administrator no less than thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall be
canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises
licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act of God, casualty,
death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or
§ 2.7-35 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 8 186
other governmental agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain,
whether such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of
landlord to renew existing lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified
statement no less than twenty (20) days from the expiration date of the license, setting forth
these facts, and the administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a
renewal of such license for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the
administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date
of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not by payable until application is made
for the transfer of said license to a new location.
(b) The renewal by the administrator of the license shall not be construed to be a waiver or
acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to such renewal and shall not prevent
subsequent proceedings against the licensee.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.6, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-37. Lost or destroyed license.
When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the licensee or his
agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the
administrator after the administrator shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided,
however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for
the duplicate license.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.7, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-38. Revocation or suspension.
Any license may be revoked or suspended by the administrator if the licensee shall have
violated any of the provisions of KRS chs. 241—244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC board
or of the department of revenue relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and
transportation or taxation of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall have violated or shall
violate any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or
commission, or this chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of
the manufacture, sale and transportation or taxation of intoxicating liquors or any rules or
regulations of the city heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of KRS chs. 241—244
to be created, irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or
whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his instructions, or any such license
may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the administrator in the exercise of his
sound discretion deems sufficient.
(1) A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the administrator would
have been required to refuse a license if the facts had been known.
(2) In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be revoked or suspended for
the following causes:
a. Conviction of the licensee or his agent or employee for selling any illegal
beverages on the premises licensed.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 2.7-38
Supp. No. 8 187
b. Making any false, material statements in an application for a license.
c. If within a period of two (2) consecutive years, any licensee or any clerk, servant,
agent or employee of the licensee shall have been convicted of two (2) violations
of the terms and provisions of KRS Chapter 241—244 or any act heretofore or
hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and
transportation of alcoholic beverages or if within such period, any licensee or any
clerk, servant, agent or employee of the license shall have twice been convicted of
any felony or of any misdemeanor directly or indirectly attributable to the use of
alcoholic beverages, or of one (1) such felony and one (1) such misdemeanor.
d. Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an excise tax or any
part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the provisions of any statutes,
this chapter or acts of Congress relative to taxation, or for a violation of any rules
or regulations of the department of revenue made in pursuance thereof.
e. Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed premises, any
gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift enterprise, or
handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse races; or permitting
to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on the licensed premises,

tunity to contest; appeal; effect of revocation or suspension.
(a) Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any law enforcement
officer or of the administrator, the administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or
suspend any license granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only
after the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered mail, of the
proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such proposed action. The licensee
shall be given opportunity to be heard in opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension.
The notice of proposed action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the
hearing. Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in the last
application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or in amendment of the
application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or claimed.
(b) The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for revocation or
suspension shall be prescribed by the city council by municipal order. Such order shall be
maintained on file in the office of the administrator and a copy furnished with any notice of
proposed revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the council shall fail to adopt such
municipal order, the procedures shall be those set out in the Kentucky Administrative
Procedure Act (KRS ch. 13B).
(c) A decision of the administrator revoking or suspending a license may be appealed as
provided in KRS 243.550.
§ 2.7-38 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 8 188
(d) Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or suspension of a license becomes
final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed
premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the
address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the
application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once
surrender his license to the administrator. If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith
surrendered by the licensee, the chief of police at the request of the administrator shall
immediately cause one of his officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to
the administrator.
(e) When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may, with prior
approval of the administrator, dispose of and transfer his stock of alcoholic beverages to an
appropriate entity.
(f) Appeal from the decision of the administrator revoking or suspending a license shall be
to the ABC board. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay further proceedings for revocation.
(g) If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the administrator, and the decision
is not appealed, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his license.
Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC board sustaining or ordering revocation or
suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this
license.

location except with prior approval of the administrator and not then until a payment of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be made to the administrator.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.10, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-41. Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses.
(a) The administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for any of the following
reasons:
(1) Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension or revocation of a city
license shall be the same as provided for state licenses according to KRS 243.450,
243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol
beverage licensing, sales or the administration thereof.
(2) If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license would be authorized;
or
(3) If the applicant has made any false material statement in his application.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 2.7-41
Supp. No. 8 189
(b) In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the administrator is
hereby directed to consider, in addition to the factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and
243.500, and any other factors the administrator determines in his or her discretion to be
reasonable and pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:
(1) Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who are invested in the
Georgetown community.
(2) Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most positive impact on
the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property investment and revenues to the
city.
(3) Site of business. The city is interested in serving all geographic areas of the city.
Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all licensed ABC outlets in one area.
(4) Aesthetics. The city is committed to protecting the character and beauty of our
community.
(5) Revitalization of downtown. The city wholeheartedly supports the revitalization of
downtown and the revitalization and reuse of existing buildings.
(6) Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their ability to financially
support and sustain their viability.
(7) Public support of licensed business in the area. The city intends that public sentiment
and safety be considered in deciding upon the approval of retail liquor sales licenses in
any area of the city.
(c) An applicant who has been refused a license by the administrator may appeal the
refusal to the ABC board pursuant to KR 241.200.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.11, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-42. Review of license; books, records and reports.
(a) Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide periodic
information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of any license, such as, but not
limited to, the continuing requirement that a minimum percentage of the applicant's business
income is earned from the sale of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to
be coordinated with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the
form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic
in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly report. In the case
of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date
and address of the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food
sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports
notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any licensee and
examine the books and records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all
parts of this chapter. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not met during
any particular quarter, the administrator shall have discretion in determining whether
revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time
§ 2.7-41 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 8 190
to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the administrator
may apply an accounting period of at least one (1) year in determining whether or not the food
sale percentage requirement has been met.
(b) (1) Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon the licensed
premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved in the sale of
alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and regulations of the
ABC board. Such books and records shall be available at all reasonable times for
inspection by the administrator and such city employees who may assist the admin-
istrator in his or her review.
(2) For the purpose of assisting the administrator in enforcement of this chapter, every
licensee required to report to the ABC board under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy
of such report to the administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences
to the ABC board required by statute shall be furnished to the administrator.
(Ord. No. 12-015, Art. IV, § 4.12, 9-26-12)
Sec. 2.7-43. Dormancy.
(a) It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business authorized by such a license
or else the license will be declared dormant and become null and void after ninety (90) days.
Such is the intent of this section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his
business interrupted by situations not under his control, various exceptions to the dormancy
rule have been included in this section.
(b) Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of ninety (90) days
shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) below are proved
to the satisfaction of the administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the administrator.
If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the administrator.
(c) The provisions of paragraph (b) hereof shall not apply to any licensee who is unable to
continue in business at the premises for which a license is issued due to construction, an act
of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other
governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the
expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the administrator a
verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for
any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the administrator may grant an extension of
the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until
same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is
transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid
unless business is conducted there under within twelve (12) months from the date of notice to
the administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for
such times as the administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his sound discretion.

such insurance and such policy shall further provide that it may not be canceled except
upon ten (10) days' written notice (or more) filed with the administrator.

ropes, other than as leashes; or
(3) If off of the owner's or handler's premises, the animal shall be subject to the person's
immediate control, whether by leash, command or other humane device.
(b) Proper enclosures for canines:
(1) Enclosures for canines, adult and juvenile, shall be a fence or structure of sufficient
height and construction to prevent the animal from leaving the owner's property. The
fence or structure must be in good repair and fit to ground level or a fabricated
structure that prevents the animal from digging out. Gates and doors must fit properly
and must be locked or secured by a latch that prevents the animal from opening the
gate or door.
(2) Property enclosed by a buried wire which produces a signal received by a device
attached to a collar worn by canine which prevents the animal from leaving the
property of the owner will be considered a proper enclosure, provided the device and
signal are working and the animal does not leave the property unrestrained. Such
§ 3-23 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 224
property must be clearly marked with a sign and the sign must be posted next to the
driveway or entry to the property. This type of enclosure must contain proper shelter

resulting in the animal's suffering, the animal may be removed and cared for at the owner's
expense. If the animal's condition precludes reasonable relief of its suffering, the city may
euthanize it. In this event, the city need not wait the five (5) days required above. Where
practicable, the city shall notify the owner prior to euthanasia. The animal shall be returned

living area for any animal being kept. The area shall be free of accumulated waste and
debris to the extent that the animal can walk or lie down without coming in contact
with any such waste or debris. All such shelter or living areas must be cleaned and
maintained regularly to provide for the proper health of the animals being kept.
(2) All living areas shall be constructed and maintained to promote drainage of rainwater
to prevent the accumulation of mud and/or water.
(3) Shelters shall be constructed to protect the animal from precipitation and of a material
which provides insulation from temperature extremes. In addition to the shelter, a
shaded area shall also be provided by means of trees or other structures, e.g., awning.

person duly authorized and licensed.
(e) A chain, leash or similar restraint used to maintain a dog under the immediate control
of the owner or handler when the animal is outside the premises in which the animal is
otherwise kept, shall be designed and placed to prevent choking or strangulation.
(f) The securing of a dog by a chain, rope or similar equipment (hereafter referred to as
chain) used as a means of restraint on the premises where the dog is usually kept, i.e., the
home of the owner or handler, shall not be less than ten (10) feet in length and must be used
in conjunction with a swivel or a chain run. No portion of the chain that is entangled shall be
included in the ten (10) feet minimum length.
(1) Provided, that not later than February 1, 2005, no dog shall be secured by a chain that
is anchored at only one (1) location, anchoring that restricts the animal's movement to
a circle around a single anchor the radius of which is determined by the effective length
of the chain. Beginning on that date, all chains securing a dog shall be connected to a
chain run by means of a wire or other fixture anchored at two (2) locations not less than
ten (10) feet apart, an arrangement that allows the animal to run along either side of
the wire the distance of the anchored wire plus the minimum ten (10) feet length of the
chain beyond each anchor. This arrangement permits far greater exercise than merely
circling a single anchor the radius of the chain.
(2) This prohibition of the single point chain does not apply to the owner or handler who
keeps his or her dog in the home or in a complaint enclosure, but who, for exercise,
personal break or other appropriate need, temporarily secures the animal by a chain
for a time not to exceed eight (8) hours in any twenty-four-hour period.
(g) Chickens, ducklings or rabbits younger than eight (8) weeks of age may not be sold to a
single purchaser in quantities of fewer than twelve (12).

immediately, render such assistance as may be reasonably and safely given and report such
injury or death to the animal's owner if known, or to the city.
(i) No person shall knowingly place any poisonous substance so that the poison is likely to
be eaten by any animal. Utilization of commercially prepared rat poison in the manner for
which it is intended is not a violation of this section.
(Ord. No. 04-027, §8, 11-18-04)
Sec. 3-29. Keeping of wild animals prohibited.

BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS § 4-122
Supp. No. 10 285
The following language is added to the text provided in the corresponding section of the
printed code:
§ 302.2.1 Premises not covered by subdivision regulations or ordinance governing
construction on individual lots. Each individual lot [premises] located within approved
subdivisions for which final plat approval has been given, but for which a building permit
has not been issued, shall be subject to the following:
§ 302.2.1.1 Requirements where subdivision regulations previously applied. If the
premises are disturbed as a result of subdivision development preparation, sediment
and erosion control measures required by the subdivision regulations, § 1100, B, 1,
shall have been in place at the time of the final subdivision plat approval. Until such
time as a building permit is obtained for construction on an individual lot(s) within
the development, the soil stabilization required for final plat approval and erosion
and sediment control measures required under the subdivision regulations shall be
maintained. No grading shall be performed within any development subsequent to
final plat approval and before the issuance of a building permit for individual lots. At
such time as a building permit is obtained for construction on the individual lots,
City of Georgetown Ordinance 2002-002 shall apply.
§ 302.2.1.2 Requirements for undisturbed lots. Premises require no special
sediment and erosion control measures where vegetation on those premises is
sufficient to preclude erosion and sediment creation measures. Premises on which
vegetation is disturbed to the extent to which a substantial risk of erosion and
sediment is created shall comply with the standards provided by City of Georgetown
Ordinance 2002-002.
§ 302.2.1.3 Standard by which compliance is determined. If no building permit is
obtained for construction on the premises, the erosion and sediment control
measures required under the subdivision regulations shall be maintained until such
time as vegetation is sufficient to eliminate erosion and sediment creation. The
premises' compliance with this section shall be certified in writing by the office of
building inspection. This certification signifies only that the premises were compli-
ant at the time of the inspection and does not satisfy the requirement of continuing
compliance.
Section 302.4 is omitted and the following language substituted in its stead:
§ 302.4 Weeds.
a. Legislative Purpose. The city acknowledges the desirability of permitting and
encouraging the preservation and restoration of natural plant communities in urban,
suburban and rural areas. It further acknowledges the need to enjoy and benefit from the
variety, beauty and values of natural landscaping, including freedom from toxic chemicals,
and seeks to guarantee its citizens the freedom to employ natural landscaping as a viable
and desirable alternative to conventional modes of landscaping.
§ 4-122 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 10 286
There are a limited number of plant species that constitute serious agriculture pests,
which in some instances may adversely affect human health or safety. Further, this
section promotes the use of native vegetation, including native grasses and wildflowers, in
managed yards and landscapes for the preservation and restoration of our natural plant
communities. This section does not promote the use of plants otherwise designated by
state law to be noxious, e.g., Johnson grass, giant foxtail, Canada and nodding thistles,
multiflora rose, wild cucumber, black nightshade, kudzu, or poison ivy, sumac or oak. The
presence of these plants, though not per se prohibited, constitute evidence of untended,
rank or unmanaged vegetation, a violation of this section.
The use of wildflowers and other native plants in managed landscape design can be
economical, low-maintenance, effective in soil and water conservation, and may preclude
the excessive use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. The city notes that native
vegetation and native plant communities, on a worldwide basis, are disappearing at an
alarming rate. It is desirable to permit and encourage managed natural vegetation within
the city limits while maintaining public health and safety protections.
§ 302.4 A. Definitions. Definitions applicable to the interpretation and enforcement of
section 302.4:
Untended, rank or unmanaged vegetation: Overgrown vegetation or vegetation in an
unhealthful condition, which provides either a direct health hazard or a demonstrated
breeding ground for fauna known to create a safety or health hazard, e.g. rodents, snakes,
mosquitoes. Untended, rank or unmanaged vegetation is a public nuisance.
The presence of untended, rank or unmanaged vegetation exceeding ten (10) inches in
height is a violation of this section.
Conventional yards, which if regularly mowed, appear well managed and are comprised
of many plants other than grass. There is also an abundance of chicory, dandelions,
crabgrass, and numerous other vegetation. For this reason, the conventional yard is
included in the definition of

primarily of grass

or

untended, rank or unmanaged
vegetation.

The conventional yard, however, will not constitute a violation of this section
unless the height of the yard exceeds ten (10) inches.
Managed vegetation: Managed vegetation is vegetation utilized in a planned/designed
yard or landscape, including natural landscaping, with the intent to control, direct, and
maintain the growth of natural vegetation according to its natural characteristics and
reduction, if not elimination, of fauna known to create a safety or health hazard. Managed
vegetation is not subject to the ten (10) inches height restriction.
§ 302.4 B. Declaration of Nuisance and Prohibition. Untended, rank and unmanaged
growth of vegetation on any property within the city, which is visible from any public way,
street, sidewalk or alley or from any adjoining property, is declared a public nuisance.
Such vegetation is prohibited and may be abated in accordance with the procedures
referenced below.
BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS § 4-122
Supp. No. 10 286.1
§ 302.4 C. Natural Landscaping Protected. No agents or employees of the city shall
undertake to enforce this section or issue an order directing the destruction or removal of
any native vegetation, including native grasses and wildflowers, in managed yards and
landscapes.
Agents and employees of the city shall enforce this section and issue enforcement
orders directing the destruction or removal of all vegetation in violation of this section,
including, but not limited to all conditions that create a clear and present hazard to public
health or safety, a threat to the agricultural economy, or a harborage for rodents, snakes,
or mosquitoes. All enforcement orders under this section shall be limited to the offending
vegetation, unless general destruction, cutting or removal is necessary to reasonably
eliminate the offending condition.
§ 302.4 D. Managed natural landscaping. It is lawful to grow native and naturalized
plants to any heights, including ferns, wildflowers, grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees, in a
managed landscape. The growing of native or naturalized plants must be obtained and
possessed according to law.
§ 302.4 E. Statement of the city's intention in the enforcement of this section.
A. This section regulating unmanaged and managed vegetation shall be proac-
tively and uniformly enforced and apply to all property within the city limits.
B. Aesthetic judgments shall not be a consideration in determining required
compliance under this section.
C. The city shall promptly notify the property owner of all applicable rights,
including right of appeal.
D. No agent of the city shall enter upon or take action upon private land without
the providing due process of law.
Section 302.10 is added:
§ 302.10 Public ways not to be obstructed. No owner, occupant or person otherwise
responsible for the care and maintenance of premises shall construct, place or otherwise
allow the construction or placement of any item that, in whole or in part, extends beyond
the property line of the premises into space comprising a public way as defined in Section
202, General Definitions. One example of a violation of this section is a basketball goal,
though mounted, whether temporarily or permanently, on the premises, which extends
beyond the property line into the public way (the right-of-way often includes beyond the
curb and sidewalk. All of which is part of the public way).

occupiable workspaces must be maintained according to this section is from October 1 to
April 15.
Section 704.3 is omitted and the following language substituted in its stead:
§ 704.3 Power source.
The owner of premises may continue to use battery-powered smoke detectors if the
premises have a sufficient number of existing battery-powered smoke detectors in
operational condition. Whenever the premises are renovated or otherwise modified in
such a manner to provide accessible installation of primary power to smoke alarms from
building wiring from a commercial source, the premises shall have smoke alarms shall
receive their primary power from the building wiring provided that such wiring is served
from a commercial source and shall be equipped with a battery backup. Smoke alarms
shall emit a signal when the batteries are low. Wiring shall be permanent and without a
disconnecting switch other than as required for overcurrent protection.

violation of the zoning ordinance, the building code, the housing code and other applicable
laws and regulations of the city and that it can be repaired, altered or improved so as to
comply therewith at a cost which is less than one-half of the value of the structure, then the
building official shall issue the permit and simultaneously order the owner or mover to

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 7-1. Regulation of open fires.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the issuance of permits for the
burning of suitable materials under safe conditions consistent with the provisions, below.
(b) Permit issuance. No person shall ignite an open fire without having first obtained a
permit from the local office of fire marshall or the chief of the fire department or his or her
designee. Open fire is defined as the burning of any material that results in the products of
combustion being emitted directly into the ambient air without passing through a chimney
or stack. The permit issued for such a fire shall contain the conditions under which the fire
shall be started, maintained and extinguished.
The city shall charge an open fire permit fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), to defray the cost of
administrating the provisions of this section.
(c) Performance standards. All open fires shall conform to the following standards:
(1) No fire shall be started within fifty (50) feet of any structure. This distance may be
extended by the permit issuing official in the event the proposed fire is upwind of the
threatened structure;
(2) No fire shall be started within one hundred fifty (150) feet of any woodlands;
(3) The permit holder or person designated on the permit shall be present at all times
from the ignition of the open fire until it is extinguished;
(4) Number 1 or 2 diesel fuel and paper are the only permitted accelerants;
(5) The official issuing the permit shall consider the fire's content, location, weather
conditions, immediate area, method of extinguishing, persons available at site and
the experience of the person[s] available. Based upon these factors, the issuing
officer shall determine the size of the fire;
(6) The permit shall be maintained on site at all times until the fire is extinguished;
(7) The official issuing the permit, any law enforcement official and any fire fighting
officer are authorized to order the open fire extinguished at any time he or she
believes the fire poses a threat to persons or property;
(8) No one shall commence burning prior to three (3) hours after sunrise. Burning shall
be completed on the same day as started, no later than three (3) hours prior to
sunset;
(9) The smoke produced by the fire shall not be allowed to cross any road, street, drive
or highway at such height that motorists' visibility is affected;
(10) Brush or other approved waste must be generated or produced on the property on
which the permitted fire is requested;
(11) All applicable regulations of the natural resources cabinet shall be observed;
FIRE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION § 7-1
Supp. No. 10 523
(12) The following materials shall not be permitted in any open fire:
a. Household solid waste;
b. Tires;
c. Petroleum products;
d. Putrescible waste;
e. Hazardous waste;
f. Construction and demolition waste, except untreated wood;
g. Municipal solid waste;
h. Treated wood;
i. Furniture and carpeting;
j. Electrical wiring;
k. Appliances;
l. Animal carcasses;
m. Pesticides, herbicides, or other toxic compounds;
n. Aerosol cans;
o. Plastics; and
p. Any other material, the burning of which under the applicable circumstances,
constitutes a threat to the public safety.
(Ord. No. 99-013, §§ 1—3, 5-20-99)
Sec. 7-2. Hydrant fee.
(a) Establishment of hydrant fee. A fee for fire hydrants shall be charged of all customers,
within the area of the city served by the Kentucky American Water Company (

KyAm

). This
fee shall cover all costs related to the maintenance of fire hydrants within the KyAm service
area. Related costs shall include the city's cost of administering the collection of the fee and
the required remittance to KyAm in satisfaction of all fire hydrant service charges levied for
the provision and maintenance of fire hydrants within the KyAm service.
(b) Calculation of hydrant fee. The fire hydrant fee to be charged customers of the KyAm
service area shall be calculated as follows:
(1) The KyAm annual service charge per hydrant times the number of hydrants in the
KyAm service area yields the amount to be collected from the benefitted residents.
The number of hydrants used in this calculation shall be the actual number of
hydrants in service plus that number reasonably anticipated for installation during
the coming year;
(2) The amount determined in paragraph (1) above, times one hundred two (102)
percent, yields the total income the city must receive to cover the service charge for
all hydrants anticipated during the year in which the established fee is to be
§ 7-1 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 10 524
collected, the expense of administering the collection and payment of funds under
this section, additional funds necessary to offset income lost due to nonpayment of
fee and interim rate increases. In the event the actual experience reveals that one
hundred two (102) percent of the KyAm service charge is not sufficient to cover the
actual costs described above, the city, upon documentation of the insufficiency, may
establish the total required income under this paragraph at greater than one
hundred two (102) percent of the amount determined in paragraph (1) above;
(3) The amount determined in paragraph (b), above, divided by the number of customers
yields the annual amount to be collected from each customer in the KyAm service
area;
(4) The amount determined in paragraph (3), above, divided by twelve (12) yields the
monthly payment to be collected from each customer.
(c) Annual review of hydrant fee. On or before January 1 of each succeeding year after the
effective date of the hydrant fee, the city shall review the fee calculated under subsection (b)
above, making such adjustments as are necessary to maintain the fee at one hundred fifteen
(115) percent of that amount required to cover the anticipated annual cost of the KyAm
service fee for fire hydrants, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(2).
(d) Responsibility for hydrant service charge. The initial responsibility for the service
charge for KyAm hydrants shall rest with the person or entity with whom KyAm contracted
for the installation of the hydrant. The city shall assume responsibility for the service charge
for a hydrant when the hydrant is accepted by the city as part of the public fire protection
system. Hydrants which are installed as part of the public fire protection system shall be
installed pursuant to approved development plans or subdivision plats and dedicated to the
city's use as part of the public fire protection system. The city's acceptance of the dedication
of a hydrant shall occur whenever any structure or part thereof for which a certificate of
occupancy has been issued lies within the hydrant's service area. For purposes of this
section, service area means a circle with a hydrant as the center point and a radius equal to
one-half (1/2) of the minimum distance between hydrants, as required by the applicable
standard adopted by the City of Georgetown. Application for acceptance of a hydrant into the
public fire protection system shall be made to the fire marshal, on a form issued by him or
her. Upon a determination by the fire marshal that a hydrant meets the criteria in this
section for acceptance into the public fire protection service and certification of such to the
city clerk, such hydrant shall be automatically accepted into the public fire protection system
and such acceptance shall not require approval of the city council. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this section, responsibility for hydrants that are or were not intended to be
dedicated to the city as part of the public fire protection system shall remain with the person
or entity with whom KyAm contracted for the installation of the hydrant and such person or
entity's successors and assigns unless specifically accepted by the city council for maintenance
as part of the public fire protection system.
FIRE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION § 7-2
Supp. No. 10 525
(e) Responsibility of Kentucky American Water Company. The Kentucky American Water
Company shall cooperate with the city in the provision of all necessary information related
to the location and number of KyAm fire hydrants within the city's limits and the number
and location of KyAm's customers. KyAm shall include the city's fire hydrant fee on its water
bill to customers within the city's boundaries. KyAm shall remit to the city all hydrant fee
payments collected. The remittance of these payments shall be on or before the tenth day of
each month.
(f) Commencement of hydrant fee payments. The KyAm customers' monthly hydrant
payments shall commence upon the completion of the following:
(1) The calculation of the city's fee as provided above;
(2) Notification to KyAm of the amount to be collected;
(3) The inclusion of the amount to be collected on the KyAm customer water bill; and
(4) If necessary, approval by the public service commission of the inclusion of the city's
fee on the KyAm customer water bill.

ARTICLE I. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
DIVISION 1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND
OBJECTIVES
Sec. 8-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS)
67.083, 83A.130, and 83A.140 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
KRS 151.230 empowers local government to enact administrative regulations for floodplain
management through ordinance. Local Government's participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) assures the Federal Insurance Administration that it will enact as
necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having flood, or flood-related erosion hazards,
adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with
the criteria set forth in Parts 59, 60, and 65 of the National Flood Insurance Program
Regulations (44 CFR). Therefore, the Fiscal Court of Scott County, the City Council of
Georgetown, and the City Commissions of Sadieville and Stamping Ground, Kentucky, hereby
adopt the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 1, § A), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-2. Findings of fact.
(a) The flood hazard areas of Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and
Stamping Ground are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-
proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 1, § B), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and
to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood
height or velocity;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-3
Supp. No. 9 583
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion
or flood damage; and
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 1, § C), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-4. Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood
hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
(7) Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood
hazard area; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for
their actions.

provision of this article or from the floodplain administrator's ruling on a request for a
variance.
AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones means special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood protection system
that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-year or greater level of flood protection.
After restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other
flooding sources.
A99 zone means that part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under construction. No

insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one (1) to three (3) feet,
there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate;
and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Base flood means a flood which has a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this
article.

protection from flooding.
Community flood hazard area (CFHA) means an area that has been determined by the
floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from
available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources,
which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public

floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the
structure, such as building utilities, HVAC components, etc.
Fraud and victimization means as related in division 6, appeals and variance procedures,
of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the fiscal court or city council/commission will consider
the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to
increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community
as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property,
unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.

property was inadvertently included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA amends the
current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a
SFHA.
(2) Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to
manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and
floodway delineations, and planimetric features.
(3) Letter of map revision means based on fill (LOMR-F). A determination that a structure
or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above the BFE and is,

(NGVD) of 1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people
and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect
people and structures, and to minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery.

that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing
criteria in division 5, section 8-52(2) and section 8-54(2);
d. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as
a result of proposed development.
(2) Construction stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction
continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the
permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator and to the state a certification
of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to
mean sea level. In AE, A1-30, AH, and A zones where the community has adopted a
regulatory base flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified
by same.
When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, said certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a certified professional engineer or
architect. Any continued work undertaken prior to the submission of the certification
shall be at the permit holder's risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the
lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected
by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to
make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.

Supp. No. 9 601
d. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of
affected watercourses. For purposes of this article, "adversely affects" means that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
(2) Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with division 3, section 8-32, the floodplain administrator
shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of division 5. Any such information shall be submitted to the Fiscal Court of
Scott County, the City Council of Georgetown, and the City Commissions of Sadieville

DIVISION 5. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 8-50. Expiration of floodplain construction permit—In general.
The Environmental Quality Element of the Comprehensive Plan for Scott County estab-
lishes goals and objectives intended to protect environmentally sensitive areas, including
special flood hazard areas. As a result, the Zoning Ordinance of Scott County defines a
Conservation District in Section 4.2 and the Subdivision and Development Regulations of
§ 8-43 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 604
Scott County set policies for environmentally sensitive areas in Article XII, Section 1200.
These provisions limit development in special flood hazard areas, defined in division 3 of this
article. With the desire to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, Scott County
and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground prohibit new construction and
substantial improvements within the special flood hazard area. As a result, the lowest adjacent
grade of a structure is typically above the base flood elevation and flood-proofing of structures
near special flood hazard areas is not required. Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown,
Sadieville, and Stamping Ground recognize non-conforming structures (see zoning ordinance
sections 2.1 and 2.41) do exist. The following provisions in division 5 are established in the
event new construction and substantial improvements are permitted by variance (see division
6 of this article) within the special flood hazard area. Applicable portions of these provisions
shall also be used when permitting development on parcels of land contiguous to special flood
hazard areas.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-51. General construction standards.
In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
(2) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-
top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and
consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
(3) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with mate-
rials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(4) New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and
practices that minimize flood damage;
(5) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment, and other service
facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if within zones
AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to
guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures;
(6) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system;
(7) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems
into flood waters;
(8) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding;
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-51
Supp. No. 9 605
(9) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is not in
compliance with the provisions of this article shall meet the requirements of "new
construction" as contained in this article;
(10) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is not in
compliance with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if said
non-conformity is not furthered, extended, or replaced.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5, § A), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-52. Specific standards.
In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set
forth in division 3, section 8-32, the following provisions are required:
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than two
(2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of
division 5, section 8-52(3).
a. In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest adjacent grade
to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified in feet on the
FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no
depth number is specified.
b. In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, the floodplain administrator will determine the
method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include, but are
not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data
available from other sources, approximate methods, use of historical data, best
supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. The
lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than two (2) feet above such base flood
elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4,
Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for
a state floodplain permit: the applicant shall provide cross sections for determin-
ing floodway boundaries (and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed
construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be
referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more
than plus five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those
points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend
across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations
specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will
§ 8-51 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 606
not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site
elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory
floodway boundary calculations.
c. In all other zones, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and
verified by the community building inspection department to be properly ele-
vated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain
administrator.
(2) Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes
used for non-residential purposes) shall be elevated to conform with division 5, section
8-52(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
a. Be flood proofed to an elevation two (2) feet above the level of the base flood
elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially imperme-
able to the passage of water;
b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
c. Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork,
elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the level of the base flood elevation;
d. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of
this subsection are satisfied. Such certification along with the design and
operational maintenance plans shall be provided to the floodplain administrator;
e. Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division 5, section 8-52(4);
f. All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be
constructed of flood resistant materials to an elevation two (2) feet above the base
flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings
for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the standards of division 5,
section 8-52(3).
(3) Elevated structures. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated
structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Openings for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding,
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-52
Supp. No. 9 607
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher
than the exterior foundation grade), and
3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings
or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions;
b. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking
of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area
(stairway or elevator); and
c. The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be finished or partitioned
into separate rooms.
(4) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
a. All new and substantially improved manufactured homes placed on sites located
within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation
and anchoring. Locations include:
• On individual lots or parcels,
• In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
• In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
• In substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
• Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, and
• In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a
flood;
All such manufactured homes must be:
1. Elevated on a permanent foundation,
2. Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the level of
the base flood elevation, and
3. Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement;
b. Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of
a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
1. The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that
either the:
• The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than
two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, or
§ 8-52 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 608
• The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less
than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
c. All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE
on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days,
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
3. Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this article, including
anchoring and elevation requirements for "manufactured homes."
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in
accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels
or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(5) Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 3,
section 8-32, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improve-
ments, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical
data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels
during occurrence of base flood discharge;
b. If division 5, section 8-52(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 5.
(6) Standards for utilities.
a. All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate:
1. Infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and
2. Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
b. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or
contamination from them during flooding.
(7) Structures elevated on fill. A residential or non-residential structure may be con-
structed on permanent fill in accordance with the following:
a. The lowest floor (including basement) of the structure or addition shall be no
lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation;
b. The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one (1) foot deep before
compacting and should extend at least ten (10) feet beyond the foundation of the
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-52
Supp. No. 9 609
structure before sloping below the base flood elevation, said slope being no
greater than a 2:1 ratio unless a stability analysis is provided by a registered
professional engineer;
c. The top of the fill shall be no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.
However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies
an alternative method to protect the structure from damage due to erosion, scour,
and other hydrodynamic forces;
d. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties;
e. All new structures built on fill must be constructed on properly designed and
compacted fill (ASTM D-698 or equivalent) that extends beyond the building
walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and has appropriate
protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill or the fill standard must
be approved by a licensed professional engineer; or
f. If the community adopts and enforces the soil testing and compaction require-
ments set forth by the Standard, Uniform, or National Building Codes or the
International Residential and Building Codes, it may qualify for additional CRS
credit.
(8) Vegetative buffer strips (riparian zones). For all activities involving construction within
twenty-five (25) feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
a. A natural vegetative buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty-five
(25) feet of the mean high water level of the channel.
b. Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an
appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of
construction.
c. The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access
through this buffer strip shall be provided for stream maintenance purposes.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5, § B), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-53. Standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or
floodways.
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in division 3, section 8-32, where
streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been
provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
(1) No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special
flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the

Sec. 8-54. Standards for shallow flooding zones.
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in division 3, section 8-32, are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with
base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and
the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall:
a. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base
flood elevation, or in zone AO, the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate
map above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no flood depth is specified,
the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures
shall:
a. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base
flood elevation, or in zone AO, the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate
map, above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no flood depth is specified,
the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood proofed
either to the base flood elevation or above or, in zone AO, to or above the specified
flood depth plus a minimum of two (2) feet so that any space below that level is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in
division 5, section 8-52(2).
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5, § D), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-55. Standards for subdivision proposals.
(a) All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the
base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-55

flood hazards.
(d) In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available, base flood
elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development
(including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
(e) All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure(s) and lowest
adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest
adjacent grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor
and provided to the floodplain administrator.
(f) All new subdivision proposals shall include streets for emergency access that are
elevated at or above flood waters during the one (1) percent annual chance flood (100-year
flood).
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5, § E), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-56. Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with the letter
"A".
For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated "A" the following
provisions shall apply:
(1) Must be non-habitable;
(2) Must be anchored to resist floatation and lateral movement;
(3) Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the standards of division 5,
section 8-52(3);
(4) Must be built of flood resistant materials to two (2) feet above the base flood elevation;
(5) Must elevate utilities two (2) feet above the base flood elevation;
(6) Can only be used for storage or parking; and
(7) Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 5, § F), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-57. Critical facilities.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the
limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be
permissible within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no
feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have
the lowest floor elevated two (2) feet or more above the base flood elevation at the site. Flood
proofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be
displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the
base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

DIVISION 6. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
Sec. 8-61. Nature of variances.
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the article are based on the general principle
of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A
variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that
complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the
property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the
land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the Fiscal Court of Scott County, the City Council of Georgetown, and the
City Commissions of Sadieville and Stamping Ground to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below
flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in
the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met
before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those
situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 6, § 1), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-62. Designation of variance and appeal board.
The Boards of Adjustment for Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville and
Stamping Ground are hereby established as appeal boards. The property location will
determine the appropriate board to hear the appeal.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 6, § 2), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-63. Duties of variance and appeals board.
(a) The variance and appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this article and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain
administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(b) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the variance and appeal board may appeal such
decision to the circuit court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 6, § 3), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-64. Appeals and variance procedures.
In passing upon such applications, the variance and appeal board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this
article, and the:
(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-64
Supp. No. 9 613
(2) Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
(4) Importance to the community of the services provided by the existing or proposed
facility;
(5) Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally
dependent use;
(6) Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to flooding or erosion
damage;
(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain manage-
ment program for that area;
(9) Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10) Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(11) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
water systems, streets, and bridges and culverts.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 6, § 4), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-65. Conditions for variances.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the variance
and appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(1) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
"minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. "Minimum neces-
sary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of the
ordinance from which this article is derived. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the board of adjustment need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the board of adjustment believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
(3) Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
§ 8-64 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 614
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense,
create nuisance (as defined in the definition section under "public safety and
nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition
section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
d. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to
which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being
situated below the base flood elevation.
e. The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
upon request.
f. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and
other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of section 8-64 are satisfied and that
the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public
safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(Ord. No. 13-028, § 2(art. 6, § 5), 1-6-14)
Sec. 8-66. Variance notification.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature
of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage;
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy
of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Clerk
of Scott County and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
(3) The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance or denial, and report such variances issued in the
community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.

Supp. No. 9 615
Sec. 8-67. Historic structures.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see
definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(f) Fiscal surety.
(1) The permittee shall be responsible for the installation, good repair, maintenance and
ultimate removal of all temporary and permanent EPSC measures.
(2) The issuing authority requires the permittee to post a fiscal surety, consisting of a
bond, certified check, performance guarantee or other instrument, acceptable to and
approved by the issuing authority. Fiscal surety for single-family and duplex develop-
ments and addition and/or alteration of existing structures with land disturbance
greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet and less than one (1) acre will be exempt
as determined by the issuing authority when covered by a building permit. When a
fiscal surety is required, the surety shall be posted prior to the issuance of a land
disturbance permit.
(3) The fiscal surety shall be in the amount equal to two (2) times the estimated cost of the
EPSC measures, as approved by the issuing authority, but in no case shall be less than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
(3) Following the period allowed to the permittee to complete the installation of the EPSC
measures, the issuing authority finds the required temporary or permanent improve-
ments or control measures have not been installed or maintained properly or are not
in good repair or functioning properly, then the issuing authority may declare the
permittee to be in default if it does not appear that the improvements or controls will
be completed or repaired within a reasonable time. Upon declaration of default, the
issuing authority shall demand such amounts from the surety as required to remedy
the default. Single-family and duplex developments and addition and/or alteration of
existing structures with land disturbance greater than five thousand (5,000) square
feet and less than one (1) acre will receive a stop work order on the building permit to
remedy the default.
(5) Request for release of surety may be made after the issuing authority makes an
inspection of the property and determines that final stabilization has been established,
and issues a certificate of stabilization. Single-family and duplex developments and
addition and/or alteration of existing structures with land disturbance greater than
five thousand (5,000) square feet and less than one (1) acre will not receive certificate
of occupancy until the issuing authority makes an inspection of the property and
determines that final stabilization has been established.
(g) General permit. Complying with the provisions of this article and issued land distur-
bance permit does not exempt the permittee from obtaining coverage from the Kentucky
Division of Water under the KPDES storm water general permit for storm discharges related
to construction activities. The permittee shall provide proof of approved coverage under
KPDES with the Kentucky Division of Water to the Issuing Authority. When applicable, land
disturbance permits will not be issued until proof of an approved NOI is received by the issuing
authority.
FLOOD PREVENTION § 8-94
Supp. No. 7 620.5
(h) Permit release. Land disturbance permits will be closed once the issuing authority
determines that final stabilization has been established, receives a copy of proof of the not
submittal to Kentucky Division of Water (if applicable), and issues a certificate of stabilization
or certificate of occupancy for project also covered by a building permit.
(i) Relation to other laws. Neither this article nor any administrative decision made under
it exempts the permittee or any other person from procuring other required local, state, or
federal permits or complying with the requirements and conditions of such other permit(s), or
limits the right of any person to maintain, at any time, any appropriate action, at law or in
equity, for relief or damages against the permittee or any other person arising from the activity
regulated by this article.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Secs. 8.5-1—8.5-30. Reserved.
ARTICLE II. SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
Sec. 8.5-31. Findings and intent.
The Georgetown City Council finds that:
(a) Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air
pollution. Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers.
These diseases include heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer. The
National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible
for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually.
(National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and
Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National
Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.)
(b) The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand
smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS),
"Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP,
2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.)
(c) A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana
before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public
places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and
public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease.
(Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of
admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and
after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.)
(d) Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly, individuals with cardiovascular
disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics
and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand
smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death
syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection
Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.)
(e) The Americans With Disabilities Act, which mandates access to public places and
workplaces for persons with disabilities, deems impaired respiratory function to be a
disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with
Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.)

/first/pubdocs/mcc/3/14009_takes_tag_mcc_3_savena
(f) The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and
nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the
exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human
Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon
General. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.)
(g) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot
be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which
are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not
eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.:
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.)
(h) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute
myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco
smoke is nonlinear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as
those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes
a day and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or
with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit
smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible
are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal, 328:
980-983, April 24, 2004.)
(i) A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees
who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) percent to fifty (50)
percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular
disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable
decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas,
J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the
CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.)
(j) Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory
disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health
insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to
secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8),
Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.)
(k) Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling
for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact
after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smoke-free. Creation of smoke-free
workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee
health and safety. (Glantz, S.A.; Smith, L., The Effect of Ordinances Requiring
Smoke-Free Restaurants on Restaurant Sales in the United States. American Journal
of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic
impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco
Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.)

(l) Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on
merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to business health 15(8), Supplement
A: 6-9, August 1997.)
(m) The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a danger to health and a material
public nuisance.
Accordingly, the Georgetown City Council adopts the foregoing as justification for this
article, the purpose of which is:
(1) To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places
and places of employment; and
(2) To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and
(3) To recognize that the public's need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority
over the individual's desire to smoke.

ARTICLE II. EXPLICIT SEXUAL MATERIAL*
Sec. 10-21. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to regulate the direct commercial distribution of certain
explicit sexual materials to minors in order to aid parents and guardians in supervising and

such material may have for minors can adequately be served by its availability to young
persons through their parents or guardians. It is also the purpose of this section to prohibit
open public display of certain explicit sexual materials, in order to protect persons from
potential offense through involuntary exposure to such materials.
(Ord. No. 84-006, § 1, 5-17-84)

For the purposes of this article:

anal intercourse;
(2) Depicts direct physical stimulation of unclothed genitals;

Works of art, however, or works of anthropological significance, or materials when
presented in a program of education in a church, school or college shall not be deemed
to be within the foregoing definitions.
(b) Disseminate shall mean to sell, lease or exhibit commercially and, in the case of an
exhibition, to sell an admission ticket or pass, or to admit persons who have bought

minors are able to see it.

screen, theater marquee, newsstand, display rack, window, showcase, display case or
similar place so that matter bringing it within the definition of "explicit sexual
material" is easily visible from a public thoroughfare or from the property of others.

ground for belief, which warrants further inspection or inquiry of both of the following:
(1) The character and contents of any material described herein which is reasonably
susceptible of examination; and
(2) The age of the person.
An honest mistake, however, shall constitute an excuse from liability hereunder if a
reasonable bona fide attempt is made to ascertain the true age of the person.
(f) Minor shall mean a person less than eighteen (18) years of age.
(Ord. No. 84-006, § 2, 5-17-84)

A person is guilty of a violation of this article if he or she:
(1) Knowingly disseminates explicit sexual material to a minor; or
(2) Knowingly displays explicit sexual material for sale in an area to which minors have
access, unless such material has artistic, literary, historical, scientific, medical,
educational or other similar social value for adults and access to such material is
limited to adults; or
(3) Knowingly places explicit sexual materials upon public display;
or if he knowingly fails to take prompt action to remove such a display from property in his
possession after learning of its existence.

excess of this amount shall be the sole financial responsibility of the developer or a
properly constituted homeowner's association.
(3) All other styles must receive prior specific written approval from the city. Approval

secure the cost of the city's installation of the approved streetlighting plan in the
event of the developer's failure to complete installation according to the plan within
the extension granted above. The city's election to call the developer's bond and to
undertake installation according to the approved plan shall not preclude the filing of
charges in Scott District Court seeking the penalties provided below.

completed no later than forty-five (45) days after the effective date of this article
shall not be affected by the provisions of this article.

a filing with the Internal Revenue Service or the Kentucky Department of Revenue shall be

performed or rendered in the city by every resident and nonresident who is an
employee;
(2) The net profit from business conducted in the city by a resident or nonresident
business entity.
(b) Every business entity engaged in any business in the city shall be required to apply for
and obtain an occupational license from the city before the commencement of business or in the
event of a change of business status. Licensees are required to notify the city of any changes
in address, the cessation of business, or any other changes which render the information
supplied to the city in the license application inaccurate.
(c) Except as provided for in subsection (f) of this section, net profit shall be apportioned as
follows:
(1) For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue within and without the city,
by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor,
described in subsection (d) of this section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection
(e) of this section, and the denominator of which is two (2); and
(2) For business entities with sales revenue within and without the city, by multiplying
the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(d) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid or
payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity for compensation, and the
denominator of which is the total compensation paid or payable by the business entity
everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the
time the individual's service is performed within the city.
(e) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales revenue of the
business entity in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total
sales revenue of the business entity everywhere during the tax period.
(1) The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the city if:
a. The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States
government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the city regardless of the

storage in the city and the purchaser is the United States government.
(2) Sales revenue, other than revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal
property or the lease or rental of real property, are apportioned to the city based upon
a fraction, the numerator of which is the time spent in performing such incomeproducing
activity within the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent
performing that income-producing activity.
(3) Sales revenue from the lease or rental of real property is allocated to the city if the real
property is located within the city.
(f) If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the
business entity's activity in the city, the business entity may petition the city or the city may
require, in respect to all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:
(1) Separate accounting;
(2) The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;
(3) The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will fairly represent the
business entity's business activity in the city; or
(4) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and
apportionment of net profit.

by an employee, both within and without the city, the license tax shall be measured by that
part of the compensation paid or payable as a result of work done or service performed or
rendered within the city. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total wages
or compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's
reported percentages under this subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.
(h) All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income is "passed
through" to the owners are subject to this article. The occupational license tax imposed in this
article is assessed against income before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners.

plated under Section 170 of the Kentucky Constitution and K.R.S. 91.260 and K.R.S.

the proposed manufacturing establishment within the City of Georgetown.

addition to any fine, which may be imposed for the violation;
(4) Any person failing to pay the enhanced fine provided above in this section for parking

not timely paid shall be delinquent. A reasonable penalty may be charged for
late payments. This penalty and all other reasonable charges related to the
city's collection and disposal of solid waste shall be subject to review and
modification from time to time by the city council. All delinquent owners or
residents shall receive a written notice of the overdue payment. Failure to pay
the fee within the time required by the notice, shall result in the disconnection

was rendered. Water service will be renewed at such time as the delinquent
account is made current, together with all reasonable charges and expenses
incurred by the city during cut-off and reconnection of water service. No water
service shall be terminated, however, without written notice to the water

waste disposal system and necessary facilities, the following schedule of fees, rates and
charges for waste collection and removal, is adopted:
(2) The within rates apply to municipal waste only, except where noted. These charges
are subject to adjustment for abnormal volume or conditions:
a. Standard residential Herbie collection. The monthly rate for once-weekly
residential waste collection shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) per dwelling unit for
a single Herbie-Curbie. Customers may request additional Herbie-Curbies for
five dollars ($5.00) per Herbie, per month, with a maximum of three (3) Herbies
per dwelling unit. Additional Herbies requested after the effective date of the

for a minimum of twelve (12) months. Any customer who, within the twelve (12)
months immediately preceding the effective date of this the ordinance from
which this article is derived, paid for an additional Herbie may apply for a
pro-rata refund of the purchase price, provided the customer keeps the Herbie
for at least twelve (12) months from the time the Herbie was originally received.
For example, if a customer purchased a Herbie three (3) months prior to the
effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, customer may
receive a refund equal to three-quarters (3/4) of the purchase price (12-3)/12.
b. Commercial Herbie collection. The monthly rates for commercial Herbie

Herbie
$5.00 $10.00 $15.00 $20.00 $25.00

business. The director of public works shall have the right to limit the number
of Herbies per parcel and, if necessary, to require a particular business or
property owner to obtain private dumpster collection.

of the following types of waste: Offal, sewage, construction and demolition debris,
electronics, appliances (white goods), discarded furniture, tree trimmings except

internet website. At other times, the city may collect such items upon special
collection request to public works. Special collections shall be assessed an additional
charge commensurate with the additional service required by their particular need
in an amount to be determined by sanitation director which will be published twice
a year. The city shall have the right to deny waste collection, removal or disposal
service to any person whose waste requirements exceed the city's capabilities or are
of such nature that the city is without appropriate means for the waste's disposal.
Buildings or dwellings not readily accessible to city public works employees, persons
setting out waste not properly contained or prepared, or users requiring service more
frequently than regularly scheduled, shall be assessed an additional charge com-
mensurate with the additional service required by their particular need.
(4) Reduced residential Herbie rate. Any customer who is at least sixty-five (65) years of
age may request a reduced residential Herbie rate of eight dollars ($8.00) per month

excepted shall use reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of this subsection
when practical.
(6) Unless otherwise specified by in the citation, violations of this section shall be
remedied within twenty-four (24) hours of notice.

violation of this section, upon affording written notice to the property owner or resident of
the city's intent to remove them. The dated, written notice shall be signed by the city
employee delivering it and shall read as follows:


.
For the purpose of this section, service of the above notice shall be complete upon actual
personal delivery to the property owner or resident, or upon posting a true copy of the notice
in a conspicuous place on the owner's or resident's property. Posting the notice[s] on the
offending containers shall satisfy this notice requirement.

Sec. 19-57. Design and installations.
(a) A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except
where one (1) building stands at the rear of another or an interior lot and no private sewer is
available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or
driveway. The sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one (1) building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any
obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single connection
aforementioned.
(b) Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are
found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this article.
Permit and inspection fees for new buildings using existing building sewers shall be the same
as for new building sewers. If additional sewer customers are added to the old building sewers,
additional sewer tap fees shall be charged accordingly even though no new sewer tap is
actually made into the city system.
(c) Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's side of the tap for
delivery of waste from any location other than that of the customer in whose name the tap is
registered shall not be permitted.
(d) The building sewer shall be case iron soil pipe, ASTM A-74, latest revision, PVC
(polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision, or ductile iron pipe, AWWA
specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet requirements of state plumbing code. Joints
shall be as set out hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five (5) feet
of a water service pipe shall be constructed with cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe, unless
the building sewer is at least one (1) foot deeper in the ground than the water service line. Cast
iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe may be required by the city where the building sewer is
exposed to damage or stoppage by tree roots. Cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe shall be
used in filled or unstable ground; in areas where by cover over the building sewer is less than
three (3) feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other external loads.

adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be
restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(h) In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to permit gravity flow to
the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by an approved means
and discharged to the same building sewer. Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary
drainage shall be above basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.
(i) The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the easement or property
line. Where no property located service branch is available, an authorized agent of the city
shall cut a neat hole into the main line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle
installed to receive the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of
connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant to the main line of the public sewer.
A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner surface of the public sewer, shall
be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially
prepared for this purpose. A wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line
between the public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a clean
out and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After testing, a cast iron or
ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground surface. A
stopper or plug, outfitted with a type joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser
against the intrusion of ground or surface water.

sewer is ready for connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the manager or representative. The connections shall be made gaslight and
watertight and verified by proper testing.
(b) All building sewers shall be smoke tested through the wye branch at the public sewer
connection, with public sewer tightly plugged off, after connections at both ends are made and
after all pipe is properly bedded and backfilled at least to top of pipe and if backfill is
completed, within two weeks after completion of backfill. At time of test, any openings into the
building drain inside the building shall be water trapped or plugged. Any leakage of smoke
from building sewer or building drain and plumbing shall be located at test and repaired to
stand repetition of smoke test without leakage. When smoke testing is completed, the
temporary flow line plug shall be removed and a permanent watertight plug shall be placed in
branch of test wye-branch and carefully backfilled by hand and tamped to at least six (6) inches
above the top of the branch.

Sec. 19-65. Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
(a) This article provides for the regulation of all commercial and industrial users of the
municipal wastewater system for the discharge of fats, oils and greases through the fats, oils
and greases (FOG) control program. The GMWSS shall administer, implement and enforce
this program. This program shall be administered to oversee the design, installation,
cleaning, maintenance and proper operation of FOG removal and control equipment in order
to eliminate the obstruction of sewer lines caused by FOG.
(b) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the
GMWSS general manager or his designee, they are deemed necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing any type of floatable grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptor shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of type
and capacity approved by the GMWSS general manager or his designee and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(c) In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal for not less than three (3) years. The
GMWSS may require submittal of reports of such information for their review. Any removal
§ 19-63 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 10 1386
and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's employees must be
performed by a currently licensed waste disposal firm. Interceptors shall also comply with
applicable regulations of the Scott County Health Department and state regulations.
(d) The design and capacity sizing of the interceptor shall be the responsibility of the
owner(s). However, the GMWSS general manager or his designee must approve the final
design and location of the unit. The City's collection system must be provided adequate
protection from prohibited substances and materials traveling through the sewer lines.
(e) Users shall periodically examine the interceptor and update the interceptor if there is
evidence of the unit being too small, worn, broken or otherwise not functioning properly. The
GMWSS general manager or his designee may also inspect the interceptor, in-line grease
removal equipment and any other grease control equipment that the user may use.
(f) The GMWSS general manager or his designee may require the interceptor to be
cleaned on a more frequent basis if there is evidence of problems occurring, such as grease
build-up in the sewer lines. The GMWSS may require the submittal of cleaning reports for
review on a regular basis.
(g) The GMWSS reserves the right to recover any costs associated with cleaning of the
collection system lines from the owner(s) of the interceptor due to failure of the unit for any
reason, including failure to clean and maintain the unit. The GMWSS may also assess
charges and fees as necessary to recover the cost of implementation and administration of
the FOG program.

ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection,
sampling, copying records, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties.
The city, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto their premises, the user shall make the
necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter,
without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
(Ord. No. 11-009, art. VI(N), 11-14-11)
Sec. 19-88. Test procedures.
(a) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where
the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the manager or other parties approved by the EPA
(b) Sample collection procedures. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must
be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling an analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period.
(1) Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater
samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques,
§ 19-86 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 7 1398
unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized
by GMWSS, the samples must be representative to the discharge. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate
EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and
oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by GMWSS, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and
volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compli-
ance reports required in Article VI K 4, 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
(4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the manager may
authorize a lower minimum. For the required by paragraphs Article VI K, 40 CFR
403.12(e) and Article VI K 1, 403.12(h), the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(c) Recordkeeping. Users subject to reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities required by this article, any additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under division 2B
of this article. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed, who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or
GMWSS, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
manager.

pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot meet discharge
limits required by this article. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level required
by this article shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review
of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions
of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

DIVISION 3B. ENFORCEMENT
Sec. 19-106. General.
The city, through the manager or designee, to insure compliance with this article, and as
permitted through 40 CFR Subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following
enforcement steps against users in noncompliance with the ordinance from which this article
§ 19-100 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 7 1402.2
is derived. The remedies available to the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and criminal
penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service and the publishing of
the list of significant violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the
manager or their designee.
The manager may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or an industrial user
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endan-
germent to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit.
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the industrial
user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as
deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall
reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge.Adetailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of the
occurrence.
(Ord. No. 11-009, art. IX(A), 11-14-11)
Sec. 19-107. Notice of violation.
Any user found to be violating any provisions of this article, wastewater permit, or any order

violation(s). Within ten (10) days of the receipts date of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of potential liability for any violation occurring before or after the receipt of the notice
of violation.
If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not adequate, the city's response
shall be more formal and commitments (or schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be
established in an enforceable document. The enforcement response selected will be related to
the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not
achieved expeditiously after the initial action. A significant noncompliance as defined in 19-91,
will require a formal enforcement action.
The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the enforcement response plan.

or persistent violator or who is determined to be a significant violator, shall be ordered to
appear before the city. At said appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the
non-conforming user and an administrative fine assessed. The shall be determined on a
case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity of impact on the POTW, impact
on human health, users economic benefit from the violation, history of violations, good faith of
the user, and shall be a non-arbitrary but appropriate amount.
The administrative order may take any of the following three forms:
(1) Consent orders. The manager or their designee is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall
have the same force and effects as orders issued pursuant to subsection (3) of this
section.
(2) Compliance order. When the manager or their designee finds that an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate the ordinance or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have
been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring and management practices.
(3) Cease and desist orders. When the manager finds that an industrial user has violated
or continues to violate this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, the
manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those

UTILITIES § 19-236
Supp. No. 9 1419
Sec. 19-237. Discharge prohibitions.
(a) Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged
into the stormwater system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to
pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the stormwater
system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this
article unless it is demonstrated that these discharges are significant contributors of
pollutants to the stormwater system and watercourses; water line flushing or other
potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows,
rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated
pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), sump pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, individual
residential washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet land flows, swimming
pools (NOTE: Swimming pool water maybe discharged only if dechlorinated—below
0.1 milligrams per liter (mg/L), which can typically be achieved by discontinuing
chlorination for a minimum of 48 hours), fire fighting activities, and any other water
source not containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the GSQUAD as being necessary to protect public
health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the City of

§ 19-237 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 1420
Sec. 19-238. Suspension of MS4 access.
(a) Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The GSQUAD may, without
prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger
to persons.
(b) Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4
in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City of Georgetown will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the GSQUAD for a
reconsideration or hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the City of Georgetown.
(Ord. No. 14-001, § 1, 1-27-2014)
Sec. 19-239. Industrial or construction activity discharges.

Sec. 19-240. Monitoring of discharges.
(a) Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges
associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
(b) Access to facilities.
(1) The GSQUAD shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulations
under this article as often as maybe necessary to determine compliance with this
article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identifi-
cation and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the GSQUAD.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the GSQUAD ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be
kept under the conditions of a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
UTILITIES § 19-240
Supp. No. 9 1421
(3) Upon notifying the owner or owner's representative, the GSQUAD shall have the right
to immediate access to the property to set up on any permitted facility such devices as
are necessary in the opinion of the GSQUAD to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's stormwater discharge and/or suspected illicit discharge.
(4) The GSQUAD has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment
as necessary. The facilities sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure
their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or
oral request of the GSQUAD and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the GSQUAD access to a permitted facility, as
described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, is a violation of any applicable stormwater
discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the GSQUAD reasonable access to the permitted facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
(7) If the GSQUAD has been refused access to any part of the premises from which
stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community or environment, then the GSQUAD
may seek issuance-of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. No. 14-001, § 1, 1-27-2014)
Sec. 19-241. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by
the use of best management practices.
The GSQUAD identified best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or
facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
stormwater system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal stormwater system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non structural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or maybe, the source of an illicit
discharge, may be required to implement at said person's expense, additional structural and
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity to the extent
§ 19-240 GEORGETOWN CODE
Supp. No. 9 1422
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs are
part of the City of Georgetown Post-Construction Stormwater Manual that is hereby
incorporated by reference as apart of this article. A copy of the Manual is located at, 100 N.
Court Street. This document may be viewed or copied at the city engineer's office at city hall
during normal operating hours.
(Ord. No. 14-001, § 1, 1-27-2014)
Sec. 19-242. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee,
shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris,
and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through-the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become
a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. No. 14-001, § 1, 1-27-2014)
Sec. 19-243. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility
or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information
of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the stormwater system, or waters of the
U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
emergency management agency (EMA) in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the
next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the GSQUAD (City Hall, 100 N. Court Street) within three business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to contain the spill, clear the
pollutants from the MS4, and prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained on site for
at least three (3) years and be made available upon request.
(Ord. No. 14-001, § 1, 1-27-2014)
Sec. 19-244. Enforcement.

activity generating the discharge is taking place.
(d) Notices of violations are the first level of enforcement and do not include a penalty, or
fine. Only one (1) NOV will be issued for an offense before citations are utilized. An offense of
the same nature and the same, adjacent, or approximate location as a previous offense, even
if previously corrected under a NOV, will constitute a second offense to be enforced through a
citation. Offenses enforced through a NOV must be corrected within five (5) calendar days of
the date of issuance or a citation will be issued. The GSQUAD has the right to modify the
timeframe for corrections based on the authorized representative's judgment due to project
conditions.
(e) Citations require that all project work is halted until the discharge is corrected.
Citations shall include a penalty, or fine, for each occurrence and payable to the issuing
authority prior to release.
(1) First citation: Fifty dollar ($50.00) fine.
(2) Second citation: One hundred dollar ($100.00) fine and notice of intent.
(f) Six (6) calendar days after posting a citation, the GSQUAD may issue a notice of intent

The term includes re-subdivision and when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the process of subdivision or to the land subdivided. Any division of land into parcels of less than one (1) acre occurring within twelve (12) months following a division of same land shall be deemed a subdivision within the meaning of this regulation. 
Subdivision, Major: Any subdivision of land for multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, professional, or institutional uses; or into four (4) or more single-family residential lots; or any subdivision of land, including for agricultural or horticultural use, that requires the construction, improvement, extension, or widening of streets or other public improvements; or that requires new off-site utility easements. (Amended by City of Georgetown Ordinance 1999-026, 7/15/1999) 
Subdivision, Minor: 
(1)
 The division of a tract of land into three (3) or fewer single-family residential, non­agricultural lots, including the remainder of the original tract. Such lots shall front on an existing public street, except where a single lot is added behind an existing lot that fronts on such a street, and shall involve no new street construction, widening, or extending of an existing street, or any other major public improvements. 

(2)
 Only one (1) minor subdivision plat may be submitted and approved per parent tract. The parent tract shall be identified as any property in existence at the time of the adoption of this requirement, using the records contained in the Property Valuation 


Administrators Office, the Scott County Clerk’s Office and the Planning Commission 
Office. Subsequent subdivision of such property shall be classified as a Major Subdivision, regardless of the number of lots, and require the submission of a Preliminary Subdivision Plat in accordance with Article III. (Amended by City of Georgetown Ordinance 1999-026, 7/15/1999) 
The following are also classified as a minor subdivision:  a subdivision for the purpose of the transfer of land between adjacent property owners and not involving the creation of any new lots or building sites; a subdivision for the purpose of enlarging the size of any previously subdivided lot or parcel of land; the consolidation of up to five lots of record to create a lesser number of parcels and involving no new public improvements; five or less condominium units of previously built developments; and technical revisions to a recorded final plat of an engineering or drafting nature or similar small discrepancy, but not including the altering of any property lines or public improvement requirements.

Urban Service Boundary: That area designated as such in the Comprehensive Plan, planned to be the limitation of future urban development and urban services. 
Use: Use broadly refers to the activities which take place on any land or premises and also refers to the structures located thereon and designed for those activities. 
Variance: A departure from the strict conformance with the dimension and area regulations which must first receive the approval of the Board of Adjustment. 
Variance, Dimensional: Departure from the terms of the zoning regulations pertaining to height or width of structures and size of yards and open spaces where such departure will not be contrary to the public interest, so long as surrounding property owners are not damaged or the character of the neighborhood is not changed, and where owing to conditions peculiar to the property because of its size, shape or topography and not as a result of the action taken after the adoption of the original Zoning Ordinance in 1958, the literal enforcement of its zoning regulations would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. Financial disadvantage to the property owner shall not necessarily constitute proof of unnecessary hardship within the purpose of zoning. 
Yard: The open space surrounding the principal building on any lot, unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of that building from the ground to the sky except where specifically permitted by this Zoning Ordinance.  Yards are further defined as follows: 
A. 	Front Yard: That portion of the yard extending the full width of the lot and measured between the front lot line and a parallel line tangent to the nearest part of the principal building, which line shall be designated as the front yard line. 
B. 	Rear Yard: That portion of the yard extending the full width of the lot measured between the rear lot line and a parallel line tangent to the nearest part of the principle building. 
C. 	Side Yard: Those portions of the yard extending from the front yard to the rear yard and measured between the side lot lines and parallel lines tangent to the nearest part of the principal building. 
Wetland: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 

2.2 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 
All existing and future structures and uses of premises with Scott County and incorporated areas shall conform to all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Each zoning district is established to permit only those uses listed as permitted, except as provided under the non-conforming or conditional use provisions, and is intended for the protection of those uses.  No other uses are permitted. 

2.3 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 
2.31 COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 
In all cases where the ownership of land is divided for the purpose of eventual development of lots of any kind--residential, commercial, or industrial--the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations, heretofore adopted for Scott County and incorporated areas and amendments thereto, shall apply in addition to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. 
It is desirable that access points to the arterial streets serving all zoning districts shall be located no more frequently than one every eighth to quarter mile. Topography and traffic volumes shall determine the exact locations.  Heavy arterial traffic volumes demand greater access spacing.  Along any arterial street where subdivided land and its minor streets are sufficiently developed to permit acceptably spaced access points, the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission (hereinafter known as the Planning Commission) may approve the platting of temporary access points which shall be eliminated by the developer when minor streets or marginal access streets are extended to the approved permanent access points. Such requirements shall be listed as special conditions on the recorded final plat. Access points shall also meet federal and state standards where applicable. 
2.32-I 	PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REGULATIONS (PLANNDED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS) 
A planned-development project may be allowed in those zoning districts where it is designated as a permitted use under the zoning district regulations.  (A minimum of five acres is required for a planned-development project). A planned-development project may depart from literal conformance with individual lot dimension and area regulations. A planned-development project may be under single or divided ownership. All planned-development projects shall be subject to the following regulations: 
A. 	Procedure: When a planned-development project is proposed, the procedure for subdivision approval as set forth in the Georgetown-Scott County Subdivision Regulations shall be followed in its entirety even though the ownership of land may not be divided. A preliminary plat and final plat, both approved by the Planning Commission, shall be required for every planned-development project. The Planning Commission may establish a schedule of reasonable fees to be charged for plat review. The project shall be developed according to the approved final plat. Building permits and certificates of occupancy shall be required for each building according to Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
B. 	Uses and Densities: The uses of premises and development densities in a planned-development project shall conform to the permitted uses and densities of the zoning district in which it is located.  If a planned-development project is proposed which included uses or densities that are not permitted in any zoning district, the project may be permitted after approval by the Planning Commission. 
C. 	Standards: In any planned-development project, although it is permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual lot dimension and area regulations, there shall be no diminution of total equivalent lot area, parking area and loading and unloading area requirement that would be necessary for the equivalent amount of individual lot development with one exception; the Planning Commission may allow reductions in these requirements if the developer can satisfactorily prove that large scale development may permit such reductions without destroying the intent of these regulations. 
D. 	Special conditions:  The Planning Commission shall attach reasonable special conditions to ensure that there shall be no departure from the intent of this Zoning Ordinance. The planned-development project shall conform to all such conditions.  Because a planned-development project is inherently more complex than individual lot development and because each such project must be tailored to the topography and neighboring uses, the standards for such projects should be flexible. The Planning Commission shall attach special conditions based on all of the following standards in addition to imposing the standards for total area, parking area, and loading and unloading area defined in Paragraph C above.  The Planning Commission may also attach any other reasonable special conditions. 
E. 	Assisted Living Facilities shall be permitted as part of a Planned Unit Development within area comparable to the respective districts noted in Section 2.54.C.  Note: These areas that contain Assisted Living Facilities may also reasonably contain attached or separate Nursing Home (Rest Home) Facilities, Elderly Apartment Building(s), and duplexes for the elderly or single family residences for the elderly. 
2.32-II CONDOMINIUM REGULATIONS 
Condominiums are permitted in all districts where attached buildings are permitted, and are permitted in approved P.U.D.'s when designated. Condominium developments shall follow the procedure as established in the Subdivision Regulations and as established for P.U.D.'s. 
The Planning Commission shall act upon condominiums in the same manner as for P.U.D.'s except that the overall density requirement is derived from the particular zoning district. Some variation from these regulations may be permitted by the Commission when the development is of a non-residential nature. 
The Commission may, as a condition of approval, attach special requirements to insure general conformity to the Comprehensive Plan or to the municipal ordinance or county resolutions and to insure adequate maintenance of the development. 

2.33 	CONDITIONAL USE REGULATIONS Conditional uses may be permitted in districts as designated under the zoning district regulations but only when specifically approved by the Board of Adjustment. Planned development projects and subdivisions, when permitted as conditional uses, shall be subject to the respective regulations governing their approval.  All other conditional uses shall be subject to the following regulations: 
A. 	All Districts:  The following conditional uses only may be approved in all zoning districts: 
1. 	
Non-local public utility and private transmission lines and pipes. 

2. 	
Radio, T.V., and telephone transmission structures. 

3. 	
Large utility structures and public service buildings. 

4. 	
Expansion of railroads and appurtenances. 

5. 	
Government buildings and uses. 

6. 	
Churches, libraries, educational and recreational facilities. 


B. 	Specified Districts:  Other conditional uses may be approved only in those zoning districts where they are designated as conditional uses under the zoning district regulations. 
C. 	Procedure:  In applying for a conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit a plan to the Enforcement Officer and follow all procedures set forth in Paragraph 5.24, procedure for building permit application. The Enforcement Officer shall refer the application to the Board of Adjustment. The Planning Commission may establish a schedule of reasonable fees to be charged for conditional use permits.  The applicant shall meet with the Board of Adjustment which may attach reasonable special conditions to an approval of a conditional use to ensure that there will be no departure from the provisions and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. These special conditions may be similar to the conditions that may be required for a planned development project. Effect of the conditional use on surrounding uses and all officially adopted plans shall be approved or disapproved. The Board of Adjustment may approve the application and may issue written authorization to the Enforcement Officer to insure a building permit in full conformance with Section 5.2. The conditional use, if approved, shall conform to all attached conditions. 
D. 	Other Regulations:  Payment of a fee may be required of the applicant before the issuance of the conditional use permit. Other regulations for conditional use permits are as follows: 
25 
1. 	
The Board may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes and in the conditional use permit along with reference to the specific section on the zoning regulations listing the conditional use under consideration. The Board shall have the power to revoke conditional use permits or variances for non-compliance with the conditions thereof. 

2. 	
Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all the requirements of this ordinance and other ordinances and regulations of the pertinent legislative body. 

3. 	
If a conditional use permit has not been exercised within one (1) year from the date of issuance within the meaning of KRS 100.237 a public hearing may be called to revoke said permit. 

4. 	
The Enforcement Officer shall review all conditional use permits except for those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying with all conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the Enforcement Officer shall report the fact in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment.  Upon hearing the report as required by KRS 100.236, if the Board finds that the facts alleged are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the dates of the report and the date of the hearing, the Board may authorize the Enforcement Officer to revoke the conditional use permit and to take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity. 

5. 	
Bed and Breakfasts allowed in R-2, R-3, and Historic zones shall be reviewed for adverse visual impact on neighboring residential properties resulting from the required off-street parking.  Upon a finding that adverse visual impact will occur, the Board of Adjustment shall require screening to mitigate the adverse visual impact. 

6. 	
Approval of a conditional use permit for a Bed and Breakfast shall not be given where the proposed use would require the modification of the building exterior in a manner inconsistent with the single-family character of the house and the character of the surrounding neighborhood. 

7. 	
Bed and Breakfast shall be allowed as a conditional use in all unincorporated areas regardless of zone classification. 


26 
(Sections 2.33 D. 5, 6, and 7 added 5/2/91) 
2.4 	GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR STRUCTURES AND USES 


2.41 	NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES 
Non-conforming structures may remain subject to the following regulations: 
A. 	Alterations:  A non-conforming structure shall not be enlarged, replaced, or altered except in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance. Any structure, however, may be restored to a safe condition if declared unsafe by the Enforcement Officer or other official with jurisdiction, except as provided in B. 
B. 	Any structure containing a non-conforming use which has been damaged to the extent of 55% or more of its then actual value, exclusive of foundations, shall not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformance with this Ordinance; and in the event that the Building Inspector's estimate of value or damage is not acceptable to the applicant, the extent of damage and actual value shall be determined by a Board of three arbitrators; one to be named by the County Judge, one by the applicant and one by the first two named. 
C. 	Construction Approved Prior to Adoption or Amendment of the Zoning Ordinance: Proposed structures for which building permits have been issued prior to their designation as non-conforming by the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance may be completed and used as originally intended provided that they are completed and in use one year after the date on which the building permit was issued, except that signs over public property are not affected by this provision. 

2.42 	NON-CONFORMING USES Non-conforming uses may be continued subject to the following regulations: 
A. 	Extensions: A non-conforming use shall not be moved to occupy any portion of the premises, either land or a structure which was not originally occupied by the non-conforming use. 
B. 	Discontinued:  No non-conforming use may be re-established after it has been discontinued for twelve months. Vacating of premises or buildings of non-operative status for such period shall be evidence of a discontinued use. 

2.43 	LOT OF RECORD MAY VARY FROM REGULATIONS 
When a lot which is an official lot of record at the time of adoption of this resolution does not comply with the area yard, or other requirements of this resolution, an application may be submitted to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from the terms of this resolution in accordance with the procedure outlined in Section 5.4, BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. Such lot may be used as a building site, provided that in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment, the yard and other requirements of the district are complied with as closely as possible. 
2.44 	APPROVED WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL FOR BUILDING 
All subdivision, buildings and mobile homes shall be provided adequate water supply and sewage disposal as herein provided as approved by the County Health Department and appropriate water district. Proposed developments involving ten (10) lots or more, where overall density is less than five (5) acres per unit shall be connected to approved community sewage facilities. 
When septic tanks are used, or proposed to be used, no more than five (5) dwelling units (or equivalent) will be permitted to drain into the same general area, or ultimately, into a sinkhole. The Planning Commission shall investigate, or shall have investigated, topographic contours, soils, type and extent of effluent, and if necessary, geologic conditions in determining what constitutes the same general area. 
Sinkholes shall remain undisturbed and silt-free in any development.  Septic tanks eventually draining into a sinkhole shall not be located closer than 500 feet from the lower surface elevation of such sinkhole. 
Evidence of Health Department approval of proposed or completed water and sewer facilities shall accompany all applications for building permits and certificates of occupancy. 

2.45 	REGULATION OF PRINCIPAL BUILDING 
Unless a plat has been approved for a planned development project, only one principal building and permitted accessory structure may be erected on any lot of record or any conforming lot. Temporary structures are permitted during construction only. 

2.46 	REGULATION OF ACCESS TO ARTERIAL HIGHWAYS 
A. 	It is desirable that access points to all arterial streets shall be located no more frequently than one every eighth to quarter mile. The Planning Commission may approve the platting of temporary access points in conformance with Section 2.31 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
B. 	Wherever there is an abrupt change in uses, e.g., residential to commercial, it is desirable that a buffer area of open space or protective planting be placed between them which will protect each use from the undesirable effects of the other. 
C. 	Parking and other public areas used at night shall be adequately lighted and private areas and/or residential areas shall be adequately protected from such lighting and any other lighting from public areas. Public streets may also require protection from excessive glare of lighted areas. 
2.5 	SPECIFIC USE REGULATIONS 
2.51 	QUALIFIED MANUFACTURED HOUSING, MANUFACTURED HOUSING AND MOBILE HOMES 
2.51.1 For the purpose of these regulations, four basic types of mobile homes development have been defined. They are: (1) mobile homes parks; (2) mobile home subdivisions; (3) mobile home camps (or trailer parks); and (4) a mobile home on a single lot and solid foundation.  All such uses shall conform to all 
applicable provisions of KRS 219.120 through 219.250, as amended, all provisions of this ordinance, and all attached special conditions. 
A. 	Mobile Home Parks and Mobile Home Subdivisions:  May be permitted as a conditional use only in R-2, R-3, and B-2 districts. Mobile home camping areas may be permitted by conditional use in B-2 districts or as accessory uses in recreational areas. All mobile home parks shall be subject to the standards of development established in the Subdivision Regulations. A plat plan shall be submitted to the Enforcement Officer who shall review such plan to see that the following information at a minimum is shown: 
1. 	
Name and address of applicant and/or owner. 

2. 	
Name, location and size of Mobile Home Park. 

3. 	
Approximate dimensions and locations of lots (also numbered), roads and pavement, easements, parks, community buildings, existing buildings to remain, and existing buildings within 200 feet of exterior property lines. 

4. 	
Contour lines at an interval of 10 feet along with existing natural features. 

5. 	
General location of all utilities and method of sewage disposal. 

6. 	
Public or community areas. 

7. 	
Large scale plan of at least one typical mobile home lot showing mobile home location, automobile parking space, minimum yard requirements, etc. 

8. 	
Location of planting for landscaping or buffer purposes when necessary. 

9. 	
Identification of abutting property owners. 

10. 	
Proposed street right-of-way and pavement type and widths along with curb gutter and sidewalk proposals. 

11. 	
Certificates from the County Health Officer. 


When the Enforcement Officer has determined the application for mobile home parks or trailer camps complete, including payment of fees, the application is sent to the Board of Adjustment who shall proceed to consider the application in the same manner as set forth in Paragraph 2.33 and in KRS 100.217 through 100.263. 
B. 	In the case of Mobile Home Subdivision the applicant is expected to meet all of the requirements for preliminary plat approval in his initial application to the Board. Upon preliminary approval of the mobile home subdivision by the Board the application together with any conditions the Board might attach, the application is forwarded to the Planning Commission for Preliminary and Final Plat consideration.  Both bodies must approve the application and act on all variances requested before any site preparation may begin. 
C. 	Mobile homes are permitted in Agricultural Districts and in Conservation Districts on the minimum lot size established for the district unless provisions of Article II, Section 2.1 (2) are applicable. 
D. 	Development Standards for Mobile Homes: The following standards and requirements are minimum standards for the development of mobile home facilities and may be increased at the option of the developer but may be decreased only by approved variances by the Board (and Planning Commission as in the case of subdivisions). 
There are no minimum nor maximum numbers of mobile homes that may be permitted in an approved development, other than density requirements, special conditions that may be imposed by the Board (or Commission when subdividing), or self-imposed limitations that the developer presents.  Development shall be in strict accordance with the plans approved by the Board or Commission, including any and all staged development. 
1. 	
Mobile Home Parks and Mobile Home Subdivisions:  All requirements of the Zoning District in which such use is proposed and KRS shall apply. * 

*Note: This is in keeping with the philosophy that mobile homes should be regulated in the same manner as houses. Therefore, where permitted, mobile home parks, mobile home subdivisions and mobile homes on a single lot are subjected to the same regulations, subdivision and zoning, as single family houses. 

2. 	
Mobile Home Camps (or camping areas for trailers) are permitted as a conditional use only in B-3 districts or as conditional accessory uses in major recreational areas.  Due to the temporary or seasonal nature of this use, special development regulations are necessary. In addition to fulfilling the requirements of KRS 219.120-219.250 as a minimum, the following requirements are to be followed: 

a. 	
The same application, unless changes were granted, that is submitted to the Board of Adjustment, shall be submitted to the Department of Health for their consideration. 

b. 	
The minimum lot for each trailer is 3,000 square feet. 

c. 	
Adequate open space and recreation areas shall be provided in accessible locations. 

d. 	
Accessory commercial uses are permitted, but no closer than 100 feet from the nearest trailer or camping lot. 

e. 	
The layout and lot arrangement shall be such that maximum privacy was an obvious consideration. This may be achieved through landscaping, natural features, radial or alternative lot arrangements, etc. 

f. 	
The surface of the parking area shall be improved, either paved or (8") compacted gravel or as approved by the Board. 

g. 	
All roads shall be improved as approved by the Board. 

h. 	
All lots and streets shall be properly drained. 




E. 	Issuance of Building Permit: The Planning Commission or the Board of Adjustment, if delegated by the Planning Commission, may attach reasonable special conditions to its approval of a mobile home development and may direct the Enforcement Officer to issue a building permit. The Enforcement Officer shall not issue a building permit until he has received written authorization from the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment, and the applicant shall not start construction until he has also obtained a valid construction permit from the State Department of Health as required by Kentucky Revised Statutes 219.150. 
F. 	Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy:  The Enforcement Officer shall issue a certificate of occupancy only after he has determined that the mobile home development has been prepared according to all applicable regulations and special conditions.  The applicant must also obtain a valid permit to operate from the State Department of Health as required by Kentucky Revised Statutes 219.130. 
G. 	Non-conforming mobile homes and mobile home parks: All mobile homes within the county which are non-conforming may continue in their present location as long as the mobile home is occupied by the present occupant. Should the present occupant move elsewhere, the right to maintain a substandard mobile home park shall terminate and the owners shall be required to move the mobile home. 
H. 	Mobile homes in agricultural and conservation districts: the following regulations shall be applicable in A-1 and C-1 districts. 
Mobile homes may be permitted in Agricultural districts and in conservation districts on the lot sizes specified for farm dwellings.

D. 	Step Four: Permits and Application. The applicant will be required to obtain a building permit from the Building Inspection Department. In addition, an application and supplemental materials will be required. The application will include materials such as photographs of surrounding property, site plan, and facade elevation. 
Design and Application Submittal and Review Process 
INTENT: The purpose of compatibility standards for manufactured housing is to permit local governments to adopt and enforce, as a part of its zoning regulations, compatibility standards governing the placement of qualified 
manufactured homes in residential zones, within the local government’s 
jurisdiction. 
1 Refer to definitions (Section 2.1) to clarify between a Qualified Manufactured House and a Manufactured House. 
GUIDELINES: The qualified manufactured home shall be reviewed for its compatibility with architectural appearance and similarity with (1) adjacent development or surrounding developments (i.e. either side of the proposed site within the same block face and adjacent to the rear), (2) development within the same zone or general area, or (3) within a one-eighth (1/8) mile radius or less from the proposed location of the qualified manufactured home. 
ARCHITECTURAL COMPATIBILITY GUIDELINES 
A. 	Facades and Exterior Material Exterior material shall be material customarily used on site-built dwellings, such as board siding, plywood, or press wood siding, non-glossy vinyl siding, stucco, brick, or non-reflective aluminum. 
B. 	Roof Pitch and Material Roofing material shall be of wood, tile or composition shingles, and must have an eave projection of no less than 6 inches. The roof of each proposed unit shall have a pitch at least equal to the average of the two residential buildings in the same block face (residential buildings on either side of the lot, or two nearest residences, if the adjacent structures are not residential). 
C. 	Windows Front facing windows must have consistent size, spacing, and proportion to that of the adjacent residences. 
D. 	Porches Roofed front porches must be included on each structure if more than 50% of the structures in the same block face or within 200 feet of the structure of the subject site, whichever is less, include them. Porches shall equal the average size and must resemble the same architectural style, roof pitch, foundation and façade material of the existing porches within the existing block face. 
E. 	Foundation The structure shall be permanently attached to a permanent foundation system and shall be anchored in accordance with the state standards set forth in KRS 227.550 through KRS 227.590. 
F. 	Size/Height The first-floor elevation of the proposed dwelling shall be no lower than the average floor elevations of the existing adjacent buildings on either side of the infill lot or two nearest residences, if the adjacent structures are non­residential. The building height of the new structure shall be comparable to the building heights within the same block face.

(Amendment adopted 9/22/00 by Scott Fiscal Court) 

2.57 	ADULT ORIENTED USES 
A. 	Purpose of this Ordinance: The purpose of this section is to establish appropriate requirements under which adult oriented uses may locate within the City of Georgetown and Scott County.  It has been demonstrated statistically through verifiable studies in numerous communities that adult oriented uses have harmful secondary effects on the communities in which they locate, particularly when near residential or other areas in which residential, educational, religious and/or recreational uses are permitted. 
B. 	Findings upon which this Ordinance is based: The harmful secondary effects which adult oriented uses have on communities in which they locate include inappropriate exposure of children and teenagers to graphic sexual images, increased incidence in crime, diminished property values, discouragement of other types of commercial activities, discouragement of residential, educational, religious and recreational uses, hereafter referred to as protected uses. The cumulative effect of the location of adult oriented uses, especially in concentration, is a change in the perceived community character and the diminishment of the quality of life or business for the other uses in the neighborhood in which the adult oriented uses are located.  Regulation of adult oriented uses is necessary to reduce the secondary harmful effects of these uses, including, but not 
52 
limited to, the decline of community health and safety and the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and uses.  Regulation of adult oriented uses is also necessary for the integrity of residential areas, schools, churches or other places of worship, libraries, child care centers, parks and playgrounds, all of which are areas in which minors congregate, a segment of the community particularly at risk when in proximity to adult oriented uses. 
C. 	Exclusions from Operation of this Ordinance:  Excluded from this Ordinance are activities which are not for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification, including, but not limited to, the following: Licensed Massage Therapist, as defined in this Ordinance; other persons engaged in massage, e.g. sports massage administered by a team trainer; and artistic studios, photographic or otherwise, utilizing the nude body as a model. 
D. 	Permitted Districts: Adult oriented uses are permitted in B-2, Highway Commercial, and I-1, Light Industry, subject to the general provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision and Development Regulations. 
E. 	Locational Standards: 
1. 	
Distance from residential use: No lot occupied or to be occupied by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any residential zoning district. 

2. 	
Distance from educational, religious and child related use: No lot occupied or to be occupied by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any school, public or private, college, university, church or other place of worship, library, type I day care facility, or any public park or playground. 

3. 	
Distance from agricultural residential use: No lot occupied or to be occupied by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any agricultural zoning district developed or designated for residential purposes, including cluster residential subdivisions or three (3) or more residential tracts as shown on an approved and recorded subdivision plat. 

4. 	
Distance from other adult oriented use: No lot occupied or to be occupied by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a two thousand (2,000) feet radius of any other adult oriented use as defined above. 

5. 	
Method of measure of distances: The distances required by this section shall be measured from the closest property line occupied or to be occupied by an adult oriented use to the closest property line occupied by a protected use, zone district in which an adult oriented use is not permitted, or another adult oriented use. 


53 
F. 	Landscape Requirements: All newly constructed or renovated structures that are used for, or proposed for use as, adult oriented uses shall meet the landscaping requirements set out in the Georgetown/Scott County Landscape and Land Use Buffers Ordinance, including the property perimeter requirements otherwise required in Article 6.12, Section A.2. 
G. 	Effect of Establishment of Protected Use: The establishment of any protected use, zone district in which an adult oriented use is not permitted, or another adult oriented use, subsequent to the lawful commencement of an adult oriented use shall not render the adult oriented use non­conforming. 
H. 	Amortization of Existing Adult Oriented Uses: An existing adult oriented use established prior to the passage of this ordinance shall be deemed a non-conforming use for a period of two years or for the remaining term of the adult oriented use’s lease which is in force at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance, whichever occurs first. For the purpose of this provision, the term of the adult oriented use’s lease shall not include extensions.  At the expiration of the period established in this subsection, the existing adult oriented use established prior to the passage of this ordinance shall comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
I. 	Extension of time for the amortization of existing adult oriented uses: Applications for an extension of the time for compliance established by Section 2.57.9, above, may be granted for good cause shown and must be received by the Office of the Building Inspector, with copy to the Planning Commission Office, not less than 90 days prior to the termination date. The application shall be heard by the Board of Adjustments.

L. 	Operating hours:  No adult oriented use shall be open for business between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. 
M. 	Prohibition of physical contact: While on the premises of an adult oriented use, no employee, agent, servant or independent contractor shall be permitted to have any physical contact with any other adult entertainment employee, other employee, patron or spectator while the employee, agent, servant or independent contractor is entertaining, dancing or otherwise involved in the display of or exhibition of specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities. 
N. 	No act is authorized if not otherwise  permitted by law:  Nothing in this ordinance pertaining to adult dancing establishments, or similar type use, shall be construed to permit or authorize any act or activities that are prohibited by State law. These sections are meant to be in addition to any acts or activities that are so prohibited. 

2.58 GROUP HOMES 
In order to provide reasonable accommodations to unrelated individuals with handicaps or who are elderly, Group Homes shall be permitted as a Conditional Use within the R­1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, and R-3 districts, subject to prescribed use conditions as follows: 
A. 	To avoid clustering and problems created when numerous unrelated individuals live together in single-family dwellings, Group Homes shall not be located on a lot within one thousand (1,000) feet from any other lot containing any such use. This spacing regulation is established, not on the basis of handicap status, but on the basis of the non-family status of the groups. The spacing between these uses shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest point on a lot line of the property containing a use to the nearest point on a lot line of the other property containing a use. To further accommodations to inhabitants of Group Homes, the Board of Adjustment shall, by Conditional Use, reduce or eliminate this spacing requirement upon a finding that the federal Fair Housing Act, as amended, requires it, or that the granting of this Conditional Use shall not be injurious to the neighborhood, or detrimental to the public welfare and will be in harmony with the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance.  In consideration of granting this Conditional Use, the Board shall specially consider: traffic and parking congestions given the capacity of nearby streets, the likelihood that any other applicable group home use will impact traffic and parking congestion, traffic hazards, the availability of off-street parking, the availability of public transit and the likelihood of its use, the feasibility of traffic mitigation measures, and the impact on public utilities, including water and sanitary sewer capacities. 
B. 	Any application for a Group Home which is found to meet the one thousand (1,000) foot separation requirement shall be granted a Conditional Use permit, subject to the remainder of this section. 
C. 	The Board of Adjustment shall not charge any fee for the review and/or granting of any Conditional Use Permit or Conditional Use, including but not limited to fees for providing notices by posting, mailing, and publication, or for review of compliance with spacing requirements. 
56 
D. 	For any Conditional Use granted for the location of a Group Home, the Board of Adjustment shall limit the granting of the Conditional Use to a specified period of time, giving particular consideration to accommodations for financial constraints which may make the establishment of the Group Home impractical and the review of compliance with any conditions the Board may attach. Regardless of the time limitation established, and applicant may apply for subsequent grants of the Conditional Use, extending the Group Home use, which shall not be unreasonably denied. 
E. 	Signs advertising a Group Home are prohibited. 
F. 	In the event that a site, for which no final plat has ever been recorded for, is selected for a Group Home development or cluster of at least three (3) Group Homes, then the separation requirement shall be waived by the Board of Adjustment. 
(Section 2.58 added by Ordinance No. 10-003 within the city limits of Georgetown, 1/25/2012) 

2.59 	TEMPORARY USES 
A. 	Definition: Any use that is temporary in nature and not regulated under any other section of this Ordinance shall require a conditional use permit from the appropriate Board of Zoning Adjustment. 
For the purpose of this section, a temporary use is defined to include uses of ninety (90) days, or less, duration and satisfy one or more of the following: 
1. 	
Uses accessory to a major event, such as the World Equestrian Games, and which serve the needs of that event at an off-site location; 

2. 	
Uses, which include outdoor storage uncharacteristic of the general area; 

3. 	
Uses, which are reasonably anticipated to alter established traffic patterns in the general area; 

4. 	
Uses, which are reasonably anticipated to create significant public health need, such as the creation of substantial on-site sewage uncharacteristic of the general area; 

5. 	
Uses, which require, or serve the personal needs of a substantial number of workers, or service providers, who do not work, or whose services are otherwise uncharacteristic of the general area; 

6. 	
Uses, which otherwise significantly alter the character of the general area; or 

7. 	
Uses, which require substantial construction of facilities, e.g., parking, housing, public health uncharacteristic of the general area; 

8. 	
Uses, which are reasonably anticipated to create significant storm water runoff or silt uncharacteristic of the general area; 


57 
B. 	Procedure: Temporary Uses, as defined above, are conditional uses in every zone, except Downtown Commercial, B-3, and Residential zones. 
1. 	The Board of Adjustment having jurisdiction shall consider temporary uses, as defined above, according to applicable law as 
all other conditional uses. The Board’s action, including its findings 
of fact and conclusions, after hearing on the suitability of a conditional use permit for the operation of a temporary use defined 
above, shall “demonstrate that it has considered the effect of the 
proposed temporary use on the public health, safety and welfare in the zone affected, in adjoining zones and on the overall zoning 
scheme.” 
2. 	
Each of the characteristics above reasonably anticipated to result from the proposed temporary use shall be specifically addressed by the Board.  If the temporary use is approved, that approval shall include specific conditions reasonably anticipated to mitigate the effects each characteristic, e.g., if runoff is reasonably anticipated in conjunction with disturbed land, the Board may impose the condition that silt fencing be installed to bar the escape of silt to adjoining properties. 

3. 	
Excepted from this section are temporary uses otherwise reasonably related to uses characteristic of the general area, e.g., temporary housing, storage, or sanitation facilities for agricultural workers brought to an area for a particular season are exempted from this regulation. The determination of whether a particular activity is an exempt temporary use as defined by this provision is within the discretion of Planning Commission Staff. A determination by Staff that a particular use is, or is not exempt, does not preclude the filing of an application before the Board of 

Adjustment by any interested party seeking a ruling under this section. 

4. 	
Uses that otherwise fall under this Section, but which are anticipated to continue longer than ninety (90) days are governed by the applicable sections of this Ordinance regulating permitted use.

Residential development may vary building setbacks from the street and may show such varied setbacks on subdivision plats. 


2.61 	OBSTRUCTIONS TO VISION AT STREET INTERSECTIONS 
Corner lots in all districts, except the B-3 Central Business District shall be free from all obstruction to traffic visibility between points 70 feet, measured along the street center line from the intersection of the center line. The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit any necessary retaining wall. 
2.62 	FRONT YARD REGULATIONS FOR CORNER AND DOUBLE FRONT LOTS 
Corner lots and double frontage lots shall, on both of the adjacent streets, meet the front yard regulations of the districts in which they are located. 

2.63 	APPLICATION OF YARDS TO ONE BUILDING ONLY 
No part of a yard required for any building may be included as fulfilling the yard requirements for an adjacent building. 

2.64 	USE OF YARDS FOR ACCESSORY BUILDINGS 
A. 	No accessory buildings are permitted in front yards. They are permitted in rear or side yards according to the dimension and area regulations. 
B. 	No building may be erected in the rear of a main building on the same lot to be used for residential purposes, unless approved by the Planning Commission after the submission of an approved development plan. 

2.65 	SCREENING REQUIREMENTS 
The Planning Commission may require a developer or an application for a zoning change, subdivision, conversion, or a building permit to provide proper screening or a buffer zone whenever two different zones adjoin where his actions may be the cause of the land use conflict. 
SEE LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE AND APPENDIX A FOR LANDSCAPE STANDARDS 
2.7 	GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR VEHICLES 


2.71 OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE REGULATIONS FOR AUTOMOBILES 
A. 	Existing Parking Space:  Existing off-street parking provided for any building or use at the time of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance shall not thereafter be reduced unless it exceeds the requirements of this ordinance. Any existing building or use not provided with off-street parking space shall be provided with off-street parking space in conformance with this ordinance at the time of any structural alteration of the building or expansion of the use. 
B. 	Required Off-Street Parking Space: When any building is built or any use of premises is initiated they shall be provided with sufficient off-street parking space on the premises so that they will generate no automobile parking on any street as a result of their normal activity.  If the off-street parking is generated more often than six times during a six-month period, this shall be considered as resulting from normal activity and additional off-street parking shall be provided. The Board of Adjustment shall interpret the amount of parking space required for any building or use, assisted by the following standards, whenever the Enforcement Officer is unable to apply the following standards literally or when he determines a parking space deficiency according to the standards above 
C. 	Off-Street Parking Standards: The following standards comprise the minimum off-street parking requirements for the several common types of buildings and uses listed: 
1. 	
Single family dwelling:  Two parking spaces per dwelling unit. 

2. 	
In multiple-family units: One and one-half parking spaces for each one bedroom unit, and two parking spaces for each two or more bedroom unit. 

3. 	
Indoor retail businesses, and services, and home occupations: One parking space per 150 square feet of commercial floor area plus one space for every truck operated by the business. 

4. 	
Finance, insurance and professional offices: One parking space per 300 feet of floor area used in the conduct of business. 

5. 	
Industrial plants: One parking space for every two employees at maximum employment on a single shift plus one space for every truck operated by the plant. 

6. 	
Places of public assembly, institutions, and recreational facilities: One parking space for every three persons based on maximum capacity. 

7. 	
Additional parking standards: The Board of Adjustment may raise the standards listed above when necessary to conform with paragraph B, above, and shall use similar criteria of floor area, employment, or capacity to interpret standards for buildings and uses not specifically listed above. 

8. 	
Parking space area:  For computing the number of parking spaces in a given area, 400 square feet gross area shall be allowed for each automobile (includes driveways and aisles) and 180 square feet shall be the minimum allowable area for each automobile parking space.  For commercial parking areas and shopping centers, a minimum ratio of 2.2 square feet of parking area for each square foot of gross leasable area shall be provided. 

9. 	
Bed and Breakfasts: In the R-2, R-3 and H-1 zones one parking space shall be provided for each bedroom unit offered for use by the public plus one space for each employee.  This standard may be reduced for existing buildings by the Board of Adjustment upon and finding that on-street parking is not likely to adversely impact the neighborhood and that the character of the neighborhood prohibits the acquisition of land for off-street parking.  New construction shall meet off-street parking requirements. This standard shall be in addition to requirements for any residential use of the property. 


61 
D. 	Because of the concentrated nature of the Georgetown Central Business District, these standards shall not apply unless economically and physically possible. The Board of Adjustment shall decide each case individually. 
E. 	Additional off-street parking standards for specific uses are defined in the Georgetown-Scott County Subdivision and Development Regulations. 
2.72 	OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACE REGULATIONS FOR TRUCKS 
All buildings and uses except those in the Central Business District which generate regular trucking traffic shall be provided with sufficient off-street loading and unloading space on the premises so that they will generate no loading or unloading activity on their required parking spaces or on any street. The Board of Adjustment shall interpret the amount of loading and unloading space required for any building or use whenever the Enforcement Officer is unable to apply this standard literally and applies to the Board for an original interpretation. 

2.73 	ADDITIONAL PARKING, LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS 
A. 	Arrangement of off-street parking space:  Off-street parking space required for any building or use may be located within walking distance of four hundred feet from the premises it serves but detached therefrom or may be consolidated into a large parking area serving other buildings and uses, either of which arrangements must be approved by the Board of Adjustment. The Enforcement Officer shall apply to the Board for an original interpretation when building permits are requested in such cases. The Board may not authorize the total amount of parking space required for all buildings and uses to be diminished except as follows:  if a consolidated parking area serves buildings or uses which do not generate automobile parking at the same times, e.g., churches and stores, total parking space may be diminished to the maximum required by those buildings and uses which do generate parking of automobiles at the same time. 
B. 	Proof of availability:  The Board of Adjustment shall require a plat, deed and any other proof necessary to show that required parking space, is located off the premises it serves, is controlled by and available to the applicant for a building permit. 
C. 	Surfacing of parking, loading and unloading spaces: Parking, loading and unloading spaces and the access thereto shall be surfaced in a manner adequate to eliminate dust and mud, and to eliminate damaging run-off onto abutting or nearby properties. 
2.8 	EXCEPTIONS 


2.81 	USE EXCEPTIONS 
Several types of structures and uses are permitted in all districts even though they are not listed as permitted uses under the zoning district regulations. Others require building permits but not certificates of occupancy. These structures and uses are listed as follows: 
A. 	No building permit or certificate of occupancy required: 
1. 	
Local public utility distributing and collecting structures such as pipes and transmission lines, transformers, meters, etc. Large utility structures such as substations are permitted only as conditional uses.

5. 
Construction or alteration of agricultural structures other than dwelling units in A-1 or C-1 Districts. 



2.82 	HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS 
Height regulations apply to buildings occupied regularly by persons or their activities. They do not apply to structures or portions of buildings such as radio towers, ornamental spires, water towers, silos, and flagpoles which are not occupied regularly by persons except for maintenance unless otherwise stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance. The Board of Adjustment shall interpret whether or not height regulations apply upon application by the Enforcement Officer in doubtful cases.  Federal Aviation Agency height regulations in the vicinity of the airport shall take precedence over all other height regulations. 

2.83 	FRONT YARD EXCEPTIONS 
In any district where the average depth of existing front yards of the nearest existing buildings (within 150 feet in the same block) is greater than that prescribed in this ordinance, the depth of the front yard shall not be less than the average depth of said existing front yard. If there is only one such building within 150 feet, the depth shall not be less than the average depth of such building and the minimum prescribed in this ordinance for the district in which the lot is located.

In A-1S zone only, Automobile Salvage Operations, defined as:  A place of business maintained, operated or used for storing, keeping, buying or selling junked, wrecked, abandoned or inoperative automobiles, vehicles, farm implements or the parts thereof. This term shall not include general scrap metal recycling facilities or general materials storage and re­processing operations; where the following requirements are met: 
1. 	
The proposed storage site must contain no prime farmland or farmland of state-wide importance, as defined by the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture; and 

2. 	
The proposed storage site must have its entrance on a public road and no more than one mile from a primary two-lane road; and 

3. 	
The topography of the proposed storage site must be such that the site is not visible from any roadway or neighboring property. Minimal topographical deficiencies may be corrected with plantings, the design of which must be approved by the Commission as part of the development plan approval; and 

4. 	
The proposed storage site must be removed from all floodplains and property lines a minimum of five hundred (500) feet; and 

5. 	
The applicant seeking approval for an automobile salvage operation must document all sinkholes located within five hundred 

(500) 
feet of the automobile salvage operation and demonstrate that either: 

a. 	
the proximity of the sinkholes to the operation poses no threat to underground water quality, e.g., the sinkhole is located in an area which shall not receive drainage from the salvage operation or that the drainage received by the sinkhole shall not degrade underground water quality.  The applicant's basis for satisfying this requirement shall be valid scientific evidence related to topography, geology, or hydrology; or 

b. 	
proposed engineering of the salvage operation shall prevent any run-off from the operation from entering the sinkholes. 



6.

6. 	
It is recognized that an Agricultural Recreational development can adversely impact surrounding properties and public facilities. Because of these potential impacts, the Commission shall review any proposed Agricultural Recreational development for impacts and impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are necessary to alleviate any adverse impact on surrounding areas and public facilities. Adverse impact on surrounding areas which cannot be alleviated through reasonable conditions of approval shall be grounds for the Commission's denial of a requested zone classification change to A-1R.

b. 	
If the required parking area cannot be provided on the same lot as the principal use, it may be located on a lot within 400 feet of an entrance used by customers or within 1,000 feet of an entrance used by employees. This (these) lot(s) shall be shown on the development plan for the principal use.  In the event the off-premise parking areas are removed or eliminated, or reduced below the required parking standards, the principal use (beneficiary) shall provide either the equivalent number of required number of parking spaces on premise, approved off-premise lot or the principal use shall be discontinued until these conditions are met. A violation of this provision shall constitute an unauthorized and illegal occupancy of the principal use. 

c. 	
All vehicle use areas shall be paved or concrete, no gravel or similar type surface is permitted. 

d. 	
If a principal use, building or development having an insufficient number of parking spaces is increased by 50 percent or less (building area), additional parking spaces shall be provided only for that addition.  For increases greater than 50 percent, sufficient parking spaces shall be required to bring the total development into compliance. The Planning Commission may require the applicant to bring the 




99 
total development into compliance if it is determined that numerous building additions have been proposed in order to bypass this requirement. 
e. 	On sites with multiple tenants, the required parking shall be calculated based on the total number of spaces required for each use. The total number of parking spaces required may be reduced if the uses operate on varying, non-overlapping schedules and sufficient parking can be accommodated. The Planning Commission shall review and approve all such applications. 
K. 	Environmental Standards

ARTICLE V 
ADMINISTRATION 
5.1 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER 
The Fiscal Court and the cities of Georgetown, Stamping Ground and Sadieville shall designate and appoint an Enforcement Officer or Officers who may be members of the Commission, who shall be charged with and provided with the authority to enforce the ordinances, regulations and orders of the Planning Commission and to issue building permits and certificates of occupancy.  The Enforcement Officer in the performance of their duties and functions, may enter upon any land and make examinations and surveys that do not occasion damage or injury to private property. 

5.2 BUILDING PERMITS 
5.21 REQUIRED PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION OR ALTERATION 
It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for or the construction of any building, including accessory buildings, or to commence the moving or alteration of any buildings, including accessory buildings, until the Building Inspector has issued a building permit for such work.  The Planning Commission may establish a schedule of reasonable fees to be charged for the issuance of building permits. 
Permanent electrical, plumbing or fuel connections shall not be installed in a structure to be occupied (including mobile homes) until a valid building permit is issued by the Building Inspector.  Any person or corporation violating this provision is subject to penalties provided in Section 5.6 of this ordinance. 
No building permit shall be issued in any subdivision or development which is not in substantial compliance with all requirements of the subdivision regulations, the final subdivision plat with all construction documents or the final development plan.  Lot owners or contractors representing lot owners in subdivisions who acquired title to their lots prior to the determination of the existence of a substantial non-compliance, shall be exempt from this prohibition. No building permit, however, shall be issued to a developer of a subdivision or his or her agent while there exists a substantial non-compliance in that subdivision. 
At such time as the determination is made of the existence of substantial non­compliance, Notice stating the fact of that determination and the agency and number to call for information concerning the nature of the non-compliance and the steps necessary for its correction shall be posted conspicuously at the entrances to the subject subdivision.  The Notice shall also be recorded on the margin of the Final Subdivision Plat and in a Certificate of Land Use Restrictions in the office of the County Clerk. 
Substantial non-compliance with the requirements of the final subdivision plat or final development plan is defined to include the situation wherein the developer was in compliance at the time the final plat or plan was approved, but through alteration or change to the subdivision or development site, whether by intentional act or through lack of appropriate maintenance, the site, at the time of the building permit request, is no longer as approved on the applicable plat or plan. 
(Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 added 7/22/92 by City of Georgetown, 8/5/92 by Scott Fiscal Court) 

5.22 	EXCEPTIONS 
No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be required in the following cases: 
A. 	Recurring maintenance work regardless of cost. 
B. 	Installation of required improvements according to an approved preliminary subdivision plat or planned development. 
C. 	Those structures and uses exempted by Section 2.8. 
D. 	Construction or alteration of Agricultural structures other than dwellings in A-1 or C-1 districts. 

5.23 	PROCEDURES 
A. 	Application: In applying to the Enforcement Officer for a building permit, the applicant shall submit a plan along with the application, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the outside dimensions of all structures to be constructed or altered and all existing structures, the use of all structures, yard depths, necessary screening where zones meet and any other information necessary for determining conformance with the Zoning Ordinance. The County Health Officer's certificate approving proposed water and sewage facilities must accompany applications according to paragraph 2.44 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
B. 	Permanent File: The Enforcement Officer shall keep a permanent file of all applications with accompanying plans and permits issued. 
C. 	Issuance: If the proposed construction or alteration conforms with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable ordinances, regulations, and codes, the Enforcement Officer shall issue a building permit authorizing such construction or alteration.  If the proposed construction or alteration fails to conform, the Enforcement Officer shall refuse to issue a building permit and shall deliver written notice to the applicant stating the reason for the refusal.  The Enforcement Officer shall act upon the applications for building permits within ten days from the date of their submission. 
D. 	Duration:  A building permit or variance shall become void six months from the date of issuance unless substantial progress has been made by that date on the construction or alteration authorized therein. A building permit may be renewed before it becomes void. 
5.3 	CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY 
5.31 	REQUIRED PRIOR TO OCCUPANCY, CHANGE OF USE, AND UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS 
Except for agricultural building in A-1 and C-1 Districts, it shall be unlawful to use any newly erected or altered structure, or to change the use of any premises even though no structure was erected or altered until the Enforcement Officer has issued a certificate of occupancy authorizing such use, except as specified in Sections 2.8 and 5.22 of the Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may authorize the Enforcement Officer to require that non-conforming uses or any existing uses shall maintain valid certificates of occupancy identifying them as non-conforming or permitted uses as applicable. No fees will be charged for the issuance of certificates of occupancy. 
5.32 	PROCEDURE 
A. 	Application: An application for a certificate of occupancy must be made for all dwellings and buildings to be occupied. (Building permits should have been previously approved.)  These regulations apply to mobile homes as well as other dwellings and occupied structures including commercial and industrial.  Public utilities (water, sewer, electricity) shall not be used by the occupant until the certificate is issued. This provision shall not prohibit the use of necessary public utilities before and during construction. The Building Inspector shall find that sewage treatment is installed in an adequate and safe manner. The Building inspector shall see that the construction is in accordance with the building permit, Health Department regulations, zoning ordinance regulations such as setback, road frontage, lot width, and if necessary, road dedication and road construction.  Mobile homes have the same yard requirements as single family houses of conventional construction. 
B. 	Permanent File: The Enforcement Officer shall keep a permanent file of all applications and all certificates issued. 
C. 	Issuance: If the newly erected or altered structure and the new use of premises conform with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, and all other applicable ordinance regulations, and codes, the Enforcement Officer shall issue a certificate of occupancy authorizing the use thereof. If the structure or use fails to conform, the Enforcement Officer shall refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy and shall deliver written notice to the applicant stating the reasons for the refusal.  The Enforcement Officer shall inspect a new structure on the premises for which a new use is proposed and shall issue or refuse a certificate of occupancy within five working days after the date on which the new use is ready to commence. 
D. 	Validity:  The issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Enforcement Officer shall not waive any provision of the Zoning Ordinance. 

5.4 	BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 


5.41 	APPOINTMENT AND ORGANIZATION 
A Board of Adjustment (hereinafter known as the Board) shall be appointed, organized and conducted in conformance with the Kentucky Revised Statutes, Section 100.217. Any incorporated area has the right to appoint its own Board of Adjustment. 
5.42 	POWERS AND DUTIES 
The Board shall have the following powers and duties: 
A. 	Bylaws:  That Board shall adopt bylaws for its own government. 
B. 	Administrative Review: The Board shall hear and decide upon appeals from decisions of the Enforcement Officer.  The Board shall decide on questions involving literal interpretations of the Zoning Ordinance, shall interpret the exact location of district boundaries according to Section 3.2, shall interpret the amount of off-street parking, loading and unloading areas required according to Section 2.71 through 2.73 and shall make only those other interpretations and decisions specifically delegated to it by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the Kentucky Revised Statutes. 
C. 	Conditions Use: The Board shall have the authority to approve or disapprove applications for conditional uses in conformance with Section 
2.33 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
D. 	Variances: The Board may vary the strict application of the dimension and area regulations provided that unique conditions prevent strict conformance and would thus deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his premises. Financial disadvantage to the property owner shall not constitute conclusive proof of unnecessary hardship within the purpose of zoning.  The Board shall not grant a variance unless all of the following general conditions are met: 
1. 	
The specific conditions in detail which are unique to the applicant's land and do not exist on other land in the same zone. 

2. 	
The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. 

3. 	
That the unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the Zoning regulations. 

4. 	
Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm the public safety and welfare, and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 


E. 	Special Variances: The Board may grant a variance when the following special condition is present in lieu of the four general conditions listed above: 
1. 	If an undeveloped lot of record existing before July 31, 1958, is too small to allow conformance with the dimension and area regulations and if the owner has owned no adjoining land since July 31, 1958, the Board may grant a variance to allow the owner the reasonable use of his premises. When adjoining undersized lots of record are under the same ownership, they shall not be used or sold separately except in conformance with the dimension and area regulations of the Zoning Ordinance. 
4 

5.43 	PROCEDURE 
An application to the Board for an original interpretation or decision or an appeal from a decision of the Enforcement Officer shall be made in writing. An appeal must be filed within sixty days after the Enforcement Officer has refused a building permit or certificate of occupancy, or the right to appeal shall be waived. The Enforcement Officer shall transmit to the Board the complete record of the decision appealed. The Board shall hold a hearing at which all pertinent evidence concerned with the interpretation, decision, or appeal shall be examined, and the Board shall make their decision within two weeks after the hearing. The following rules shall govern all decisions made by the Board: 
A. 	Limits of Authority:  The Board shall act only within the strict limits of its authority as defined in the Zoning Ordinance. The Board has no authority to vary the use regulations or other regulations not specifically delegated. The Board shall not hold hearings on applications or appeals seeking decisions that the Board is not authorized to make. 
B. 	Special Conditions: The Board may attach special conditions to any decision it is authorized to make to ensure that the intent of the Zoning Ordinance will be carried out. 
C. 	Majority Vote Required: The concurring vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Board shall be necessary in making any decision. The Chairman shall have the right to vote on any subject or matter before the Board. 
D. 	Additional Powers:  In exercising the above powers, the Board shall have all the powers of the Enforcement Officer in addition to its other powers and duties. 
5.5 	CLARIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATION JURISDICTION 
The following is a recapitulation of the agencies with jurisdiction and the extent of their jurisdictions concerning the administration of the Zoning Ordinance. 
A. 	The Enforcement Officer has initial authority for the literal enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance. He has no discretionary authority to allow any departure from the literal conformance with the Zoning Ordinance. 
B. 	The Board of Adjustment has authority to hear appeals from decisions by the Enforcement Officer and to make literal interpretations of the pertinent provisions to correct any possible misinterpretation by the Enforcement Officer.  The Board also has the authority to make only those initial discretionary interpretations and decisions and allow those departures from literal conformance which are specifically delegated to it. The Board has authority to allow conditional uses. 
C. 	The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to determine all questions and issues properly brought before it on appeal from decisions of the Board of Adjustment or the Planning Commission according to the Kentucky Revised Statutes, Section 100.437. 
D. 	The Planning Commission, in addition to its other primary responsibilities concerning adopting and amendment of the Zoning Ordinance and subdivision plat review and approval, has the authority and responsibility for approval or disapproval of planned development projects. This responsibility like subdivision plat review involves guiding the initial conversion of open or agricultural land to developed land, including the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing or planned streets, provision of adequate open space, and the avoidance of congestion, etc. and is consequently equivalent to the Planning Commission's primary responsibility for subdivision plat review and approval. 

5.6 	VIOLATIONS 


5.61 	REMEDIES 
In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this Ordinance, the Building Inspector shall order that such violation cease. In cases of possible violation where the Building Inspector cannot determine if there is literal violation, he shall apply to the Board of Adjustment for an interpretation. If necessary, the City or County Attorney or any other appropriate authority or any property owner or occupant who would be damaged by a violation may institute appropriate action in court to eliminate the threat or existence of any violation of the Zoning Ordinance in accordance with the Kentucky Revised Statutes. 

5.62 	PENALTIES 
Fines and other penalties may be imposed upon violators according to the provisions of Kentucky Revised Statutes, Section 100.991. 
ARTICLE VI 
AMENDMENTS 
To make any amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, either to the text or to the map, the following procedure shall be followed.  If any use or density is not permitted in a zoning district by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, it may not be permitted by any agency unless the Zoning Ordinance is amended according to the amendment procedure. 
A. 	Review by the Planning Commission:  No amendment shall be made without first being reviewed by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may refuse to review proposed amendments which have been proposed and rejected within the past year. 
B. 	Public Hearing: The Planning Commission shall (call) hold a public hearing to consider a zoning amendment and may establish a separate schedule of reasonable fees to be paid by the applicant for the zoning amendment, (which fees shall cover the cost of adequate advertisement of the hearing by such means as the Planning Commission determines to be necessary.  Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper having general circulation throughout the city no less than seven and no more than 21 days before the scheduled hearing takes place) consistent with KRS Chapter 424. 
C. 	Recommendations to the Fiscal Court or City Council: The Planning Commission shall submit its recommendations to the City Council or Fiscal Court within sixty days after the public hearing. The Planning Commission may revise proposed amendments, in which case such amendments shall be presented again at a public hearing according to Kentucky Revised Statutes. The Planning Commission may also initiate proposed amendments. 
D. 	Action by the Fiscal Court or City Council:  Adoption of the Planning Commission's recommendations may be by a majority of a quorum of the members of the Fiscal Court or City Council. To overrule the Planning Commission's recommendations, a recorded vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Fiscal Court or City Council shall be necessary, after an evidentiary hearing. 
E. 	Currency of Zoning Map: The Planning Commission Chairman shall insure that amended zoning district boundaries are accurately placed on the certified copies of the Zoning Map and shall initial and date all such additions to the map. 
F. 	The Planning Commission may change the zoning of a particular parcel of land back to the original classification after a period of one year after the date of change in classification if any of the following findings are made: 
1. 	
That there has been no substantial progress in the development of the property in question. 

2. 	
That development plans adopted, or acted upon by the Commission in relation to the property in question cannot be carried out according to Commission findings. 

3. 	
That the Commission and/or governing body has adopted revised comprehensive plans or development plans wherein the proposed use of the property is other than the use permitted by the zone change, and that substantial progress has not been made toward the development of the property in the one year period. 

4. 	
That the findings necessary for map amendment in KRS 100.213 are applicable to the reversion.

GEORGETOWN/SCOTT COUNTY 
LANDSCAPE AND LAND USE BUFFERS ORDINANCE 
(City of Georgetown Ordinance Amended April 26, 1989) 

1.00 INTENT 

The intent of this article is to improve the appearance of vehicular use areas (VUAs) and property abutting public rights-of-way; to require buffering between incompatible land uses; to protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the community, and to promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise pollution, air pollution, visual pollution, air temperature, and artificial light glare. 
2.00 	SITES AFFECTED 
2.10 	New Development -No new site development, building, or structure shall hereafter be constructed or vehicular use area created or used unless landscaping is provided as required by the provisions of this Article, excluding agricultural and residential uses in agricultural zoning districts. 
2.20 	Change to Existing Development -No building, structure, or vehicular use area (VUA) shall be expanded, moved, or reconstructed and no use shall be changed to another use or increased in intensity unless the minimum landscaping required by the provision of this Article is provided for the property, excluding agricultural and residential uses in agricultural zoning districts.  Landscaping shall be provided only for any additional structures, parking or VUA over and above that of the existing development, except as follows.  If the additional parking or VUA requirement is equal to or greater than the number of parking spaces or VUA area provided by the previous use, then perimeter landscaping shall be provided for the entire vehicular use area serving the property. (See also Section 6.22 concerning interior landscaping requirements when VUA is altered or expanded.)  The provisions of this section shall be effective regardless of whether or not new construction is necessary to meet the parking requirements for the new uses. 
2.30 	Change of Zone -No use of an existing building, structure, or vehicular use area shall be commenced subsequent to a change in zoning unless property perimeter landscaping as required herein has been provided. 
3.00 AUTHORITY 
The authority to administer these landscape regulations is granted to the Planning Commission under KRS Chapter 100, Sections 201, 203, and 281. 
4.00 JURISDICTION 
The area for which these regulations apply shall coincide with the jurisdiction of the zoning ordinance of which they are made a part. 
5.00 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS 
Should the requirements set forth in this section be found in conflict with other provisions of these regulations, the more stringent regulations shall apply.  Any regulations adopted as part of a special landscape or urban design plan for particular areas (e.g., road corridor, downtown) shall supersede this ordinance. 
6.00 WHERE LANDSCAPE MATERIALS REQUIRED 
This section describes the minimum requirements that shall be met in regard to interior and perimeter landscaping for vehicular use areas, perimeter landscaping for incompatible land uses, and landscaping for service areas. 
6.10 Perimeter Landscaping Requirements 
Unless otherwise provided, landscape materials shall be installed to provide a minimum of fifty (50) percent winter opacity and a seventy (70) percent summer opacity, between one (1) foot above finished grade level to the top of the required planting, hedge, fence, wall, or earth mound within four (4) years after installation. The required landscaping shall be provided along the property perimeter in designated landscape buffer areas (LBAs) as shown in the chart Section 6.12 or adjacent to the vehicular use area as shown in the chart Section 
6.13.  A "Planting Manual and a Plant Materials List" shall be maintained by the Planning Office and available in the offices of the Building Inspection Office, to provide more detailed information on acceptable plant material.

*3 	To determine required area of landscape buffer area, multiply required width by length of common boundary.  Through the plan review process, landscape buffer area width may be averaged as follows, if the Planning Commission determines such averaging to meet the intent of this ordinance:  Using items 1C as an example, the 10' required width times an assumed 100' of common boundary equals 1,000 sq. ft. of required landscape area. Thus, if some sections of the landscape buffer area are only 5' in width, other sections will have to be greater than 10' in width in order to attain the required 1,000 sq. ft. of landscape area. Five (5) feet shall be the least dimension. 
*4 	A continuous planting of evergreen trees 15' o.c. shall be deemed to meet the requirements for trees and a continuous planting of shrubs provided the trees meet the requirements of Section 6.2433 and an opacity of seventy percent (70%) is achieved. 
*5 	No map amendment request, subdivision plat, or development plan shall be approved by the Planning Commission except in compliance with this section.  However, the Planning Commission shall not require such landscaping adjoining the Urban Service Area boundary where any of the following conditions exist:  major railroad lines, major water bodies (not including streams or farm ponds), public owned parks or open space, public property with a low intensity of use, or existing urban development along the Urban Service Area boundary. 
*6 	The 15' Landscape Buffer Area (LBA) may be reduced to 5' when used in conjunction with a 6' high opaque wall or fence, if the Planning Commission determines such reduction to meet the intent of this ordinance. 
*7 	In situations where a slope occurs along a boundary, the required landscaping shall be placed (in relation to the slope) where it will most effectively screen the more intensive use from the adjoining property. The maximum allowed slope in a buffer area shall be 3 to 1. 
*8 	Screening may be waived with the written concurrence of the adjoining property owner. 
*9 	For the purposes of determining buffer easements, established single-family uses and public uses such as parks and schools may be considered by the Planning Commission to be equivalent to single-family residential zones. 
*10 	When a wall is used to buffer any zone or VUA from a residential zone, it is to be constructed of precast concrete or constructed of/faced with natural stone or brick.

6.15 	Location of Landscape Buffer Area (LBA) 
The LBA described in 6.12.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, & 10 of section 6.12 shall apply to all common boundaries. The LBA described in 6.12.6 shall apply to the property line adjacent to the railroad right-of-way.  The LBA described in 6.13.1 shall apply to all common boundaries. The LBA described in 6.13.2, 3, & 4 shall apply to the property line adjacent to the freeway or public right-of-way. 

6.16 	Relationship to Yard Requirements 
Where there are requirements for LBAs and minimum yards, the more stringent requirement shall be complied with. 

6.17 	Responsibility for Providing LBAs 
The LBA set forth in sections 6.12 and 6.13 shall be provided as a condition of development by the person in charge of or in control of the property, whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, or otherwise, which creates the incompatible situation, or shall be placed on the activity or parcel being processed when the adjoining property is already developed with the exception of freeways and railroads.  An owner securing a change in zone which creates an incompatible situation shall be deemed the one who creates such situation and shall immediately provide the buffer area as a condition of the zone change.  If the incompatible situation already exists or is created by a general zone change not sponsored by the property owner, the buffer area shall be provided as a condition of the approval of any future subdivision or development plan of the affected land. 
6.171 	Inclusion of Subdivision Plat -Areas to be set aside for LBAs shall be shown on preliminary subdivision plats and development plans. Illustrations including trees, shrubs, ground covers, and barriers shall be shown on final subdivision plats and development plans. 
6.172 	Easement Conflicts -Where LBAs are required in the same location as utility easements, the two may be combined providing that the total width and screening requirements of sections 6.12 and 6.13 are met. However, where existing trees are to be preserved, the two may not be combined. Trees planted in easements containing overhead lines shall be small (S) trees that will not conflict with the utilities. 
6.173 	Provision of Planting Materials and Barriers -Such trees, shrubs, ground covers, and barriers as shall be required and/or shown on the final subdivision plat or development plan shall be provided by the owner or developer and considered as any other site improvement. (See Section 

6.32 concerning bonding of landscaping.) 
6.174 	Trees required as a part of the vehicular use area perimeter landscaping may be placed on the right-of-way adjoining such vehicular use area when approved by the Planning Commission and governing agency responsible for right-of-way maintenance with maintenance agreement. 
6.18 	Requirement Conflicts 
Whenever a parcel or activity falls under two or more of the landscape requirements listed in sections 6.12 and 6.13, the most stringent requirements will be enforced. 

6.19 	Landscaping at Driveway and Street Intersections 
To assure that landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard, a "sight triangle" will be observed at all street intersections or intersections of driveways with streets. At street intersections, the sight triangle shall be formed by measuring from the intersection of the curb lines at least 35' in each direction along the curb lines and connecting these points. At driveway intersections, the sight triangle shall be formed by measuring at least 15' back into the driveway and 20' in each direction along the curb line (forming two triangles). No landscape material shall be placed within the sight triangle that is greater than 18" in height. Trees having at least 5' of clear trunk (no limbs) or otherwise not presenting a traffic visibility hazard shall be permitted within the sight triangle. 


6.20 	Joint Driveways and Common Vehicular Use Areas 
Vehicular use area screening shall not be required between a vehicular use area and the adjoining property where a property line divides a driveway used for common access to two (2) or more properties nor when both of the following conditions exist:  a) the vehicular use areas are for the required parking for the properties or the common use of the properties (as substantiated by a reciprocal parking and access agreement), b) a final development plan for the properties has been approved by the Planning Commission. 

6.21 	Existing Landscape Material 
Existing landscape material which is proposed to be used to fulfill landscape requirements shall be shown on the required plan, and any material in satisfactory condition may be used to satisfy these requirements in whole or in part when, in the opinion of the Landscape Inspector such material meets the requirements and achieves the objectives of this article. Existing healthy trees from Group "A" or "B" of the Plant List may be substituted for trees required for property or vehicular use area perimeter landscaping, or for interior landscaping by using the following criteria:  a 6" to 12" caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 150 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for two (2) new trees of the required minimum size; a 12" to 24" caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 250 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for three (3) new trees of the required minimum size; a 24" or greater caliper tree surrounded by a minimum of 300 square feet of landscape area may be substituted for four (4) new trees of the required minimum size. 

6.22 	Interior Landscaping for Vehicular Use Areas 
Any open vehicular use area (excluding loading, unloading, and storage areas in an industrial zone) containing 6,000 or more sq. ft. of area, or twenty or more vehicular parking spaces, shall provide interior landscaping in addition to the previously required perimeter landscaping.  Interior landscaping shall be peninsular or island types. Where a vehicular use area is altered or expanded to increase the size to 6,000 or more square feet of area, or twenty or more vehicular parking spaces, interior landscaping for the entire vehicular use area shall be provided and not merely to the extent of its alteration or expansion. 
6.221 	Landscape Area -For each 100-sq. ft., or fraction thereof, of vehicular use area, ten (10) (amended by Georgetown City Council 9/16/99) sq. ft. of landscaped area shall be provided. 
6.2211 	Minimum Area -The minimum landscape area permitted shall be sixty-four (64) sq. ft. with a 4' minimum dimension to all trees from edge of pavement where vehicles overhang. 
6.2212 	Maximum Contiguous Area -In order to encourage the required landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no required landscape area shall be larger than 350 sq. ft. in vehicular use areas under 30,000 sq. ft. in size, and no required area shall be larger than 1,500 sq. ft. in vehicular use areas over 30,000 sq. ft. In both cases, the least dimension of any required area shall be 4' minimum dimension to all trees from edge of pavement where vehicles overhang. The maximum distance between landscape areas shall be 120' measured from the closest perimeter landscape area curb edge or the closest curb edge of each required interior area. Landscape areas larger than above are permitted as long as the additional area is in excess of the required minimum. 
6.2213 	Minimum Trees -A minimum of one (1) (05/08/2017 Ord. 17­004) trees shall be required for each 250-sq. ft. or fraction thereof of required landscape area. Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five (5) feet above the ground. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs or ground cover, not to exceed two (2) feet in height. 
6.2214 	Vehicle Overhang -Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet, as long as concrete or other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area. 
6.2215 	Minimum Canopy Requirements – The following table represents the minimum canopy coverage required at mature growth for each zoning classification:

6.23 	Landscaping for Service Structures 
All service structures shall be fully screened except when located in an industrial zone or when located more than 35' above the established grade (roof-top structures).  Service structures in an industrial zone shall be fully screened when located within 100' of any zone except industrial, or when within 100' of a public right-of-way or private access easement. For the purpose of this Article, service structures shall include propane tanks, dumpsters, air conditioning units and condensers, electrical transformers and other equipment or elements providing service to a building or a site. 
6.231 	Location of Screening -A continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall, or earth mound shall enclose any service structure on all sides unless such structure must be frequently moved, in which case screening on all but one (1) side is required. The average height of the screening material shall be one (1) foot more than the height of the enclosed structure, but shall not be required to exceed eight (8) feet in height. Whenever a service structure is located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping material, or vehicular use area landscaping material, such walls or screening material may fulfill the screening requirement for that side of the service structure if that wall or screening material is of an average height sufficient to meet the height requirement set out in this section. Whenever service structures are screened by plant material, such material may count toward the fulfillment of required interior or perimeter landscaping if location is appropriate. No interior landscaping shall be required within an area screened for service structures. 
6.232 	Protection of Screening Material -Whenever screening material is placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a fixed barrier to contain the placement of the container shall be provided within the screening material on those sides where there is such material.  The barrier shall be at least eighteen (18) inches from the material and shall be of sufficient strength to prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied. The minimum front opening of the screening material shall be twelve (12) feet to allow service vehicles access to the container. 
6.233 	Screening of Outdoor Storage Areas -All outdoor storage areas in industrial zones shall be screened by a solid wall or fence not less than six 
(6) feet in height. 

6.24 	Landscape Materials The landscaping materials shall consist of the following, and are described in more detail in the Planting Manual and Plant Materials List available at the Planning and Building Inspection Departments. 
6.241 	Walls and Fences -Walls shall be constructed of natural stone, brick or other weatherproof materials; while fences shall be constructed of wood or other weatherproof, durable materials generally used in the exterior construction of buildings (See also notes #10 and #5, for tables 6.12 and 6.13).  Fence posts shall be structurally stable based on the material used, and shall have a maximum spacing of 8' o.c. If wood is used, the posts shall be 4" x 4" minimum. Posts shall be set in or anchored to crowned concrete footers at least 6" larger in each direction than the post it supports.  The base of the footer shall be at least 24" below finished grade.  If wood is used for any member, it shall be softwood treated with water-borne preservative to the American Wood Preservers Institute standard LP-2 for above ground use or LP-22 for ground contact use, or all heart redwood, or all heart cedar. All cut surfaces of pressure treated lumber shall be water-proofed. If another material is used, it shall be weatherproof. Slats are to be minimum 1/2" in thickness and are to be placed on the outside of the fence unless the design is two-sided (shadow-box, etc.).  All hardware is to be galvanized or otherwise rustproofed. Wood horizontal members shall be installed bark-side up. Chain link fencing may not be used to meet the requirements of this Article. Chain link fencing may be installed in the required landscape area only if it is in addition to the required continuous planting, hedge, fence, wall or earth mound. In industrial zones, there shall be no height limitation on walls or fences; in all other zones, however, there shall be a six (6) foot height restriction for walls or fences in front yards and side street side yards, and an eight (8) foot height restriction in side and rear yards. All walls or fences shall have a minimum opacity of eighty (80) percent. Walls and fences allowed to meet the requirements of this Article shall not be used for the erection or display of any sign or other advertising device. 
6.242 	Earth Mounds -Earth mounds shall be physical barriers which block or screen the view similar to a hedge, fence, or wall,  Mounds shall be constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent erosion. A difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute an earth mound. Maximum slope shall be 3 in 1. 
6.243 	Plants -All plant materials shall be living plants (artificial plants are prohibited) and shall meet the following requirements: 
6.2431 	Quality -Plant materials used in conformance with provision of this Ordinance shall conform to the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspections required under State regulations. Bare root plants, with the exception of shrubs and hedges, vines and ground covers shall be prohibited. 
6.2432 	Deciduous Trees -(Trees which normally shed their leaves in the Fall) -Shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than fifteen (15) feet in Scott County and having trunk(s) which can be maintained with over five 
(5) feet of clear wood in areas which have visibility requirements. Trees having an average mature spread of crown less than fifteen (15) feet may be substituted by grouping of the same so as to create the equivalent of a fifteen (15) foot crown spread. A minimum of ten (10) feet overall height or a minimum caliper (trunk diameter, measured six (6) inches above ground for trees up to 4 inches caliper) of at least 1-3/4 inches immediately after planting shall be required. Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15) feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is completely contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior container dimensions shall be five feet square and five feet deep and for which the construction requirements shall be four (4) inches thick, reinforced concrete. 
6.2433 	Evergreen Trees -Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five (5) feet high with a minimum caliper of one and one-half (1-1/2) inches immediately after planting. 
6.2434 	Shrubs and Hedges -Shall be at least 12" with three (3) canes for Section 6.13 lines 3 and 5, at least 2' with three (3) canes for all other lines of Section 6.13 and 6.14, and 3' with four (4) canes for Section 6.12 in average height when installed. After approval by the Landscape Inspector and with the exception of the 12" plants, shrubs and hedges may be pruned to one-half the height in accordance with accepted horticultural practices. All plants shall conform to opacity, mature height, and other requirements of the final approval of each planting or replanting.  Privet, Ligustrum species, cannot meet the opacity requirements and may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this Article. The height of the planting shall be measured from the level of the surface of the vehicular use area at the edge closest to the screening. 
A-17 
6.2435 	Vines -Shall be at least 15 inches high at planting, and are generally used in conjunction with walls or fences. 
6.2436 	Grass or Ground Cover -Grass of the fescus (Gramineak) or Bluegrass (Poaceae) family shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in Scott County, and may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded; except in swales or other areas subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch shall be used, nurse-grass seed shall be sown for immediate protection until complete coverage otherwise is achieved.  Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover such as organic materials shall be planted not more than 15" on center and in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and have 75% of complete coverage after two complete growing seasons.  In certain cases, ground cover also may consist of rocks, pebbles, sand, and similar approved materials. 
6.25 Vehicle Overhang 
Parked vehicles shall not be permitted to overhang a landscape buffer area or an interior landscaping area more than two and one-half feet. Curbs or wheel stops shall be provided to permit no greater overhang. 
6.26 Maintenance and Installation 
All landscaping materials shall be installed in a sound, workmanship-like manner, and according to accepted, good construction and planting procedures. Any landscape material which fails to meet the minimum requirements of this Article at the time of installation shall be removed and replaced with acceptable materials.  The person in charge of or in control of the property whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant, or otherwise shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris, at all times.  All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first; while other defective landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within three months. Topping trees or the severe cutting of limbs to stubs larger than three (3) inches in diameter within the tree crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy shall not be considered proper or permitted for the maintenance of trees as required by this Article. Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Building Inspection Department to refuse a building occupancy permit, require replacement of landscape material or institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this Article. 
A-18 
6.30 Plan Submission and Approval 
Whenever any property is affected by these landscape requirements, the property owner or developer shall submit a landscape plan to the Planning Office.  For any property where a vehicular use area for twenty (20) or more vehicles or 6,000 or more square feet is provided, the landscape plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect, landscape architect or engineer licensed to practice in the State of Kentucky.  The requirements of this Article shall be followed in approving or disapproving any landscape plan required by this Article. 
6.31 Plan Content 
The contents of the plan shall include the following:  (a) plot plan, drawn to an easily readable scale, showing and labeling by name and dimensions, all existing and proposed property lines, easements, buildings, and other structures, vehicular use areas (including parking stalls, driveways, service areas, etc.) water outlets and landscape material (including botanical name and common name, installation size, on center planting dimensions where applicable, and quantities for all plants used); (b) existing and proposed contours at two (2) foot intervals; (c) typical elevations and/or cross sections as may be required; (d) title block with the pertinent names and addresses (property owner, person drawing plan), scale, date, north arrow (generally orient plan so that north is to top of plan); (e) zone of site and adjacent properties; (f) the location and dripline of any existing significant trees or tree stands, including those in fence rows and drainage areas, a general description of type and size of trees, and any proposed provisions for preserving trees, and (g) calculation of vehicle use area, required and provided interior landscape area. 
6.32 Building Permit and Certificate of Occupancy 
Where landscaping is required, no building permit shall be issued until the required landscaping plan has been submitted and approved, and no Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until the landscaping is completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the Landscape Inspector.  In instances where the State will issue the Certificate of Occupancy, the development plan shall not be certified until the required landscaping is bonded as outlined below.  If the required landscaping has not been completed and a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy is issued, a full cash bond, certified or cashier’s check, or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking institution with offices in the State of Kentucky shall be posted at that time and submitted to the Planning Director.  The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be based upon the cost of the proper installation of the uninstalled landscape material shown in the submitted plan with the cost certified by a landscape contractor.  The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall also include an inflation factor and/or administrative contingency cost of 25% of the base cost to complete the work in the event of the foreclosure of the bond or letter of credit. 
Where landscaping is required for a subdivision plat, certification or bonding is required prior to approval of Final Plat. 
6.33 Posting of a Full Cash Bond or Irrevocable Letter of Credit 
After a full cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit has been posted, the landscaping material required in the approved landscaping plan shall be installed within three (3) months after the date of posting the full cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit for Final Development Plans, or 12 months after the same date for Final Plats. Extensions of the planting period may be granted by the Landscape Inspector/Planner upon a demonstration by the property owner or developer that such an extension is warranted because of adverse weather conditions or unavailability of required plant materials.  No more than three (3) such one (1) month extensions may be granted. The full cash performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be called if the required landscaping has not been installed by the end of the approved planting period and the Planning Office shall apply the proceeds of the bond or letter of credit to have the work completed. 
6.4 Planting Manual and Plant Materials List 
Developers shall refer to the Planting Manual and Plant Materials List which are available at the Planning Office for minimal requirements to use in meeting the provisions of this Article. Any materials which are not on the Plant Materials List shall be considered on an individual basis to determine the suitability of the specific plant in the proposed location.  A plant not on the Plant Materials List shall be permitted only upon the expressed approval of the Landscape Inspector. 








7.00 ADMINISTRATION 
The enforcement of this ordinance shall be carried out as set forth on the following section. 
7.10 Enforcement The requirements of this ordinance will be administered by the Planning Commission and the Landscape committee of the Planning Commission with the assistance of a Consulting Landscape Examiner, and enforced by the appointed zoning enforcement officer.  It shall be unlawful to occupy any premises unless the required landscaping has been installed or bonded in accordance with the final subdivision plat or development plan. 
7.101 	Violations -In cases where the property owner or developer fails to install required landscaping, or where the property owner/tenant fails to properly maintain required landscaping, the officer of the Planning Commission shall notify the responsible party of such violation and order correction of same.  If necessary, the City or County Attorney or any other appropriate authority shall institute appropriate action in court to eliminate the violation. 
7.102 	Penalties -Fines and other penalties may be imposed upon violators according to section 5.62 of the Zoning Ordinance. After notification of the responsible party, each day of continued violation shall constitute a separate violation. 

7.20 	Variances 
In such individual situations where, by reason of exceptional topographic, dimensional, or shape or other special conditions of the site, the enforcement of these ordinances would create an undue hardship on the applicant, that applicant may appeal to the Planning Commission for relief from specific provisions. The Planning Commission may consider recommendations from the Landscape Committee, Mainstreet Board, or Architectural Review Board in deciding the appeal. 
LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE -PART TWO 

DEFINITIONS 

The following terms relate to the Landscape Ordinance and are generally not included in the list of definitions contained in most zoning ordinances. 
Landscape Buffer Area (LBA) -a strip of land to be set aside to separate incompatible land uses on which shall be placed trees, bushes, ground covers and barriers as necessary to reduce the deleterious effects of the activities. 
Landscaping -the use of planting material, pavements, walls, fences and earth mounds to enhance the aesthetic and safety characteristics of new and existing development. 
Earth mounds -ridges of piled earth constructed with proper slopes (not to exceed 3:1) and plant material to prevent erosion. 
Incompatible Land Uses -any facility or use on a property which is incompatible with the adjacent use.  For example, parking areas and dumpsters would be incompatible uses, but drainage facilities most likely would not. 
Interior landscaping areas -planting areas such as islands or peninsulas within a vehicular use area as required by Section 6.22 of this Ordinance. 
Vehicular use area -any open or unenclosed area containing more than 1,800 square feet of area and/or used by six or more of any type vehicle or mobile home including but not limited to parking lots, loading and unloading areas, sales and services area. 
Ground cover -planting with a mature height of twelve inches (12") or less including but not limited to grass, certain junipers, and ivy. Within LBAs next to a public right-of-way, crushed rock, tree bark or process shale may also be used. 
Low shrubs -low lying deciduous or evergreen ground covers. 
Shrubs -planting materials with a functional mature height of two to twelve feet with foliage for its full height. 
Trees -planting materials with a functional mature height of ten or more feet. When used in conjunction with interior landscaping areas, trees should have a minimum clear height of five feet from the ground to the lowest branch. 
Hedge -a row of bushes planted at such interval as to create a continuous mass within two years after planting. 
Fence -a barrier constructed of wood, metal, stone, brick or other weatherproof material for the purpose of restricting movement, or screening conflicting activities from sight. In the case of wood fences, slats are to be a minimum 1/2" in thickness and are to be placed on the outside of the fence unless the design is two-sided (shadow-box, etc.).  Chain link fencing may not be used to meet the requirements of this ordinance. The height of fences shall be governed as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.  Fences shall not be used for advertising purposes. 
LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE -PART THREE 
There is hereby established a Landscape Review Committee for the purpose of insuring compliance with the provisions of portions of the Zoning Ordinance as they relate to landscaping. The Committee, with the approval of the Planning Commission, shall engage the services of a Landscape Examiner to review development plans and final plats for compliance with this Ordinance. The Landscape Examiner shall have the power and authority to require such modification of any plat or plan submitted as to insure compliance with the Ordinance. The Committee shall review requested variances of this Ordinance and make recommendations on these variances to the Planning Commission.  The Committee or Landscape Inspector shall also inspect the premises prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.  If, due to seasonal variance, planting is not practical at the time required for the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, the inspection will be at such time as the planting and landscaping is actually completed. If, in the opinion of the Committee or Landscape Inspector, the Ordinance has not been complied with, it may make such recommendations to the enforcement officer and request that appropriate legal action be instituted. The Landscape Inspector shall assist the Committee in notifying property owners/tenants of violations to this Ordinance and seeking resolution of same. 
The Committee should consist of the following persons: a registered landscape architect, or horticulture specialist, one member appointed from the general public, and the enforcement officer or designee.

ARTICLE 1. 	STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
SECTION A. 	STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION 
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 67.083, 83A.130, and 83A.140 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. KRS 151.230 empowers local government to enact administrative regulations for floodplain 
management through Ordinance. Local Government’s participation in the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP) assures the Federal Insurance Administration that it will enact as necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having flood, or flood-related erosion hazards, adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with the Criteria set forth in Parts 59, 60, and 65 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations (44 CFR).  Therefore, the Fiscal Court of Scott County, the City Councils of Georgetown and Stamping Ground, and the City Commission of Sadieville, Kentucky, hereby adopt the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows: 
SECTION B. 	FINDINGS OF FACT 
1) 	The flood hazard areas of Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2) 	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. 
SECTION C. 	STATEMENT OF PURPOSE 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to: 
1) 	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity; 
2) 	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
B-5 

3) 	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4) 	Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
5) 	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert 
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas. 

SECTION D. OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this ordinance are to: 
1) 	Protect human life and health; 
2) 	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3) 	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4) 	Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5) 	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6) 	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; 
7) 	Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area; and 
8) 	Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume responsibility for their actions. 
ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application. Definitions contained in the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision and Development Regulations of Scott County may conflict and are intended for use in those provisions and shall not be used to interpret this ordinance. 
B-6 

A Zone – Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined. 
Accessory structure (Appurtenant structure) – A structure located on the same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure.  Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential.  Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
Accessory use – A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
Addition (to an existing structure) – Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall.  Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
A1-30 and AE zones – Special Flood Hazard Areas inundated by the 1% annual chance flood (100-year flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined. 
AH zone – An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between 1 and 3 feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown. 
AO zone – An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) Flood depths are shown. 
Appeal – A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any 
provision of this ordinance or from the Floodplain Administrator's ruling on a request for a variance. 
AR/A1 – A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones – Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
A99 zone – That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction. No base flood elevations are determined. 
Area of shallow flooding – A designated AO or AH (VO) Zone on a community’s Flood 
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three feet, there is 
B-7 

no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
B and X zones (shaded) – Areas of the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood, areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile, and areas protected by levees from the base flood. 
Base flood – A flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood").  Base flood is the term used throughout this ordinance. 
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) – The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Basement – That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides. 
Building – A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground; including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facility or infrastructure. See definition for structure. 
C and X (unshaded) zones – Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain. 
Community – A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
Community Rating System (CRS) – A program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the Regular Program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures for protection from flooding. Community Flood Hazard Area (CFHA) – An area that has been determined by the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams. 
Critical facility – Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the health and safety of the public.  Critical facilities include, but are not limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after a flood, and 
B-8 

those facilities or installations which produce, use or store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials, hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
D zone – An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.

Elevated structure – A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, piling, columns (post and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls.  (See freeboard requirements for residential and non­residential structures.) 
Elevation Certificate – A statement certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of certification that verifies a structure’s elevation and other related information to verify compliance with this ordinance. 
Emergency Program – The initial phase under which a community participates in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
Enclosure – That portion of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the structure. 
Encroachment – The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
Existing construction – Any structure for which the “start of construction” commenced before 
the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. 
“Existing construction” may also be referred to as “Existing structures”. 
Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision – A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special flood hazards. 
Expansion to an existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision – The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
B-9 

Five-Hundred Year Flood – The flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year.  Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to low risk of flooding. 
Flood, Flooding, or Flood Water: 
1) A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land 
areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or 
runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows).  See 
Mudslides. 
2) The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.  See flood-related erosion. 
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) – A map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway. 
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) – A map on which the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). 
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) – A map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones. 
Flood Insurance Study – The report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and/or the Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area – Any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
Floodplain Administrator – The individual appointed by a NFIP participating community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances. 
Floodplain Management – The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and open space plans. 
Floodplain Management Regulations – This ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.  This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, 
B-10 

in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Flood-proofing – Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities, structures, and their contents. 
Flood-proofing Certificate – A certification by a registered professional engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces. 
Floodway – The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.  Also referred to as the “regulatory floodway.” 
Floodway fringe – That area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis. 
Floor – See Lowest Floor. 
Freeboard – A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors (future flood fringe development, uncertainties inherent with the methodologies, lack of data, debris that accompanies the base flood) that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.  Freeboard must be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as structure utilities, HVAC components including ductwork, etc. These components must be elevated or protected to the freeboard level and all portions of the structure below the freeboard level must be constructed using materials resistant to flood damage. A freeboard requirement means that new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures will be protected to a level higher than the base flood elevation. If the lowest floor of garages or accessory structures is below the freeboard level, the structure must meet the opening requirements of Article 5, Section B (3).  Two references on these requirements are Protecting Building Utilities from Flood Damage, FEMA-348, and Flood Resistant Materials Requirements, FIA-TB-2. 
Fraud and victimization – As related in Article 6, Appeals and Variance Procedures, of this ordinance, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Fiscal Court or City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years.  Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are 
B-11 

subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur.  In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
Functionally dependent use facility – A facility, structure, or other development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.  The term includes only a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
Governing body – The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
Hazard potential – The possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing capacity). 
Highest adjacent grade – The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic Structure – Any structure that is: 
1) 	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2) 	Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district. 
3) 	Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4) 	Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a) By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or b) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) – Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares 
B-12 

the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building. 
ICC coverage is available on residential and non-residential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP. 
Kentucky Revised Statute 151.250 – Plans for dams, levees, etc. to be approved and permit issued by cabinet – (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet) 
(1) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city, county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts, drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except those constructed by the Department of Highways) across or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit issued.  However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply. 

(2) 
No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in subsection (1) above. 

(3) 
Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS Chapter 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151 concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface coal mining operations. 


Letter of Map Change (LOMC) – Is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s include the following categories: 
1) 	Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) – A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
B-13 

2) 	Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) -A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
3) 	Letter of Map Revision – Fill (LOMR_F) – A determination that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA. 
Levee – A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee System – A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met: 
1) 	All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). 
2) 	All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
Limited storage – An area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
Lowest adjacent grade – The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction.  It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a 
structure’s foundation system. 
Lowest Floor – The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a structure’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance. 
Manufactured Home – A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or 
longer and intended to be improved property.  The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle” (see Recreational Vehicle). 
B-14 

Manufactured home park or subdivision – A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Map – The Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Map Panel Number – The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.) 
Market value – The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (Actual Cash Value) or adjusted assessed values. 
Mean Sea Level (MSL) – The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide.  For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used as a reference for 
establishing various elevations within the floodplain as shown on a community’s FIRM.  For 
purposes of this ordinance, the term is synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. 
Mitigation – Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery. 
Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) – Describes a condition where there is a river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.  A mudslide (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the Floodplain Administrator only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs. 
Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) area management – The operation of and overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e. mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) prone area -An area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – The federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
B-15 

National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) – As corrected in 1929, a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. (Generally used as the 
vertical datum on the older FIRM’s. Refer to FIRM legend panel for correct datum.) 
New Construction – Structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of Scott County or the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, or Stamping Ground’s floodplain management regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision – A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of Scott County or the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, or Stamping Ground’s adopted floodplain management ordinances.

SECTION B. ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT 
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in Article 3, Section B. Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following:  plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, 
B-23 

dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.  Endorsement of local administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be processed. Specifically, the following information is required. 
1) 	Application Stage 
a) 	Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or 
b) 	Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed; and 
c) 	All appropriate certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria in Article 5, Section B (2) and Section D (2); and 
d) 	Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
2) 	Construction Stage 
Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator and to the State a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to Mean Sea Level.  In AE, A1-30, AH, and A zones where the Community has adopted a regulatory Base Flood Elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. 
When flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued work undertaken prior to the submission of the certification 
shall be at the permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the 
lowest floor and flood proofing elevation survey data submitted.  Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed.  Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
SECTION C. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR 
The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The Floodplain 
B-24 

Administrator is further authorized to render interpretations of this ordinance, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose by granting or denying Floodplain Development Permits in accordance with its provisions. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1) 	Permit Review:  Review all development permits to ensure that:

ARTICLE 5. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
The Environmental Quality Element of the Comprehensive Plan for Scott County establishes goals and objectives intended to protect environmentally sensitive areas, including Special Flood Hazard Areas. As a result, the Zoning Ordinance of Scott County defines a Conservation District in Section 4.2 and the Subdivision and Development Regulations of Scott County set policies for environmentally sensitive areas in Article XII, Section 1200. These provisions limit development in Special Flood Hazard Areas, defined in Article 3 of this ordinance. With the desire to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground prohibit new construction and substantial improvements within the Special Flood Hazard Area. As a result, the lowest adjacent grade of a structure is typically above the base flood elevation and flood-proofing of structures near Special Flood Hazard Areas is not required. Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground recognize Non-Conforming Structures (See Zoning Ordinance Section 2.1 and 2.41) do exist. The following provisions in Article 5 are established in the event new construction and substantial improvements are permitted by Variance (see Article 6 of this ordinance) within the Special Flood Hazard Area.  Applicable portions of these provisions shall also be used when permitting development on parcels of land contiguous to Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
B-28 

SECTION A. GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS 
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas the following provisions are required: 
1) 	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
2) 	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the­top or frame ties to ground anchors.  This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
3) 	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
4) 	New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
5) 	Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and, if within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
6) 	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
7) 	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
8) 	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
9) 	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is not in 
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall meet the requirements of “new 
construction” as contained in this ordinance. 
10)Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if said non­conformity is not furthered, extended, or replaced. 
SECTION B. SPECIFIC STANDARDS 
B-29 

In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Article 3, Section B, or Article IV, Section C (11), the following provisions are required: 
1) 	Residential Construction.  New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.  Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 5, Section B (3). 
a) 	In an AO zone, See Article 5, Section D.1.a. 
b) 	In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, lowest floor elevated two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community.  The Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined.  Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries(and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, Division of Water.  If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, Division of Water may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations. 
c) 	In all other Zones, elevated two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.

5) 	Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways.  Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
B-33 

Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; 
• 	If Article 5, Section B (5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5. 
6) 	Standards for Utilities. 
a) 	All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
(i)  	
Infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and 

(ii) 
Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 


b) 	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
7) 	Structures Elevated on Fill. A residential or non-residential structure may be constructed on permanent fill in accordance with the following:

b) 	The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compacting and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the base flood elevation, said slope being no greater than a 2:1 ratio unless a stability analysis is provided by a registered professional engineer; 
c) 	The top of the fill shall be no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.  However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the structure from damage due to erosion, scour, and other hydrodynamic forces; 
d) 	The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties; 
e) 	All new structures built on fill must be constructed on properly designed and compacted fill (ASTM D-698 or equivalent) that extends beyond the building walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and has appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill or the fill standard must be approved by a licensed professional engineer; or 
B-34 

f) 	If the community adopts and enforces the soil testing and compaction requirements set forth by the Standard, Uniform, or National Building Codes or the International Residential and Building Codes, it may qualify for additional CRS credit. 
8) 	Vegetative Buffer Strips (Riparian Zones). For all activities involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
a) A natural vegetative buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the mean high water level of the channel. 
b) Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
c) The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip.  Access through this buffer strip shall be provided for stream maintenance purposes. 
SECTION C. 	STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (UNNUMBERED A ZONES) AND/OR FLOODWAYS 
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Article 3, Section B, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply: 
1) 	No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.  The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
2) 	New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with Article 3, Section B. 
SECTION D. STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES 
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1’ – 3’), where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
B-35 

1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall: 
a) 	Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in an AO zone, lowest floor elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least two (2) feet, or elevated at least three 
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
2) 	All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
a) 	Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade.  In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
b) 	Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood proofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of two (2) feet so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in Article 5, Section B (2). 
SECTION E. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS 
1) 	All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
2) 	All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
3) 	All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and, 
4) 	In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided. 
B-36 

5) 	All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
6) 	All new subdivision proposals shall include streets for emergency access that are elevated at or above flood waters during the one percent (1%) annual chance flood (100-year flood). 
SECTION F. STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES 
BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER ‘A’

2) 	Must be anchored to resist floatation forces. 
3) 	Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at least two openings required on opposite walls. 
4) 	Built of flood resistant materials below a level two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. 
5) 	Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation. 
6) 	Can only be used for storage or parking. 
7) 	Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting. 
SECTION G. CRITICAL FACILITIES 
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).  Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within or adjacent to the SFHA shall be constructed on properly compacted fill and have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least two (2) feet above the elevation of the 500-year flood at the site. Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.  A critical facility shall have at least one access road connected to land outside the 500-year floodplain that is capable of supporting a 12,500 pound vehicle. The top of the road must be elevated to or above the level of the elevation of the 500­year floodplain.

ARTICLE 6. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES 
SECTION A. Nature of Variances 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.  The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.  The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the Fiscal Court and City Councils to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
SECTION B. Designation of Variance and Appeal Board 
The Boards of Adjustment for Scott County and the Cities of Georgetown, Sadieville and Stamping Ground are hereby established as Appeal Boards. The property location will determine the appropriate Board to hear the appeal. 
SECTION C. Duties of Variance and Appeals Board 
1) 	The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the 
requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or determinations made by 
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
2) 	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes. 
SECTION D. Appeals and Variance Procedures 
In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the: 
B-39 

1) 	Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2) 	Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3) 	Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4) 	Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility; 
3) 	Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent facility; 
4) 	Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
5) 	Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
6) 	Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
7) 	Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
8) 	Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
9) 	Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges. 
SECTION E. Conditions for Variances 
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
1) 	Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
2) 	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Board of Adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to 
B-40 

build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Board of Adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this ordinance. 
3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the 
“minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the instance of 
an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure. 
4) 	Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a) 	A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b) 	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this ordinance); and 
c) 	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
5) 	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
6) 	The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request. 
7) 	Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 6.3 A through 6.3 E are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
SECTION F. Variance NOTIFICATION  
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
B-41 

1) 	The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and; 
2) 	Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Clerk of Scott County and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
3) 	The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
SECTION G. HISTORIC STRUCTURES 
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
SECTION H. NO IMPACT CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE FLOODWAY 
Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
ARTICLE 7. SEVERABILITY 
This ordinance and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable.  Should any section of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

3. 	
Removal of Temporary Signs located on Private Property 


C-4 

a. 	Before bringing an action to require removal of any illegal sign, the Chief Building Official shall give written notice to the owner of the sign and the owner of the premises on which such sign is located. If the Chief Building Official has the 
owner’s telephone number, he may also call the sign’s owner at the time of the 
written notice. The notice shall describe the violation and the reasons for removal of the sign. 
b. 	
Notice period 

i. 	The notice period for temporary signs shall be forty-eight (48) hours. 
ii. 	Re-erection of any sign or substantially similar sign on the same premises after a compliance notice has been issued shall be deemed a continuation of the original violation if compliance with this ordinance has not been demonstrated. 

c. 	
If the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign located has not demonstrated compliance with this ordinance, then the GSCBI shall certify the violations and refer the case to the County Attorney for prosecution. 

d. 	
Notwithstanding the above, the GSCBI may cause the immediate removal or repair (without notice to the owner of the sign, or of the property on which it is located) of any unsafe or defective sign or signs that create immediate hazard to persons or property. 

e.

ARTICLE I 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

100 TITLE, AUTHORITY, AND ADMINISTRATION 

These regulations shall be known, referred to, and cited as "The Subdivision and Development Regulations of Georgetown, Sadieville, Stamping Ground, and Scott County, Kentucky" and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these regulations". 
The following Subdivision and Development Regulations are hereby enacted and adopted by the Georgetown-Scott County Joint Planning Commission in accordance with KRS 100.273 - 100.292. The regulations include all Appendices. These regulations shall be administered by the Georgetown-Scott County Joint Planning Commission (hereinafter, "The Commission") and the staff of the Commission. 
105 	PURPOSE AND POLICY 
These regulations are adopted in order to implement the Georgetown-Scott County Comprehensive Plan and to ensure the protection of public health, safety, and welfare. These regulations ensure that the Goals and Objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, insofar as they relate to subdivision and development, are substantially implemented. 
110 	JURISDICTION 
A. 	Pursuant to KRS 100.273, these regulations shall apply to all development within the boundaries of Scott County, Kentucky, including the incorporated areas of Sadieville, Stamping Ground, and Georgetown, and all the unincorporated portions of the County. 
B. 	It shall be unlawful for any person, being the owner, agent or person having control of any land in Georgetown, Sadieville, Stamping Ground, and/or the unincorporated areas of Scott County, to develop or subdivide such land before securing approval of the Commission of a plan or plat designating the areas to be developed or subdivided. Pursuant to KRS 
100.277 and other applicable statutes, no property shall be subdivided without Commission approval as required by these regulations.  No plat of a subdivision of land shall be recorded by the County Court Clerk until the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and the approval entered thereon in writing by the Chairman, secretary or other duly authorized officer of the Planning Commission; and no building permit shall be issued for any project requiring a development plan until the plan has been approved by the Planning Commission and the approval entered thereon in writing by the Chairman, secretary or other duly authorized 
officer of the Planning Commission. 
115 	APPLICANTS' DUTY TO ABIDE BY THESE REGULATIONS 
Protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires compliance with these regulations. Should the Commission overlook an item in its approval, or should such item not be shown on plans, the developer is not relieved of duty to fulfill the requirements of these regulations, absent a specific variance or waiver as permitted herein. 
120 	ENFORCEMENT 
A. 	All violations of these regulations, including the sale or offer to sell any lot, tract, or property which does not conform to the requirements of these Regulations shall be subject to the appropriate sanctions provided under KRS 100.991. The Planning Commission may apply for an injunction against any type of development or subdivision by the subdivider, developer, or the landowner where these Subdivision and Development Regulations have been violated. 
B. 	The Planning Commission may take action in accordance with KRS 
100.991 to fine any person or entity who is in violation of these provisions or any of the regulations adopted pursuant hereunder for which no other penalty is provided. 
C. 	If the Commission Engineer finds that work performed as required by these regulations fails to conform to the approved plan and specifications, he may, by written order, direct conformance, direct suspension of other work until conformance has been achieved, or direct such other measures that will achieve conformance with the intent of these regulations.  The Planning Commission may, on recommendation of the Commission Engineer, enforce the provisions of any bonds or letters of credit submitted to secure installation of required improvements. 
125 	INCONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PROVISIONS 
Wherever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards set forth in these regulations and those of any other lawfully adopted rule, regulation, ordinance or resolution, the most restrictive or highest standard shall apply. 
Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the subdivider/developer from placing self-imposed restrictions, or imposing higher standards than required by these regulations, but not in violation of these regulations, on the development.  Such deed restrictions or covenants shall be indicated on or attached to the plat or plan for processing by the Commission and filing with the County Clerk.\ 
130 	AMENDMENTS 
Any requirements or provisions of these Regulations may be changed and amended from time to time upon action of the Planning Commission in accordance with applicable State Statutes. 
135 	VARIANCES FROM SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 
The Planning Commission may grant variances from strict application of these Subdivision and Development Regulations, as a part of preliminary subdivision plat review or preliminary development plan review, according to the following: 
A. 	Variances may be granted according to the same purposes, analysis, and findings required of the Board of Adjustment for zoning variances, as set forth in KRS 100.243; 
B. 	Variances may be granted for the purpose of encouraging flexibility and economy in site design and/or providing for open space or protection of environmentally sensitive areas, if the intent and purpose of these regulations and the goals, objectives, and policies of the Comprehensive Plan are substantially met; or 
C. 	Variances may be granted to accommodate physical conditions exceptional and unique to the property sought to be subdivided or developed, if the intent and purpose of these regulations and the Goals, Objectives, and Policies of the Comprehensive Plan are substantially met. 
140 	SEPARABILITY 
If any article, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of these Regulations is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional or void, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of these Regulations. 
145 	FEES 
Each filing or submission to the Planning Commission for Review under these Regulations shall be accompanied by a filing fee, the schedule for which is available at the Planning Commission office. 
150 	DEADLINES 
Filing and submittal deadlines must be observed by applicants for approvals to proceed as indicated in these Regulations. The Planning Commission must make determinations on Preliminary Plats or Plans within ninety days of the first day of the month following submittal, unless waived in writing by the applicant, 
and must make determinations on Final Plats or Plans that do not require reconsideration by the Planning Commission within thirty days of submittal. 
155 	POST-APPROVAL AMENDMENT OF FINAL PLATS OR PLANS 
All projects shall be constructed according to the approved construction plans for plats or final development plan and all notes and conditions of the plat or plan unless an amended plat or development plan is approved.  Amended plats or plans shall be filed according to the procedure for filing Final Plats or Plans and planning staff shall determine whether the amendment is major or minor.  Major amendments are those that substantially change the plat or plan as approved by the Commission, such as an increase in number of units or square footage, change in building footprint or parking configuration, or change in streets, open space, or other public facilities. Major amendments shall follow the same process as preliminary plats or plans. Minor amendments shall follow the same process as for minor plats and plans. 
160 	APPEALS 
Any action by the Planning Commission staff, including but not limited to staff comments and recommendations, determinations of status as a major or minor plat or plan, approvals of site improvements, and orders pursuant to paragraph 140(c), may be appealed according to the appeals process in Appendix II. 
165 	SUFFICIENCY OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Planning Commission may deny approval of any proposed development for which infrastructure sufficient to serve the needs generated by the proposed development is neither available nor planned to be constructed as part of the proposal or as part of the capital improvement program of the providing agency.  
170 	ANNEXATION AND URBAN SERVICE BOUNDARIES 
A. 	All new urban development located within Urban Service Boundaries as shown in the Comprehensive Plan shall be annexed to the appropriate city. Existing development that requires subdivision or development plan approval under these regulations shall also be approved only upon condition of annexation. 
B. 	Prior to final plat or development plan approval, the applicant for development of property not previously annexed shall submit a copy of the plat or plan containing the following Certificate of Annexation  signed by the Mayor of the appropriate city stating: 
I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS PROPERTY HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE CITY OF _________________________.

b. 	one (1) year after the date of final completion as acknowledged by the Planning Commission Engineer, subject to requests for renewal, for improvements not to be maintained by a public entity at that time. 
C. 	Extensions on security may be requested pursuant to Section 610.C. of this article. 
D. 	Security sufficiency requirements. 
Except where cash security is permitted as stated in Subsection D.3., below, the Planning Commission will only accept irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of the Planning Commission and/or the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court, in accordance with either Subsection A.1. or Subsection B.1., above, as applicable. Such standby letters of credit are subject to the current International Standby Practice 98.  Such standby letters of credit must be posted with terms and conditions satisfactory to the attorney for the Planning Commission before final plats are approved.  Further, in addition to and notwithstanding any provision of ISP 98 or any other applicable document or provision to the contrary, standby letters of credit must be written upon a bank or other appropriate financial institution that has office(s) located within 120 miles of Georgetown, Kentucky that are authorized and able to receive presentation of demands on such letters of credit. 
1. 	
The Planning Commission shall review the posted security each year for adequacy according to the current unit price estimate established and maintained by the engineering department. The Planning Commission may require an increase in the principal amount secured up to the percentage of increase in the consumer price index published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Hamilton County, Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana area or closest market area, if that index is discontinued. 

2. 	
It is the developer’s responsibility to notify the Planning Commission when public improvements are complete and to schedule final inspections. 

3. 	
In lieu of a standby letter of credit, the developer may post cash as security. For purposes of this provision, cash security includes certificates of deposit, Treasury certificates, certified checks and cashiers’ checks.  Said cash security shall be immediately deposited by the Planning Commission into an escrow account for the benefit of the Planning Commission and/or the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court, in accordance with either 

Subsection A.1. or Subsection B.1., above, as applicable. The developer shall submit with the cash security a letter specifically describing the improvements, warranties and/or maintenance to be secured.  The Planning Commission may use this cash security to pay for the timely and satisfactory completion of improvements or for the performance of maintenance or for other things covered by the cash security. The Planning Commission shall refund any unused portion of the cash security when the project is satisfactorily completed. 

4. 	
Any developer who posts security under these regulations shall sign a statement that he/she has read and understands this Article VI and all subsections thereunder and that he/she will abide by its terms. The developer must further acknowledge in writing that he/she is aware of the expiration date of the security and that he/she shall not attempt to hold either the Planning Commission or the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court, nor any employees of the same, liable for any damages that may result from strict enforcement of this Article VI and related regulations.   


605 	INSTALLATION OF PART OF IMPROVEMENTS IN PHASED DEVELOPMENTS 
The owner of a tract may prepare and secure approval of a preliminary plat for the entire tract and may install the required improvements in only a portion of such tract, but the improvements must be installed or provision made for their installation pursuant to the above paragraphs in any portion of the area for which a final plat is approved for recording; provided however, that any gas mains, storm sewers, trunk sewers, roads, and any sewage treatment plants shall be designed and built in such a manner that they can be expanded or extended to serve the entire area, and provided further that all other requirements of these regulations have been met. 
If the proposed development is a phased development, and heavy construction equipment must cross public roads constructed in earlier phases within the development, the developer shall post security equal to 5% of the total current cost of final surfacing and concrete work for the streets, which may be called by the Commission if necessary to repair any damage done to surface pavement, curbs, storm water inlets, or other concrete work.  This amount shall be retained until the project is completed or until construction traffic is limited to use of an alternative route. 
The requirements of this section are separate from and in addition to the maintenance and repair requirements set out in Section 620 of these regulations. 
610 	RELEASE, REDUCTION, EXTENSION, OR CALLING OF LETTER OF CREDIT 
[Existing of Section 610 is deleted. The following new sections A, B, C and D are created. The deleted text shall be provided.] 
The standby letter of credit shall provide all release, extension and call provisions and shall be in agreement with the procedures below. 
A. 	Release of Security 
Security shall be released by written certification of the Planning Commission Director  pursuant to the following procedures: 
1. 	
Security for unfinished improvements - proper installation of all improvements, with final subdivision plat and as-built plans furnished to the Planning Commission and inspection of work by Planning Commission’s engineer. 

2. 	
Warranty and maintenance security -

a. 	
one (1) year from the date of acceptance by the city or county of public improvements and with concurrence from the city council/city commission/fiscal court responsible for public maintenance; or 

b. 
one (1) year after the date of final completion, inspection and certification by the design engineer has been provided to the Planning Commission Engineer and the developer or current owners provide acknowledgement of future maintenance needs by the submission of a Maintenance Agreement executed by owners of all benefitted lots, if the completed improvements are serving four (4) or more single-family residential units and are not to be dedicated or are choosing to remain private. 




B. 	Reduction of Security 
Reductions in the amount of security may be made only under the following circumstances: 
1. 	Reductions must be requested in writing by the owner/developer, and must state: 
a. 	
the name of the subdivision or development project; 

b. 
the current amount of the security being held for unfinished improvements; 

c. 	
the amount of reduction being requested; 

d. 
an itemized list of the original unfinished items that documents what has been completed as of the date of the request and compares the original cost estimates with the their current estimated costs; 

e. 	
the projected schedule of completion of remaining improvements; and  

f. 	
the amount for the warranty and maintenance security if such security was required. 


2. 	
No more than two reductions shall be approved for the duration of the project. 

3. 	
Reductions shall be made following completion of specific required improvements, e.g., water lines, sewer lines, retention basins, etc. 

4. 	
Reductions shall only be made after written approval of the improvements is made by the Planning Commission’s Engineer. 

5. 	
Security for warranty and maintenance shall not be allowed to be reduced. 


 Security for unfinished improvements shall not be reduced below the calculated amount of the security for warranty and maintenance. 
C. 	Extensions of Time 
1. 
Procedure. The Planning Commission staff shall maintain a calendar of security expiration dates and carefully monitor the valid dates of the security and, if a portion of the security is still being held 60 days prior to its ending date, (either the amount of time granted in Section 600.A.3. or lesser date established by the security document) the Commission shall notify the developer and the applicable city or county’s designee that the developer  has 30 days to submit as-built plans and/or request a final inspection, or request an extension of time on the construction of the improvements and related security, stating specifically the factors delaying construction. If an extension is granted, the extended security must be received at least one (1) day prior to the expiration of the previous security. If extended security has not been received one day prior, the Planning Commission shall notify the bank of its intent to call the security, shall redeem the balance of the security and shall perform the work secured. 

2. 
Length. The Planning Commission, with approval from the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court or its designee, may grant an extension of up to, but not more than, one (1) calendar year from the security’s original date of expiration. The Planning Commission may grant a second and final extension 

pursuant to the same procedures, requirements and limitations for a first extension. Requests for extension shall be evaluated based on the best interests of the applicable city or county. 

3. 
No right to extension. Nothing about these provisions for extension requests shall obligate the Planning Commission to grant such requests nor shall they obligate the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court (or designee) to give its approval. If a request for extension is denied or if no extension is requested, the Planning Commission may call the security pursuant to Section 


610.D. 
D. Calling of Security 
The required security for unfinished improvements or warranty and maintenance security shall remain in effect until it is officially released as described above.  If the improvements are not satisfactorily completed within the time specified above or stated in the security documents, the Planning Commission may proceed against the developer and the projects security. If at any time the Planning Commission is required to notify the bank or financial institution of its intention to call the security, this shall be deemed as a violation of these regulations and the following shall apply; 
1. 	
The owner or developer of the subdivision or development shall be notified of the violation and means to remedy such violation and shall be subject to all applicable rules of enforcement contained in these regulations or associated regulatory bodies, and 

2. 	
The entire amount of the security shall be drawn regardless of the improvements completed up to the date of draw request.  Any funds not used after completion of all required work by the Planning Commission shall be returned to the bank or financial institution one (1) year after acceptance by public entity or final approval of all work, less five hundred dollars ($500) or such greater amount if documented as an amount necessary to be expended by the Planning Commission in procuring completion of all work, but not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) in any case. 

3. 	
A fee in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) shall be paid to the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission prior to acceptance of  replacement security if it is determined that a replacement security other than cash security may be accepted. The replacement security amount shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission Engineer and an increase in the amount may be required. This evaluation shall be determined according to the most recent engineering cost estimate, status of project completion and/or maintenance or repairs needed, and current unit price estimate (established and maintained by the engineering office). 


620 Maintenance and Repair of Improvements 
The developer shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair of the improvements installed for one year after final acceptance by the city or county, (with the exception of snow removal for streets proposed for acceptance by the City of Georgetown). The developer shall be responsible for any damage done to the improvements by construction traffic, local traffic, or by any other means, and shall insure the accessibility to all occupied lots during this time period. Upon completion of work and prior to public acceptance, the developer shall clean up all ground occupied or affected with his work. Failure to maintain or repair improvements may result in withholding approval of subsequent development, or the billing of the developer for such cleanup services performed by the city or county. The requirements of this section are separate from and in addition to the maintenance and repair requirements set out in Section 605 of these regulations. 
625 Liability Insurance 
The developer shall furnish proof of liability insurance as required and approved by the governing body which shall indemnify and save harmless the Planning Commission and the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court from any and all liability arising from any conditions related to the construction or installation of improvements by the developer.  The insurance shall not be allowed to expire earlier than one (1) calendar year from the date of final acceptance of the improvements for maintenance by the city or county.  A copy of the policy shall be filed with the City or County Clerk.

ARTICLE VIII 
 CONCEPTUAL PLANS 

800 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Conceptual plan approval by the Planning Commission may be required for zone changes if staff or the Commission finds there are existing or potential substantial flood, drainage, traffic, topographic or other similar problems relating to the development of the subject property that could have an adverse influence on existing or future development of the subject property or other property in the neighborhood. Conceptual Plans may be submitted for Planning Staff review of proposed subdivision or development of properties already zoned, for advice as to general workability of layout and stormwater management, classification as a Major or Minor Subdivision or Development, existence of environmentally sensitive resources, and guidance through the approval process, in addition to information as to the application of Planning Commission Regulations and the Comprehensive Plan to the project. 
805 	PROCEDURE FOR ZONE CHANGE CONCEPTUAL PLAN REVIEW 
A. 	Seventeen (17) copies of the plan shall be submitted to the Planning Office on or before the first working day of any month. The plan shall be accompanied by the filing fee. No Commission action shall be taken on any plan until required fees have been paid in full. 
B. 	Approval of the conceptual plan by the Planning Commission demonstrates that the site design proposal will be generally acceptable if all applicable regulations are satisfied, but is not approval of a final development plan or subdivision plat or approval to begin construction, nor does it guarantee the number of lots, units, or square footage. 
810 	CONTENT AND FORMAT OF ZONE CHANGE CONCEPTUAL PLANS 
For zone changes, the conceptual plan shall be on material capable of reproduction, and on uniform size sheets, 18" x 24" or 24" x 36", and the following information may be required: 
A. 	A vicinity map at a scale of two-thousand feet to the inch, indicating the boundaries of the proposed development and significant nearby public facilities, such as roads, schools, parks, shopping centers, and hospitals. 
B. 	On a U.S.G.S. or comparable topographic map of the area proposed for development, a simple plan showing: the proposed general layout of streets, entrances, rights-of-way, blocks, or interior use areas, utility easements, existing utility lines, and buffers; approximate proposed location and size of areas to be designated open space, conservation, and/or floodplain; direction of drainage and general drainage management plan, including the general location of retention and/or detention basins; location of proposed public facilities such as schools, parks, fire stations; and any other significant features.

(Section 1000, C amended 8/21/03 by the City of Georgetown Ordinance 2003-023; 9/25/03 by Scott County Ordinance 2003-09.) 
D. 	CURBS AND GUTTERS 
1. 	
CITY OF GEORGETOWN Curbing is required on all urban streets for the purposes of drainage, safety, and delineation and protection of pavement edge.   SCOTT COUNTY Curbing is required on all streets in urban-style developments (i.e., those developments with a density greater than one dwelling unit per acre and not zoned A-1 Agriculture.  Urban-style developments exclude rural cluster residential developments) for the purposes of drainage, safety, and delineation and protection of pavement edge. 

2. 	
Curbing shall be designed to provide ramps for wheelchairs at all street intersections with sidewalks with a minimum of one for every corner, and as required by state law. 

3. 	
Curbs and gutters are to be built to the following specifications: 


a) 	Construct all curb and gutter on a prepared subgrade to the dimensions and design as in the approved construction plans and/or standard drawings. 
b) 	All Concrete shall have class “A” specifications. 
c) 	Sawed contraction joints shall be constructed every 20 feet with a minimum depth of 3 inches in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Standard Specifications, Current Edition. 
d) 	Expansion joints shall be constructed at all breaks in alignment, at contact with new or existing concrete, at all drainage inlets, at the beginning and ending points of curves, and not to exceed 200’ maximum spacing for slip form 
application and 30’ maximum spacing for hand placed. 
e) 	Maintain concrete at a minimum temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 calendar days after placement and at a minimum temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit for an additional 4 calendar days. When the Planning Commission Engineer requires, submit a written outline of the method to be used for protecting concrete. The Planning Commission Engineer, and or Development Inspector reserve the right to discontinue concrete placement when the means of protection or method of placement does not produce satisfactory results. Do not place concrete during times of the year that the temperatures may be expected to drop below the 45 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit limits, unless there are adequate provisions at the job site for maintaining concrete at the specified temperature. 
f) Immediately after completing finishing operations and the concrete has set sufficiently to prevent marring the surface, cure the entire surface of the newly placed concrete, including the face of all construction joints. Cure according to one of the following methods: i) White Membrane Curing: (Type 2, Class “A” or “B”) Ensure that all curing compounds conform to AASHTO M 148. ii) Wet Burlap: Thoroughly wet the burlap before placing. Carefully place the burlap over the finished surface to completely cover the surface and sides of the slab. Clean the burlap of all coating of earth or other deleterious substances before using it. Soak new burlap in water for 12 hours before using. During the first six hours a single thickness of burlap will be required. After the first six hours, use a double thickness. Overlap adjacent burlap strips at least 3 inches. Keep the burlap thoroughly saturated and in place for at least 72 hours even when required strength is attained. iii) Curing Blankets: Keep the concrete continuously damp for the period of time specified for the item being constructed, beginning immediately after placing and finishing. As soon as possible, without damaging the concrete surface, moisten the concrete by applying water, and immediately cover the surface with the curing blankets. Place the blankets so that the adjoining blankets overlap at least 18 inches. Weight all laps and outside edges to prevent displacement of the blankets before completing curing. Ensure intimate contact between the blankets 
and the concrete surface. Use curing blankets that consist of a top layer of white copolymer material and a bottom layer of absorbent, non-woven, synthetic fabric. Ensure that the layers are securely bonded together so there will be no separation of the layers during handling and curing of the concrete. When tested according to AASHTO M 171, ensure that moisture loss does not exceed 0.010 grams per square centimeter and that reflectance is at least 70 percent. 
iv) 	Wet Curing: Cure concrete for a period of at least 7 calendar days, beginning immediately after placement and finishing, by frequently applying water to all surfaces to keep them continuously damp during the full 7-calendar day curing period or until the required strength is attained. Protect exposed concrete surfaces from drying by application of a double thickness of wet burlap or similar approved material and keep the burlap or other approved material continuously wet for a period of 7 or more days. Soak new burlap in water for at least 12 hours before the first use. 
g) 	Proposed curbing to be dedicated to the City of Georgetown shall be: i) box curb ii) shall be placed on a minimum of 6 inches of granular 
base material (DGA/CSB). 
(Section 1000, D, 3 adopted 8/21/03 by the City of Georgetown Ordinance 2003-023; 9/25/03 by Scott County Ordinance 2003-09.) 
E. 	SHOULDERS 
1. 	Shoulders and drainage swales may be permitted instead of curbs when: 
a) 	Shoulders are required by state law; 
b) 	Soil or topography makes the use of shoulders and/or drainage swales preferable; 
c) 	It is in the best interest of the community to preserve its rural character or natural drainage systems by using shoulders and/or drainage swales instead of curbs. 
Where shoulders and ditches are used, there shall be adequate cross drain measures at all driveways and intersections.

unless directed otherwise by the design engineer.  
v)  The cross slope of the proposed subgrade is to be ¼ inch  
per foot fall, except in cases of superelevated crowns.  
vi)  Finished subgrades must be proof rolled with a loaded 20  
ton vehicle, minimum. All lanes and cul-de-sac areas are to  
be rolled tested. Proof roll test is only applicable prior to any  
increase in moisture content due to weather conditions or  
other water-related circumstances, for example, rain, snow,  
waterline breaks, groundwater intrusion, etc.  
vii)  If pumping or rutting of the subgrade occurs, then the noted  
area is to be remediated by one of the following means:  
1) Synthetic: geotextiles.  
2) Mechanical: replacing unacceptable material with #2  
stone (open graded material is to be separated with  
KYTC Type II fabric from the subgrade and drained off).  
The minimum layer thickness shall be 8 inches of #2  
stone.  
3) Chemical: lime stabilization, etc.  
4) Reworking existing material: if material ruts during proof  
roll then this method is unacceptable; also after material  
is reworked it is subject to another proof roll test.  
viii)  At any given time, the Planning Commission Engineer can  
require verification that the remediation method meets the  
design parameters based on the subgrade conditions in the  
field.  

b) Base material i) Base material for all proposed roadways is to be either Dense Graded Aggregated or Crushed Stone Base (DGA/CSB), as defined by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). ii) CITY OF GEORGETOWN Each lift of DGA base material is not to exceed 6” maximum. After each subsequent lift string line will be pulled to check for proper depth and cross slope (1/4 inch per foot fall). Each lift will also require a check of the density and moisture content. The density shall be 84% of solid volume, or 140 lbs. per cubic foot. The acceptable moisture content range shall be from 3% to 5%.  SCOTT COUNTY Each lift of DGA base material is not to exceed 4” maximum. After each subsequent lift string line will be pulled to check for proper depth and cross slope (1/4 inch per foot fall). If a proposed roadway serves 60 units or greater and/or an urban-style development as previously defined, then each lift will also require a check of the density and moisture content. The density shall be 84% of solid volume, or 140 lbs. per cubic foot. The acceptable moisture content range shall be from 3% to 5%. iii) CITY OF GEORGETOWN ONLY Before constructing a CSB base, complete a control strip to determine the level of compaction necessary to achieve the target density for the remaining base course. Construct additional control strips whenever a change is made in the source, gradation, type of subgrade, type of base aggregate, or layer thickness. Leave each control strip in place to become part of the project. Complete at least one control strip for each layer of base material. Construct a control strip a minimum length of 500 feet and to the full width of the aggregate base course. Use the same equipment and procedures intended for the construction of the remainder of the base course. After two passes the Development Inspector will require (3) density measurements at randomly selected sites, at least two feet from the edge of the base.  The Development Inspector will require density measurements at the same (3) locations after subsequent passes of the compaction equipment. Compact the control strip until no further increase in density can be obtained from additional passes. The inspector will visually inspect the material after each pass to determine if the aggregate is being crushed into fine material. If the aggregate is being crushed, cracked, shoved, or shows other signs of distress, 
cease compaction efforts. If compaction of the base is not satisfactory, use other methods to achieve satisfactory results. After completing compaction of the control strip, the Development Inspector will require 10 field density measurements at random locations in the control strip and require the averaging of the 10 measurements to obtain the target density for the compaction of the base. Once the target density is obtained the remaining base course, equal to that same depth of the control strip, will be checked by nuclear gage at various locations. The density of these test sections shall average 98 percent of the target density or greater with no individual measurement less than 95 percent of the target density. When the average density of a test section does not meet the required density, cease laydown operations, and either provide additional compaction effort or rework the material to obtain the required average density. Do not add fines to meet the target density. 
iv) 	Density tests cannot be performed on any base layers that have standing water on them. 
v) 	During times of the year where base moisture is a concern, the designer can substitute the bottom 4 inch base layer with a 7 inch layer of #2 stone. This layer must be separated from the subgrade with KYTC Type II fabric and drained off (this layer cannot be applied toward any subgrade remediation). 
c) Asphalt layers i) All asphalt base and/or binder layers are to comply with KYTC Specifications. ii) Any proposed asphalt courses are to adhere to the following temperature limitations: 
Bituminous Mixtures  Minimum Ambient Air Temperature  
for Placing (Degrees Fahrenheit)  
Asphalt Mixture, Surface (one inch thick or  45  
less)  
Asphalt Mixture, Surface (thicker than one  40  
inch)  
Asphalt Mixture, Base and Binder  35  
Leveling and Wedging  45  

iii) 	Asphalt pavement sections are to have overlapping longitudinal joints of 6 inches. This can be achieved at either the base/binder or surface coat. 
iv) 	Proposed surface coats abutting existing surfaced roadways are to be milled and keyed into existing roadways, at least one foot. 
v) 	Asphalt base material may only be used with pavement specifications using a minimum base thickness of 4 inches. Excluding the use of surface material, asphalt layers less than 4 inches are to be KYTC Binder Class I materials.

The developer and/or his contractor shall build temporary access roads or designate specific routes to accommodate project traffic during construction. This shall be accomplished after approval of the preliminary plat and designated in the field with signage prior to the approval of the final plat and shall be subject to the provisions of Article XI. Any damage to existing paved roads due to subsequent construction activities shall be restored or repaired to the existing road standard prior to damage.  See Article VI (construction of improvements) for bonding requirements for phased development. If the temporary construction traffic route is a system of proposed roadways that can be dedicated to a municipality of and including Scott County, then these roads are to be designed to accommodate the construction traffic plus the anticipated 20 year roadway traffic. These streets are to have signs directing the construction traffic through the development. 
  CITY OF GEORGETOWN Any proposed roadway to be dedicated to the City of Georgetown for maintenance shall apply final inch of asphalt in the time period defined in Article VI.

Q. 	STREET ACCESS 
1. 	Residential: 
a. Permitted and required number of driveway entrances: 
i. 	A maximum of one per single-family lot, or two for corner lots, double frontage lots, or others, but only if demonstrably safe. 
ii. 	A maximum of two per duplex and fourplex. 
iii. 	Within urban services areas, incorporated areas, or rural PUDs, a maximum of five single family residential houses may share one sixteen foot paved driveway (maximum length - 150 feet) if parking is provided as required in Exhibit 10-3. 
iv. 	In rural or unincorporated areas, all lots shall have either frontage on an existing public street, private street or an approved access easement/driveway serving a maximum of three (3) lots. Such frontage or easement shall provide readily apparent physical means of access. The minimum separation distance between access easements/driveways shall be as regulated by subparagraph v. of this section. If this distance cannot be provided, the applicant must demonstrate a suitable separation distance to be approved by the Planning Director and/or Planning Commission Engineer; or request a variance in accordance with Article 1, Section 135 of these regulations. The provision for access easements/ driveways, or a series of driveways, is not intended to be used as part of an overall major subdivision design and should be discouraged. (amended by City of Georgetown Ordinance 1999-026, 7/15/1999) 
v. 	Every 2 adjacent five (5) to ten (10) acre lots in one subdivision in A-1 zoned areas shall have shared access, direct adjacent access, or access separation of at least 300 feet. 
b. 	Special street access requirements: 
i. 	High density (76 - 500 units) private driveways shall access only a street of 28 feet in width or greater, or a state road. (See also Exhibit 10-1 for total units allowed per type of street.) 
ii. 	No lot smaller than 5 acres shall access any arterial or principal arterial street. 
(amended by Scott County Ordinance 2000-02, 2/11/2000) 
c. 	Minimum distances between driveways: 
Distances between private driveway access and the nearest intersecting drive shall be measured from center line to center line. Distances to the nearest intersecting street shall be measured from the center line of the driveway to the right-of-way line of the street. 
i. 	Between high density driveways (76-500 units) and other streets or driveways --250 feet 
ii. 	Between medium density driveways (30-75 units) and other streets or driveways --100 feet 
iii. 	All other residential accesses shall not be less than 50' from the end of the radius of any collector intersection. 
2. 	Non-Residential - Non-residential uses, with the exception of neighborhood business uses, shall have access only to arterials or collectors. On non-residential streets, the first access point for private non-residential driveways shall not enter the street any closer than the beginning of the left turn taper of the nearest intersection. Accesses on opposing sides of the street shall be either opposite each other (+ 5.0 feet) or at least 100' from center line to center line. Accesses on the same side of the street shall be at least 100' from center line to center line.  All other accesses shall not be less than 50 feet from the end of the radius of any collector intersection. 
Where no other access is physically feasible to existing properties, the Commission may grant a variance in distance along with a requirement for combined entrances, right-in-only driveways, or other conditions where the KYTC and Commission Engineer approve the access point and design. If this option can not be satisfied safely then a service road leading from an approved entrance point to the non-residential site may be required, even if across intervening properties. 
R. 	ARTERIAL BUFFERING STANDARDS 
1. 	
Residential development along the bypass and I-75 shall be buffered by landscaping, earth mounds, or walls for visual purposes. Screening should substantially soften visual and noise impacts upon adjacent uses, especially residential. 

2. 	
Residential building setback requirements shall be no less than 100 feet from the bypass and I-75 rights of way.  This setback requirement shall also apply to ramps along the interchanges and major intersections. 


1005 OFF-STREET PARKING 
A. 	NUMBER OF SPACES 
1. 	
For residential developments, off-street parking shall be provided as set forth in Exhibit 10-3. 

2. 	
For non-residential developments, the minimum parking space requirements in Appendix VII shall be met. Where no specific uses are proposed, the parking standards in Exhibit 10-4 shall apply.   

3. 	
Loading and handicapped parking requirements for non-residential development are specified in Exhibit 10-5. 

4. 	
A one-car garage and driveway combination shall count as 2 off-street parking spaces, provided the driveway measures a minimum 

of 20 feet in length between the face of the garage door and the sidewalk, or 25 feet to the curbline, where there is no sidewalk.  A two-car garage and driveway combination shall count as 4 off-street parking spaces, provided the minimum width of the driveway is 16 feet and its minimum length is as specified above for a one-car garage. 

5. 	
For mixed-use developments and Central Business Districts, off-street parking may be shared where it is demonstrated that peak hour parking requirements will be met (i.e. residential uses associated with commercial or professional - different uses at different times). 

6. 	
The Planning Commission may allow parking requirements to be met on another property, where it is proximate to the development and an easement or other agreement secures the use of that property for parking during the life of the development. 

7. 	
Where the total number of off-street parking spaces required are not immediately required for a particular use, a staged development plan may be permitted requiring only a portion of the parking area at that time, so long as all grading, stormwater management, and water quality protection standards are met and Landscape and Buffer Ordinance requirements are met or secured for the entire portion of the site constructed or affected by construction. 

8. 	
Because of the concentrated nature of the Georgetown, Stamping Ground and Sadieville Central Business District, these standards shall not apply.

E. 	The maximum number of cluster lots is based on the acreage of the farm proposed for cluster development. All property associated with a cluster development should be under the ownership of the applicant(s) or under contract to the applicant(s), prior to preliminary approval of the cluster development by the Planning Commission. 
F. 	For cluster developments containing 100 lots or more, accel/decel lanes, turn lanes, and secondary access points will be required [Note: see also Item L-6]. 
G. 	Individual lot standards are as follows: 
1. 	
Lot size: 0.5 acre minimum, 2.0 acre maximum (outside the floodplain). Lot width: 150’ minimum at the building setback line (The lot cannot exceed a 2:1 depth-to-width ratio). 

2. 	
Front Yard Setback: 50’; however, for corner lots (or double frontage lots) the setback along an existing public road = 75’ (from edge of pavement). 

3. 	
Rear Yard Setback: 100’; however, for lots that abut any property other than other cluster residential lots, a minimum 50’ tree preservation easement must be established adjacent to the common property line, and within the required rear yard setback, where no existing vegetation could be removed/disturbed, unless demonstrated to be sick or dead. The preservation area shall also include required or additional landscaping/buffering as outlined in this Item. 

4. 	
Side Yard Setback: 25’ OR 100’ if side yard abuts any property other than another cluster lot; in such circumstance, the side yard shall be treated as a rear yard regarding building setbacks and landscape buffers. 


H. 	Environmentally Sensitive Areas may not be included within the cluster lot development, without a variance to increase the allowable lot size by the amount of acreage that is environmentally sensitive; otherwise, those areas must be part of the preserved acreage. 
I. 	All cluster proposals that include more than 30 lots (includes cluster lots and preserved lots) shall submit, for review and approval, a traffic impact study (TIS) per the attached guidelines and procedures. The TIS will be required prior to final plat review and approval of the 30th lot. If it is determined that the parent tract has been prematurely subdivided in order to avoid this requirement, the Planning Commission may require the TIS based on the configuration of the parent tract and any existing lots at the time these regulations were adopted. The required TIS may be waived upon recommendation of the Commission staff, where the road upon which the cluster is proposed is adequate for the anticipated traffic generated by the development. The adequacy of the road will be reviewed based on the carrying capacity of the existing roads based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 6th (or latest) Edition and the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 1990 (or latest) Edition. 
All cluster proposals will be subject to the road improvement policies established in the Comprehensive Plan – Transportation Element and subject to the carrying capacity of the existing roads based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 6th (or latest) Edition and the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 1990 (or latest) Edition. 
J. 	Cluster lots may share a common rear lot line with other cluster lots subject to all Health Department requirements. 
K. 	Required Landscaping/Buffering: Landscaping and buffering shall be required as follows [Note: existing screening/trees may be used towards these requirements subject to review and approval of the Planning Commission]: 
1. 	Where cluster lots abut any property other than other cluster residential lots (as described in Item I), a minimum 50’ tree preservation easement shall be established adjacent to the common property line, and within the required rear yard setback, where no existing vegetation could be removed/ disturbed, unless demonstrated to be sick or dead. The preservation area shall also include required or additional landscaping/buffering as determined by the following formula: there shall be a double row of evergreens/deciduous trees on 40’ centers and fencing. The ratio of evergreens and deciduous trees shall not exceed 
2:1. 
2. 	
Where cluster lots abut an existing road, trees shall be required on 30’ centers along the existing road frontage of the cluster lots. The ratio of evergreens and deciduous trees shall not exceed 2:1. 

3. 	
All proposed landscaping shall exclude any species of trees and shrubs that may be deemed harmful to livestock.

The notices and the sign must contain information regarding the nature of the proposal, date and time of the Planning Commission meeting, location of the Planning Commission meeting, and the Planning Commission’s address and phone number where additional information may be obtained. The notices and the sign must be mailed/installed at least 14 days prior to the Planning Commission’s meeting, but not more than 21 days. The day of the Planning Commission meeting should be excluded in calculating this number. 
R. 	All applicable standards of the Subdivision & Development Regulations will be required, including Erosion Control, Drainage Plans, and Construction Plans. 
S. 	The final plat of the cluster development and reserved property including all required restrictive covenant/deed restrictions, and homeowner’s association documents (if applicable), shall note and convey that the acreage reserved for agricultural/open space is restricted to its noted use. This covenant shall terminate at such time as the property is annexed into a city and approved by the appropriate legislative body of that city for a zone classification change (rezoning) to an urban use. 
T. 	A note is required on the final plat, “Prospective purchasers of residential lots are placed upon notice that hunting and fishing within accepted safety guidelines and agricultural use and production, including the use of machinery in the normal course of activity, are common and legal practices in the A-1 zone. It is understood that these uses must be expected to occur in and around A-1 developments. These practices, if conducted within accepted safety guidelines, shall not constitute a nuisance within the meaning of KRS 401.500 et.seq. Also see the Kentucky Right to Farm Act”. 
U. 	The developer must note on the preliminary and final subdivision plat(s) the types of dwellings (e.g. mobile homes, conventional frame construction, manufactured homes, etc.) which shall be permitted within this development. This requirement shall avoid potential buyer misunderstanding of the consequences of their investment. 
V. 	A note shall be placed on the final plat that the preserved area cannot be further subdivided. Property that is set aside as “preserved acreage,” by a recorded plat, cannot be removed from “preserved” status unless the entire cluster development is annexed. A copy of the land use and deed restrictions, including preservation areas must be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and recorded with the Scott County Clerk’s Office; a note shall be placed on the final subdivision plat indicating the recording reference. 
W. 	Preserved acreage has no Conditional Uses permitted. Those tracts are not eligible for consideration of Conditional Use Permits by the Board of Adjustment. 
X. 	The Planning Commission may require a master plan of the entire farm illustrating overall cluster/rural lot layout, access, internal road system, fencing, landscaping/buffering. 
Y. 	All cluster lots shall have access to internal roads only, no direct access (driveways) onto the existing public road. 
Z. 	Existing stone fences may not be removed or altered except where the proposed road is to be installed, including the required sight triangle. Any portions of a stone fence removed for the above 
reasons, must be replaced elsewhere on the property. 
AA. 	All applicants for cluster residential subdivision approval must provide a copy of the soils map for the subject property or a soil certification from the USDA-NRCS office prior to Planning Commission review and approval. Soils that are less desirable for agriculture are preferential for cluster lot location as a means of maintaining preserved acreage for agricultural purposes. 
BB. 	A Homeowner’s Agreement is required for cluster proposals.  Until such time as Scott County accepts any roads designed to public road standards, the ownership and maintenance of the roads, right­of-ways, and any drainage structures will be the responsibility of the homeowners.

SITE PREPARATION STANDARDS 

1100 	GRADING STANDARDS 
A. 	General 
1. 	
No physical disturbance shall occur on any site proposed for subdivision or development, including quarries, borrow pits, and mineral processing facilities, but not including single family dwelling construction, unless a grading plan and a water quality protection plan have been submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission Engineer. 

2. 	
The initial construction on any site shall be implementation of the approved water quality protection plan, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Planning Commission Engineer. 


B. 	SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 
Significant erosion results from rainfall and runoff over unprotected soil.  Erosion is increased by intense rainfalls, long slopes, steep slopes and lack of vegetative cover. These conditions are in part caused or aggravated by improper construction, grading, or excavation practices which fail to adequately provide for erosion control. 
This section of the Regulations is designed to reduce soil erosion in the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Area, and to provide procedures for submission, review, and approval of erosion control plans. 
SCOPE OF COVERAGE - The following are included within the scope of these regulations: All persons submitting subdivision or development plans must include a statement with the preliminary or minor plat stating that no grading, excavating, stripping, filling, or other disturbance of the natural ground cover shall take place prior to approval of an erosion control plan. The erosion control plan will be submitted along with the preliminary plat, or minor plat if applicable. 
EXCEPTIONS - No erosion control plan shall be required for the following: 
1. 	
Finished grading and excavation below finished grade (a) for basements and footings of a single-family or duplex residential structure, (b) for retaining walls, (c) for swimming pools, (d) for cemeteries for human or animal burial, or (e) for accessory structures related to single-family residences or duplex structures 

authorized by a valid building permit. 

2. 	
Individual single-family residential lots. 

3. 	
Accepted agricultural land management practices such as plowing, cultivation, construction or agricultural structures, nursery operations such as the removal and/or transplanting of cultivated sod, shrubs, and trees, tree cuttings at or above existing root mat intact. 

4. 	
Grading, as a maintenance measure, or for landscaping purposes on existing developed lots or parcels. 

5. 	
Installation of lateral sewer lines, telephone lines, electricity lines, gas lines or other public service facilities. 

6. 	
Subdivisions for which a preliminary or final plat is approved prior to the effective date of this regulation. 


ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES - Applications for approval of erosion control plan shall be submitted to the Georgetown-Scott County Joint Planning Commission. The application shall contain the applicant’s name and address and other relevant information requested on the application forms provided. It shall also contain a proposed erosion control plan containing the information required by section below (Contents of the Soil Erosion Plan). The plan shall be designed as suggested in Kentucky Division of Conversation and the Division of Water handbook dated August, 1994, Kentucky Best Management Practices for Construction Activities. The application must be signed by the owner of the property or an authorized agent, and the erosion control plans must be certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed landscape architect if submitted in association with a major subdivision or development plan.  Upon approval of the plan by the Planning Commission, the developer can begin work. 
CONTENTS OF THE SOIL EROSION PLAN. The following information must be included in the Soil Erosion Plan: 
1. 	
The erosion control plan shall be drawn at a scale of 1” - 100’ (or less) indicating (a) the site location as well as the adjacent properties; and (b) identification of any structure for natural feature on the land adjacent to the site and within 250’ which has a significant impact on drainage or siltation controls. If the development is to be in stages, the plan shall cover the entire tract to be developed. 

2. 	
Property boundary bearings and distances for the site on which the work is to be performed. 

3. 	
The anticipated time of exposure of each area prior to the completion of effective erosion and sediment control measures. 

4. 	
Existing topography at contour intervals not exceeding ten (10) feet; five feet where conditions warrant. 

5. 	
Location and identification of any proposed additional structures of development on the site, except single-family and two-family residential structures and their accessory structures in a subdivision (if applicable). 

6. 	
Plans and specifications for all drainage provisions, retaining walls, cribbing, planting, anti-erosion devices or other protective devices (whether temporary or permanent) to be constructed in connection with, or as a part of the proposed work, together with a map showing the drainage area of land tributary to the site and a statement explaining the amount of estimated runoff used to determine the design characteristics of any drainage device. Upstream drainage must be considered and explained if any adverse effect is possible. 

7. 	
Plans for removal, re-contouring or other final disposition of sediment basins or other structural improvements or devices included in the plan. 

8. 	
If a sedimentation basin is required, it should be designed by certified engineers in accordance with the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for Scott County. 


PRINCIPLES TO BE CONSIDERED IN REVIEWING APPLICATIONS 
1. 	
The erosion control plan should relate to the specific site conditions. 

2. 	
The plan should keep land grading and land disturbance to a minimum under the circumstances. 

3. 	
Both surface and storm water drainage systems should be integrated to accommodate the increased runoff incurred during land grading. 

4. 	
To prevent soil erosion existing, temporary and future protective vegetative cover should be emphasized. 

5. 	
The plan shall coordinate grading operation and sediment control measures so as to minimize land exposure to erosion. 

6. 	
Sediment basins below high sediment-producing areas should be planned. 

7. 	
The plan should utilize available technology to keep soil erosion to a minimum level. 


SPECIAL CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO PLANS - Upon consideration of the factors listed above and for the purposes of this ordinance, conditions may be attached to the approval of erosion control plans. It is intended that these conditions be added to a plan for certain areas or problems to provide two basic results: (1) that during project construction, off-site and on-site siltation and erosion be minimized; and (2) that after project completion, the total erosion control plan will be effective so as to preclude all significant on-site erosion. 
 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
The cost of compliance with the erosion control plan shall be included in security that shall be provided in addition to any security required under Article VI of these regulations and prior to issuance of a grading permit or land disturbance permit (City of Georgetown Ordinance 2010-014).  The terms and sufficiency of security under this section shall be consistent with the requirements of Section 600.D. of these regulations.  A registered engineer shall estimate the cost of compliance with the approved Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and shall include this amount in computing the total of the approved security as required in Article VI of these regulations. At such time that the developer has completed all requirements of the approved SWPPP and satisfied all terms of the security document, the security shall be released upon certification by the Planning Commission Engineer. 
In the event of failure to complete work or failure to comply with all requirements, conditions, and terms of the permit or plan, the Planning Commission Engineer may order the stoppage of work; the Planning Commission Engineer may order such work as in its opinion, is necessary to eliminate any dangerous conditions or to achieve compliance with the intent of this ordinance; the Planning Commissioner Engineer may instruct the Division of Building Inspections to refuse to issue any additional building permits. 
The permittee shall continue to be firmly bound under the continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary cost and expenses that may be incurred or expended by the Planning Commission in causing the work to be done. In cases where there is no bond or other surety posted, the Fiscal Court or City Council of the relevant jurisdiction shall put a lien on the property to cover necessary cost of complying with the ordinance where (1) the permittee fails to complete the work or comply, and the final plan has not been approved, or (2) where the erosion control plan has been approved in association with the development plan, and the work outlined in an approved erosion control plan has not been completed to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission Engineer or Building Inspector. 
In cases where a permittee fails to comply with an approved SWPPP and there is security posted, the Planning Commission Engineer shall estimate the cost of complying with the erosion control plan and draw that amount from the security to ensure the timely completion of the work if the permittee fails to do so after receiving notification to complete the work within 20 days from the date of the letter, or within a shorter time frame if so required by the applicable city council/city commission/fiscal court.

C. 	Storm Water Manual 
1. 	Requirements: Developments that occur within Scott County are required to provide the Planning Commission a Storm Water Management Plan that addresses all the elements of the hydrologic cycle. These elements include, and are not limited to, the following: 
a) Groundwater recharge b) Water quality protection c) Channel protection d) Water quantity control 
The plan is to include construction drawings showing all details on how to construct the proposed improvements and a drainage report providing all necessary calculations to comply with each element. All stormwater management plans are to be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission Engineer. The Georgetown City Engineer must also approve plans for developments that are within the Georgetown City Limits. 
Construction Plans: All Storm Water Management Plans shall provide details related to all aspects of the construction. Developments are to be designed to ensure that controls are in place that would prevent or minimize water quality impacts. Designers are to develop and implement strategies, which include a combination of structural and/or non-structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) appropriate for the community. The plans must also ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of BMPs through notes or labels on construction drawings, Final Subdivision Plats, and Final Development Plans. 
Drainage Reports: Studies are required to provide calculations supporting the use of the BMPs specified in the plans. These studies are to be submitted in conjunction with the Construction Plans for proposed developments. The following is a list of minimum criteria to be included in all drainage reports: 
i. 	Summary tables outlining all hydrologic quantities needed to support the storm water management plans. 
ii. 	Soil survey maps showing the existing soil conditions for a proposed development. 
iii. 	Ponding elevations for each of the proposed storm water structures, storm water facilities, and closed contour areas. 
iv. 	
Flow depths for all open channel conditions that are a part of the proposed plans. 

v. 	
Identification of all the swales, diversion ditches, roadway ditches, 100 year drainage ways, and floodplains. 


vi. 	valuation of storm water systems that receive runoff from proposed developments; systems being defined as any type of structure or open channel that conveys runoff. 
vii. 	re- and post-developed watershed maps showing all parameters used by designers to produce their storm water plans. 
viii. 	Maps that show all subcatchments draining to each proposed structure. 
ix. 	Label the analysis points where the study terminates. All points of analysis are to be set to evaluate the potential of compounding peak flow conditions downstream of developments. Analysis points are to be approved by the Planning Commission Engineer. 
Additional Requirements: All developments must also incorporate the following criteria into their designs: 
a) 	Finish floor elevations for proposed single family and multifamily residential units are to be at least two feet above the 100-year water surface elevations of all waterways, overflow conditions, overland flow areas, and ponding areas. 
b) 	Commercial facilities are to be evaluated for protection from 100 year flooding conditions. 
c) 	Designs are not to include any fill to be placed in 100 year drainage ways and floodplains, unless proposed construction complies with Article XII, Section 1200 of the Subdivision and Development Regulations, and any and all permits from the Federal, State, and Local agencies are obtained prior to construction. 
d) 	Other than what is described in item #3, any and all permits required by Federal, State, and Local agencies for developments must be obtained prior to the commencement of that process regulated by the permits. 
A. 	Groundwater Recharge: Base flows of local streams and waterways are fed by groundwater sources. Developments can cause changes in the amount of water that would be used to support base flows. As the impervious area of a site increases, so does the volume of runoff. To maintain adequate base flows and stream ecosystems, developments must incorporate practices in their storm water management plan to provide for treated groundwater recharge. The amount of recharge that a site is capable of providing depends on topographic factors such as slope, types of vegetation, hydrological soil groups, and locations of rock layers. The average annual recharge volume for a site can be estimated by taking the average annual recharge rate of the hydrological soil group(s), dividing that by the average annual rainfall (44.05 inches), and then multiplying that result by 90 percent. The following table provides a summary of the recharge requirements:

The soil specific recharge is determined by calculating a volume to be treated and infiltrated by a structural practice or by a percent area method involving a non-structural practice. The following formula is to be used for a structural practice: 

12.Sin .. 0.05. 0.009. I ..A.
GRV . 1 
GRV = Groundwater recharge volume, acre-ft. 
Sin = Soil specific recharge, in. 
I = Percent impervious, %. 
A = Total area of site, acre. 

Examples of structural practices that can be used for groundwater recharge are bioretention areas, infiltration facilities, terraformed berms, and infiltration swales. 
Since Scott County is in a karst region, designers that intend to use structural practices for groundwater recharge must evaluate potential areas to ensure that these proposed facilities would be adequate and not have an adverse impact on surrounding areas, such as increasing the water table. Designers are to ensure that the groundwater recharge volume is to exit proposed facilities through natural infiltration or a designed outlet, and that the volume is treated by BMPs prior to infiltration. Dewatering times for structural practices should not exceed 48 hours. Groundwater recharge requirements may be waived for 
redevelopments only if approved by the Planning Commission Engineer. 
B. 	Water Quality Protection: The water chemistry of runoff is extremely important to the health of creeks and streams. When enough rainfall occurs, runoff from land areas is transported from these sites to drainage ways. These drainage ways eventually reach the creek systems of Scott County. Depending on the types of sites, pollutants are transported by the force of the runoff or by its physical factors such as temperature and pH level. Water quality BMPs are to be used to the maximum extent practical to minimize these impacts and to treat runoff from all proposed impervious surfaces. 
For adequate treatment, 90 percent of the average annual rainfall must be treated by stormwater BMPs. Rainfall records from GMWSS water treatment plant show that approximately 90 percent of total storm events occurred with 1 inch of rainfall or less. 

The following equation is used to determine the water quality volume needed to be treated for a development: 
WQV .
112... .0.009.I ..A.P 0.05 
WQV = Water quality volume, acre-ft. 
P = 90 percent of total storm events, 1 inch. 

I = Percent impervious, %. A = Total area of site, acre. 
The following table(1) lists the amounts of impervious areas that can expected from different types of development, and the water quality depth in inches per given area:

(2): Excluding right-of-way. 
Note: Water quality volume must be accounted for by storm water credits and/or BMPs. 

Targeted Pollutants: Designers are to use structural and non-structural BMPs to the maximum extent practical to treat the water quality volume. Individual treatments, or a combination of BMPs, can be used to achieve this goal. 
Different land uses can generate different types of runoff pollutants. For instance, a proposed refueling station would produce a higher concentration of hydrocarbons per acre than a proposed residential subdivision. Selection of BMPs should be based on the anticipated pollutants for a site. Some examples of typical pollutants for different applications are: 
1) 	Residential 
i) Setteable solids 

ii) Total suspended solids 
iii) Nitrogen 
iv) Phosphorous 
v) Metals 

2) 	Commercial and industrial i) Hydrocarbons ii) Trash iii) Setteable solids iv) Total suspended solids v) Nitrogen vi) Phosphorous vii) Metals 
Additional Storm Water Controls for Specific Commercial Areas: Specific design criteria for the following types of development are to be used: 
1) Restaurants/grocery stores i) Dumpster pad areas are to drain into the proposed storm sewer system. ii) A pretreatment device is to be used at dumpster locations that drain into the storm sewer system. iii) Pretreatment device is only to receive surface water from dumpster pad. iv) Configuration and pretreatment to be approved by Scott County Health Department. v) Operation and maintenance criteria to be included in the Construction Plans and Final Development Plans. 
2) 	Refueling stations i) Canopy refueling areas are to drain to the sanitary sewer. ii) Grade elevations are set to ensure that the only surface area 
draining into the sanitary system is from the pad itself. iii) No external rainwater can drain into the sanitary lines. iv) A pretreatment device is to be used for discharges draining into 
the sanitary system. v) Configuration and pretreatment to be approved by GMWSS. vi) Operation and maintenance criteria to be included in the 
Construction Plans and Final Development Plans. 
3) 	Repair shops/oil change facilities/car lots i) Interior vehicle areas are to drain into the sanitary system. ii) A pretreatment device is to be used for discharges draining into 
the sanitary system. iii) Configuration and pretreatment to be approved by GMWSS. iv) Operation and maintenance criteria to be included in the 
construction drawings and Final Development Plans. 
4) 	Automotive and truck wash facilities i) Covered wash bays are to drain into the sanitary sewer system. ii) Grade elevations set to ensure that the only surface areas 
draining into the sanitary system is from the bays themselves. iii) No external rainwater can drain into the sanitary lines. iv) A pretreatment device is to be used for discharges draining into 
the sanitary system. v) Configuration and pretreatment to be approved by GMWSS. vi) Operation and maintenance criteria to be included in the 
construction drawings and Final Development Plans. 
Treated groundwater recharge volumes can count towards the required water quality volumes; however, neither the groundwater recharge or water quality volumes are to be included in the channel protection and the water quantity control portion of the regulations. 
C. 	Channel Protection: Developments that require impervious areas and compacted fills reduce the amount of rainfall that previously infiltrated into the underlying soils. The rainfall is then converted into runoff, which eventually drains into the Scott County creek systems. Frequent rainfall events help to shape stream geometries. Uncontrolled events after development can cause degradation to channel areas. To protect channels from this degradation, developments are to provide extended detention for the 1 year/ 24 hour event, and allow the runoff produced to dewater over a 12 hour period. Storm water facilities designed for this condition will release flow at a rate not to exceed erosive flow rates in downstream channels. Channel protection may be waived but not limited to proposed sites that have less than 2 cfs for the post developed state. 
Designers are encouraged to protect channel and stream areas by not designing developments that require fill in headwater stream channels, to within 50 feet of the bankfull conditions (1.5 to 2 year return periods) of minor waterways, and floodplains. Developments that utilize this option may qualify for density credits or other considerations similar to a Planned Urban Development (PUD). 
Channel and stream areas that are disturbed due to grading and/or other construction activities must be stabilized and comply with Article XII, Section 1200 of the Subdivision and Development Regulations. 
References: 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual Volumes I & II. Center for Watershed Protection. 
D. 	Water Quantity Control: Typically with development, the volume of runoff increases due to the addition of impervious areas, the compaction of soil materials, and removal of vegetative cover. Some rainfall that once percolated into the ground would now travel over the surface. Developments must provide stormwater features that reduce the peak flow rates after development to what the runoff rates were prior to construction. In addition to the 1 year channel protection requirement, storm events that need to be adhered to are the 10, 25, and 100 year/ 24 hour events. Rainfall intensities for those events are to be taken from Division of Water Engineering Memorandum No. 2, current edition or most recent version. In the past, there have been storms that exceeded these design storm events. Designers are encouraged to analyze proposed developments with such rainfall intensities, if they feel that it is necessary for safe guarding any proposed infrastructure. 
Storm Sewer Design: Proposed storm sewers systems that have the potential of being maintained by any municipality or government utility in Scott County must adhere to the following guidelines: 
1) 	All proposed storm lines are to be reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), ADS-N12 or high density polyethylene equivalent, A­2000, or aluminized type II corrugated metal pipe (CMP) with bituminous coating. Please note that CMP can only be used when a designer calls for a 48 inch line or greater in an urbanized area with the approval of the Planning Commission Engineer and City Engineer. CMP is not permitted in rural areas. 
2) Minimum pipe diameter for proposed lines is 12 inches. 3) The maximum length between any storm sewer structures, serving less than a 48 inch line, is 300 feet. 
4) 	Bedding details and joint specifications are to be provided with all construction drawings and shall comply with manufacturing recommendations. 
5) 	A storm sewer structure must be used if a proposed storm line extends beyond the maximum length, is altered in horizontal or vertical alignment, or changes in pipe material. Structures are also to be used at the beginning and ending points for proposed storm lines. 
6) 	Proposed systems are to be designed to handle the 10 year/ 24 hour event capacity with no flow above crown of pipe. Flow interception for structures must be based on bypass conditions. No proposed system is to surcharge in the 100 year/ 24 hour event. 
7) 	Designers are to design storm sewers that prevent the 100 year/ 24 hour runoff from crossing roadway crowns for local and continuous streets. For collectors and arterials, runoff spread and ponding are restricted to 6 feet from the face of curb in the 10 year/ 24 hour event. 
8) 	100 year/ 24 hour water surface elevations are to be determined for all proposed storm sewer structures, such as headwalls and surface inlets. 
9) 	In residential subdivisions that include curb and gutter as part of their roadway design, proposed storm lines are to be daylighted at the rear of proposed lots. 
10) 	Overflow swales are to be provided at sag locations in commercial and residential subdivisions. 
11) 	The Planning Commission Engineer and Public Works Department or equivalent must approve the types of structures proposed for storm water systems that could be maintained by a municipality of Scott County. 
Culverts and Bridges: Proposed channel and stream crossings are to include a means to convey the 100-year flow. Culverts are typically used in situations where drainage ways do not have any base flows associated with them. Head conditions occur on the upstream side to force the peak flow through the structure(s). Proposed culverts are to be designed so that the 100-year water surface elevation is one foot below the overtopping elevation of the embankment. Bridge structures are to be used at creek and stream crossings where base flow conditions do exist (base flow being defined as water being present in channel and stream areas during dry weather conditions). These structures are to be designed to convey the 100-year flow rate unimpeded, and allow the 100-year water surface elevation to be one foot below the bottom of the slab. All proposed bridges are to be certified by the designer after construction. Prior to construction all permits are to be obtained from Corps of Engineers and/or Division of Water, if applicable. 
Other design considerations that apply to culverts and bridges are listed in the following: 
1) Live load considerations for anticipated construction traffic, fire 
service vehicles, refuse trucks, commercial vehicles, etc. 
2) Public protection for pedestrian and bicycle traffic, if applicable. 
3) Headwalls for the upstream and downstream sides of proposed 

culverts. Fences or railing are to be provided for headwall that are 
for 30 inch lines or greater. 4) Railing design for bridges. 5) End treatments for culverts to minimize erosion and sediment 
transport. 6) Scouring protection for bridge piers and abutments. 7) Fish passage. 8) Streambank stabilization designs for backwater areas and accelerated flows downstream. 
There are areas within Scott County, particularly in the north, where 
existing roadways are already in place and lying in the floodplain. In 
situations where roads must be improved due to development, any portion 
of the roadway that is flooded by the 100 year event or less must be 
reconstructed to provide a concrete cap with a footer design on the 
upstream side, to reduce the potential of a roadway being washed out. 

Open Channel Design: Developments that use open channels to convey 
runoff must adhere to the following guidelines: 

1) Convey the 100 year event. 
2) Designs not to exceed the channel lining’s critical shear force and 

permissible velocity in the 10 year event. 3) Select the appropriate roughness values for proposed channels. 4) Provide any armoring needed for hydraulic jump and bend 
conditions. 
E. 	Storm Water Credits: Storm water credits are water quality reductions permitted through specific site design criteria. These credits are established to help reduce the impacts on Scott County’s stream systems. The credits are calculated based on the procedures outlined and subtracted from the water quality requirements for a development. The following is a list of the stormwater credits that are permitted for this community: 
1) Filter strips 
2) Vegetated channels 
3) Riparian buffers 
4) Terraformed Areas 
5) Rooftop disconnections 
6) Modular/porous pavements 

Note: Storm water credits are set to encourage “greener” site designs; however, they are not intended to be a substitution for the water quality protection of the regulations. All drainage from proposed impervious areas must be treated by a storm water BMP. 
1. Filter Strips: Filter strips are undisturbed grass areas that receive runoff from a development in the form of sheet flow. It is important to note that the filter area must remain undisturbed during construction to allow natural percolation to occur. 
Credit definition: 1) Impervious areas draining to the filter strip are deducted from 
the total impervious area used to determine the water quality volume. 2) An additional 0.075 acre-ft per acre of filter strip is also deducted from the remainder of the water quality volume. 
Credit criteria: 1) Minimum filter strip widths are 50 feet. 2) Runoff draining across filter strips shall be in the form of sheet 
flow only. 
3) The maximum contributing length draining to filter strips shall be 150 feet for residential development and 75 feet for commercial development. Designers are permitted to design filter strips to treat larger areas as long as they follow the design procedure outlined for Riparian Buffers. 
4) Slopes greater than 5 percent are to incorporate a means by which runoff is dispersed into sheet flow, for example, a level spreader or 30 feet grass buffer. 
5) Filter strips near channels or drainage ways are to be set outside bankfull conditions. 6) The infiltration rate for the underlying soil must not be less than 
0.25 in/hr. 
7) Areas draining to filter strips that include rooftops of homes and buildings must have notes on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans stating that the roof drains are to be directed towards the filter strip areas. 
8) Filter strips shall be set in easements, or in some other means for protection, on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans. 
2. Vegetated Channels: Vegetated channels can be used for water quality treatment. These types of channels apply to roadway ditches, drainage ways in the rear of lots, conveyance systems for parking lot drainage, etc. 
Credit definition: 
1) Impervious areas draining through vegetated channels are deducted from the total impervious area used to determine the water quality volume. 
2) An additional 0.25 acre-ft per acre of channel area needed to convey the one inch storm event is also deducted from the remainder of the water quality volume. 
Credit criteria: 
1) The geometry of the channels must be either parabolic or 

trapezoidal. 2) Channel side slopes are not to exceed 3:1. 3) The velocity of flow in the channel must be 1.0 feet per second 
or less for the runoff produced by the one inch storm event. 
4) The 10 year/ 24 hr event is not to exceed the tractive force or permissible velocity of the vegetative cover or the underlying soil, whichever is greater. 
5) No headwalls are to be in the direct path of the water quality discharge areas. 6) The infiltration rate for the underlying soil must not be less than 
0.25 in/hr. 
7) Areas draining to vegetated channels that include rooftops of homes and buildings must have notes on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans stating that the roof drains are to be directed towards the open channel areas. 
8) Channels shall be set in drainage easements on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans, stating that there will be no obstructions or structures permitted in the easements including fences. 
Sizing calculations: In order to satisfy Credit criteria #3, the curve number representing an area that is intended to be treated by a vegetated channel must be modified in order to get an accurate peak flow rate for the 1 inch storm.

3. Riparian Buffers: This credit applies to developments that incorporate riparian buffer practices as a part of its design. The criteria are similar to filter strips except that it is a higher credit for water quality quantity. 
Credit definition: 
1) Impervious areas draining to the filter strip are deducted from the total impervious area used to determine the water quality volume. 
2) An additional 0.25 acre-ft per acre of buffer is also deducted from the remainder of the water quality volume.

 Credit criteria: 1) Runoff draining across riparian buffers shall be in the form of sheet flow only. 
2) The velocity of flow in the in the buffers must be 1.0 feet per second or less for the runoff produced by the one inch storm event. 
3) Slopes greater than 5 percent are to incorporate a means by which runoff is dispersed into sheet flow, for example, a level spreader or 30 feet grass buffer. 
4) Riparian widths are to be based on a residence time of 9 minutes. 
5) Vines and shrubs are to be planted with a minimum density of 1700 stems per acre (one planting per 25 square feet at 5 feet on center), and trees planted at 450 stems per acre (one planting every 100 square feet at 10 feet on center). 
6) For diversity, six or more species from the planting list on pages 13 to 15 must be used for each riparian design. 7) Riparian buffers near channels or drainage ways are to be set outside bankfull conditions. 8) The infiltration rate for the underlying soil must not be less than 
0.25 in/hr. 
9) Areas draining to riparian buffers that include rooftops of homes and buildings must have notes on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans stating that the roof drains are to be directed towards the riparian buffer areas. 
10) Riparian buffers shall be set in easements, or in some other means for protection, on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans.

4. Terraformed Areas: Terraformed areas are places within a development that have been graded to promote stormwater infiltration, such as terracing and berming. Runoff is retained within a bermed area and allowed to percolate into the soil. Bermed swales, storage areas, and side-saddle impoundment areas are examples of this stormwater practice. 
 Credit definition: 
1) The runoff volume, impounded by terraformed areas, is deducted from the groundwater recharge and water quality volumes. 
2) An additional 0.25 acre-ft per acre of terraformed area is also deducted from the remainder of the water quality volume. 
 Credit criteria: 
1) Slopes greater than 5 percent are to incorporate a means by which runoff is dispersed into sheet flow, for example, a level spreader or 30 feet grass buffer. 
2) Terraformed areas near channels or drainage ways are to be set outside the 10 year water surface elevation areas. 3) The infiltration rate for the underlying soil must not be less than 
0.25 in/hr. 
4) Areas draining to terraformed areas that include rooftops of homes and buildings must have notes on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans stating that the roof drains are to be directed towards the terraformed areas. 
5) Terraformed areas must drain within 48 hours. 
6) Terraformed areas shall be set in easements, or in some other means for protection, on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans. 
5. Rooftop Disconnections: Downspouts from homes for single family detached developments including duplexes that do not tie into a storm sewer, or drain directly to impervious areas, will have a credit towards the water quality calculations. 
 Credit definition: 
1) 	Rooftop areas draining directly across yard areas are deducted from the total impervious area used to determine the water quality volume. 
2) 	The maximum credit may not exceed roof areas of typical homes for proposed residential developments. 
 Credit criteria: 
1) Yard areas receiving rooftop runoff are to be at least . of the roof areas. 2) Discharges must at least travel across 30 feet of grass areas before reaching any impervious surfaces. 
3) This credit cannot be counted if the design for the proposed development already takes into account a BMP treatment for drainage areas that include proposed homes. 
4) Rooftops draining onto yard areas must have notes on Final Subdivision Plats and/or Final Development Plans stating that the roof drains are to be directed towards the yard areas. 
Modular/Porous Pavements: Modular/porous pavement designs can be used for developments to promote infiltration of runoff. The performance of these pavements will depend on the application for which they are used, the construction parameters, and the manufacture’s specifications. These designs are permitted in commercial and industrial areas, only upon the review and approval by the Planning Commission.

SPECIAL AREAS AND USES 

1200 ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS 

A. 	CREEK CONSERVATION CORRIDORS AND MINOR WATERWAYS 
1. 	
Definition - Creek Conservation Corridors are those designated in the Comprehensive Plan and zoned C-1. Minor waterways are defined as all U.S.G.S. blue line streams. 

2. 	
Preliminary plats/plans shall verify the actual location of the 100­year floodplain and C-1 zone on the property. 

3. 	
Development, including but not limited to, location and design of utilities, paved areas, and structures, shall not remove or damage creekbank vegetation and shall not adversely affect the scenic and recreational character of creek conservation corridors. During development, vegetation management (selected, minor removal of trees or plants, removal of nuisance or health hazard species, new plantings, etc.) may be permitted by the Commission where it meets the overall purposes of the C-1 zone, including to substantially preserve or enhance the natural character and habitat value of the riparian area. 

4. 	
There shall be no fill or obstruction of the 100-year floodplain in creek conservation corridors except under at least one of the following conditions: 


a. 	
Where minimal grading results in no net loss of floodplain storage volumes, does not disturb or damage creekbank vegetation, and does not alter the natural floodchannel or stream hydrology. 

b. 	
Where, for pre-existing commercial zoning within the conservation corridor, the negative impacts of the fill or obstruction are minimal and are mitigated by contribution of significant public benefits substantially meeting the policies and objectives of the conservation corridor as stated in the Comprehensive Plan. 


5. 	
Septic systems shall not be located within 100-year floodplains. 

6. 	
Flood control, storm drainage, and bridge improvements shall be designed for minimum disturbance of natural creek banks and 

vegetation. Where creekbanks are altered or vegetation disturbed, re-planting and bank stabilization, using bio-engineering techniques (use of natural vegetation) rather than rechannelization, concrete, riprap, etc., where feasible, shall be required. 

7. 	
Lakes may be developed within creek conservation corridors except where unique indigenous habitats would be destroyed. 

8. 	
See Article XI Sec 1100, C.2.c.v for requirements of foundation setbacks from creekbanks. 


B. 	SCOTT COUNTY RESERVOIR PROTECTION AREA 
1.

3. 	
New package sewage treatment plants and pump stations shall not be located within the protection area and shall not discharge to any land or waterway within the protection area, except for new sewage treatment plants and collector system pump stations already authorized by zoning approvals, which shall comply with Appendix IX of these regulations. 


C. 	AQUIFER RECHARGE AREAS 
1. 	
Definition - The land from which surface water percolates through rock and soil to feed underground water resources, as shown on Maps 1 and 2 of the Environmental Quality Element of the Comprehensive Plan, or as demonstrated by topography, geology, dye tracing, or other accepted means. 

2. 	
In the A-1 zone, if the property is partially located outside an aquifer recharge area, septic systems shall be located on that part of the property. 

3. 	
Urban runoff and storm drainage shall be directed away from sinkholes within aquifer recharge areas, where such runoff poses a substantial risk of contaminating underground water quality. 

4. 	
Septic systems within the drainage area of sinkholes shall be located to prevent contamination of aquifers or contamination of ponded water within the drainfield. No septic systems shall be located within a sinkhole. 


D. WETLANDS 
Wetlands are areas with a predominance of hydric soils that are saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support hydrophytic vegetation. Known wetlands are mapped by the Scott County Soil Conservation District. They must be shown on Plats and Plans. 
E. SIGNIFICANT TREES AND FENCE ROWS 
Remaining fence rows, trees lining roads, major tree stands, and significant trees in the southern half of the County shall be preserved and incorporated in landscape plans for new development where feasible, consistent with vegetation management that is appropriate to the development and use. 
F. STEEP SLOPES AND CLAY SOILS 
See Article XI, Section 1000.C.2 for standards for grading, fill, foundations, etc. for steep slopes and clay soils. 
G. ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS 
Environmentally sensitive areas are defined as those features located on a property including sinkholes, cave areas, major rock formations and outcroppings, springs, floodplains/floodways, landfills/refuse areas,. Properties proposed for development that include environmentally sensitive areas are encouraged to “design around” those areas and designate them as “non-buildable” whenever possible in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts on the area or within the development.       
Due to the nature of portions of Georgetown and Scott County, including Stamping Ground and Sadieville, steep slope areas are referenced here but not formally included within the definition of an environmentally sensitive area. For areas with existing steep slopes (i.e., those exceeding 10 percent), those areas shall be shown on the zone change application/concept plan or master plan, preliminary development plan or subdivision plat approval, and required construction plans, as noted below. 
 Existing steep slope areas include those areas greater than 100’ in length and width. 
Applicants for development proposals and/or their representatives shall provide the Planning Commission staff with information regarding environmentally sensitive areas and existing steep slope areas as follows: 
a. 	
(recommended) zone change application/concept plan or master plan approval, including a map showing the specific location of the of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas. 

b. 	
(required) preliminary development plan or subdivision plat approval. 


The information shall include at a minimum a map showing the specific location of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas that will be further studied and examined. 
For existing steep slopes, the map shall include the slope of the property at 100’ intervals across the slope; the Planning Commission Engineer may require intervals less than 100’ if deemed necessary. 
c. 	
(required) construction plan approval. The information shall include specific location and extent or boundary(s) of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas, method used to determine the extent or boundary(s) of the feature and proposed remediation, if applicable. Additional information regarding protective measures during construction, as applicable, shall be included as part of the construction plans. 

i. 	
Examination of sinkholes, springs and other similar features shall be completed by a licensed geo-technical engineer. The Planning Commission shall require the geo-technical engineer to submit a complete report of the findings, proposed remediation and verification of remediation (i.e., certification of inspection of the remediation materials and construction standards). Two (2) copies of the analysis and study, including any remediation methods shall be submitted to the Planning Commission Engineer for review and recordkeeping. Verification and certification of any remediation methods is required prior to final development plan or subdivision plat approval. 

d. 	
(required) final development plan or subdivision plat approval. Environmentally sensitive areas shall be shown on the final development plan or final subdivision plat.  Existing steep slope areas must be shown or referenced on the final development plan or final subdivision plat, if required by the Planning Commission or Planning Commission Engineer. For sinkholes and other similar features the final development plan or final subdivision plat shall include approval and signature of Appendix III – Form M Sinkhole Certification by the geo-technical engineer who performed the analysis of the area. A note shall be placed on the final development plan or subdivision plat indicating these areas, referencing the required study, including the date performed. 


For areas with a sinkhole, multiple sinkholes and/or a sinkhole cluster, the following requirements shall apply: Definitions: 
Sinkhole: any closed depression formed by removal (typically underground) of water, surficial soil, rock, or other material.  The existing of a sinkhole shall be as indicated by the closed depression contour line(s) as shown on the USGS, KGS, GSCPC-GIS Section mapping or other documents as approved by the Planning Commission Engineer and/or City Engineer, as applicable. The actual limits may however be determined by field measurements with concurrence of the Planning Commission Engineer and/or City Engineer. Sinkholes may be either circular in plan or irregular, depending upon structural control. 
Immediate Sinkhole Drainage Area: any area that contributes surface water directly to the sinkhole(s) not including areas which contribute surface water indirectly to a sinkhole (via streams or other means). 
Sinkhole Cluster Area: Any area that contributes surface water other than by way of a stream to a sinkhole that is located in a group of two or more sinkholes clustering together or in a line. Sinkholes are natural depressions which drain a significant portion of the mid- to lower areas of Scott County, including the City of Georgetown and Stamping Ground. Sinkholes and sinkhole systems are part of a complex drainage system that is tied to caves, springs and underground streams.  Flooding, subsidence and water pollution are the major problems associated with sinkhole area developments.  Those problems are generally illustrated in Exhibit 1 (source: Development Impacts in Sinkhole Areas – Knoxville/Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission, May 1995). 
Requirements: 
1. 	An applicant seeking subdivision plat or development plan approval: 
a. 	
May divert enough of the sinkhole drainage area so that the development of the remaining area does not increase the total quantity of runoff into the sinkhole. For approval of this type of proposal, the applicant shall provide for approval, a study which must show that the development will not aggravate flooding on the proposed development, adjacent properties or lands, or connected/adjacent sinkhole clusters or systems. 

b. 	
Where the sinkhole outlet is offsite, either the runoff leaving the subject property must be shown to be no greater in flow or in quantity than that which is exerted before the development. 

c. 	
Sinkhole limits and non-buildable areas are to be defined by a certified geologist and/or geotechnical engineer. The sinkhole limits shall be identified as outlined in sections g.i., and h.i., of this ordinance. The plats and plans shall provide a reference to the required study detailing the method(s) of the investigation used to define said limits. 

d. 	
Sinkhole limits and non-buildable areas are to be identified on the preliminary or final development plan, preliminary or final subdivision plat, and construction plans by shading or other means to clearly identify those areas. 

e. 	
Post-developed discharges shall be treated prior to draining into the sinkhole limits. 

f. 	
Structures located adjacent to the closed contour of a sinkhole or adjacent to an immediate sinkhole drainage area shall not be permitted to have a basement or first floor elevation lower than an elevation, USGS Datum or other comparable source, to be determined on a case-by-case basis, said elevation being at least one (1) foot above the 100 year 24-hour storm event (maximum) assuming no outflow from the sinkhole. Minimum Floor Elevations for such lots are to be referenced and shown on the plat. 

g. 	
The applicant or applicant’s representative shall verify any requirement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including but not limited to ground water injection permit(s). 

h. 	
In the event that a sinkhole, immediate sinkhole drainage area, sinkhole cluster area, or portions of such items are not shown on the referenced maps and documentation but are determined or discovered during the course of construction, the applicant shall: 


i. 	Notify the Planning Commission Engineer and City Engineer, where applicable, immediately. 
ii. 	Shall provide all documentation, studies, and any related information to the Planning Commission Engineer and City Engineer, where applicable, as if the sinkhole, immediate sinkhole drainage area, sinkhole cluster area, or portions of such items were identified prior to approval and noted on the preliminary development plan and/or preliminary subdivision plat. 
1. Upon determination of a sinkhole, immediate sinkhole drainage area, sinkhole cluster area, or portions of such items, as noted in section f.ii., any approvals of a preliminary or final development plan, preliminary or final subdivision plat, or construction plans shall not constitute automatic approval and shall not be grounds for the continuation of any construction or development activity within the identified area until such time as the required documentation, including detailed study, have been reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission Engineer and City Engineer, where applicable. 
i. 	
For residential areas (i.e., single family detached, attached and multi-family developments): 

i. 	A sinkhole, immediate sinkhole drainage area, sinkhole cluster area, or portions of such items shall be shown on the preliminary and final development plan and/or preliminary and final subdivision plat, and construction plans where they exist. 
ii. 	The sinkhole and its defined limits (i.e., closed contours) shall be noted as “non-buildable” and may not be treated, filled, or enclosed.  No structure, right­of-way, including roads (public or private) may be located within the defined limits of a sinkhole. 
1. For the purpose of calculating density for a development, areas identified as sinkholes, including its defined limits, and noted as non­buildable may be counted towards the total net acreage of the development. 

j. 	
For non-residential developments (i.e., professional office, commercial, industrial): 


i. 	A sinkhole, immediate sinkhole drainage area, sinkhole cluster area, or portions of such items shall be shown on the preliminary and final development plan and/or preliminary and final subdivision plat where they exist. 
ii. 	The sinkhole may be treated only upon review and approval of a study certified by a licensed geotechnical engineer as to the sinkhole limits, and proposed treatment/remediation methods. Upon completion of the treatment, certification that the proposed work was completed in accordance with the study and recommendations.

ROAD AND STREET DESIGN 

1. Geometry 
a.  Horizontal Curve Radius - A curve with a radius adequate to ensure safe sight distances shall be made. The relationship between curve radius, length of curve and percentage slope shall conform to the standards in Exhibit A-1. The minimum radii of curves shall be:  
   Street Type    Minimum Curve Radius  
   Residential Collector & Non-Residential  300'  
Others  100'  
b.  Vertical Curves - All changes in grade for streets shall be connected by a vertical curve of a minimum length necessary to provide adequate sight distance. The minimum curve length shall be calculated as follows:  
i  Calculate the algebraic difference in grades.  
ii  Multiply by the appropriate value.  
Values for crest curve in      Collector Streets  45  
Values for sag curves in      Collector Streets      Other Streets  45 22  
In no case, shall the minimum length of a vertical curve be less than 100'.  
c.  Stopping Sight Distance - The minimum stopping sight distance shall be 250' for collector streets and 200' for all other streets.  
d.  Cul-de-Sacs Cul-de-sac turnarounds shall have a minimum roadway radius of 40', face of curb to face of curb (reverse curve radius of 85' joining to straight line), and a right-of-way radius of 50' (reverse curve radius of 75' joining to straight line), except in the case of cul-de-sacs over 150' in length which shall have a minimum roadway radius of 45', face of curb to face of curb, a right-of-way radius of 55' (reverse curve radii of 80' and 70' respectively).  


e. Grades - The maximum street grades shall conform to the following: 
  Street Type    Desirable Maximum  
Residential Collector Street Others  5 8  Allowable maximum shall confer to the requirements of Exhibit A-1 to a  maximum of 10% for a collector and 15% for others.  

All streets shall be designed for a minimum grade of eight-tenths (8/10) of one (1) percent. The maximum grade within 50 feet of an intersection shall be three (3) percent. 
f. 	
Intersection Angles and Number of Legs - For a tangent intersection of at least 100 feet, measure from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, all streets shall intersect at a desired angle 90 degrees and a minimum angle of 75 degrees. The maximum number of street legs shall be 4. 

g. 	
Corner Sight Distances at Intersections -


The minimum standards for corner sight distance are determined by the posted speed for the streets which intersect. For intersections where no speed limit is posted, a minimum design speed of 30 MPH shall be required. In no event shall the required sight distance be less than 250 feet. The following minimum distances are required: 
  Design Speed Corner Intersection MPH Sight Distance (Feet)* 
  25 mph or less 250 30 300 35 350 40 400 45 450 50 500 55 550 60 600 
*Sight distance measured to the right and to the left of the proposed intersection (example: 20 mph design speed would require a minimum of 250’ of sight distance to the right and a minimum of 250’ of sight distance to the left). 
Note: This table assumes right angle intersections and straight major street movement within the sight distance. Situations involving skewed intersections, curvilinear streets and other extenuating factors may be required to have additional sight distance beyond that required above, in the discretion of the Planning Commission Engineer or City Engineer.
