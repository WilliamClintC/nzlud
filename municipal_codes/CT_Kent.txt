KENT, CONNECTICUT
ZONING REGULATIONS
PLANNING & ZONING COMMISSION
EFFECTIVE – July 1, 2018
Welcome to Kent!
These Zoning Regulations are intended to guide land use activities in Kent in ways that will maintain and enhance community character and protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The Planning and Zoning Commission, in establishing and maintaining these Regulations, has given careful consideration to balancing the desire of individual property owners to use their property without restriction with the desire of all property owners to maintain an attractive community and protect public interests.
It is the general purpose and intent of these Regulations to foster the use and development of land in an orderly manner by both private and public interests. These Regulations provide standards and procedures by which development of property within the Town may be reviewed and modified in order to enhance the general welfare of the citizens.
These Regulations are intended to be a dynamic document, not a static document. It is anticipated that these Regulations will be regularly reviewed and updated, as necessary, to anticipate and reflect the ever changing needs of the community and to guide land use activities in Kent in ways that will continue to maintain and enhance community character and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

5100 KENT VILLAGE OVERLAY DISTRICT (KVOD)
5110 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of the Kent Village Overlay District (KVOD) is to protect and enhance the unique character and scale of the village of Kent as a small New England village in accordance with the goals set forth in the Town of Kent Plan of Conservation and Development. The KVOD regulations are intended to ensure that new development or redevelopment of land or modification of buildings within the District are consistent and compatible with the existing village character. These regulations have been adopted to establish this area as a “village district” as authorized by CGS Section 8-2j, as may be amended.
The intent of these regulations is to:
1. maintain the existing village scale by encouraging buildings that are generally compatible in size and character to the existing residential-style and commercial-style buildings that predominate the streetscape;
2. preserve the historic and significant structures within the District;
3. encourage pedestrian activity within the village center;
4. promote and retain a mix of commercial and residential uses (mixed-use) in the commercial district;
5. ensure the future cohesiveness and unity of the Kent Village District by connecting any future streets into the existing District road network;
6. discourage the widening of existing streets and encourage the width of new streets to be consistent with the existing streets in the Kent Village District; and
7. encourage vibrant and diverse residential development consistent with the traditional character of the community that fits harmoniously into the town fabric and helps reinforce the local sense of place.
For reference, a disc is available in Town Hall with a visual inventory of the Kent streetscape.

In considering an application for a Special Permit, the Commission shall evaluate the application with respect to the following factors, except that the Commission may determine that some factors may not be applicable to certain types of applications:
1. Zoning Purposes Whether the proposed use or activity is consistent with the purposes of the Regulations. 2. Environmental Protection and Conservation Whether appropriate consideration has been given to the protection, preservation, and/or enhancement of natural, scenic, historic, or unique resources including, where appropriate, the use of conservation restrictions to protect and permanently preserve natural, scenic, historic, or unique features which enhance the character and environment of the area. 3. Overall Neighborhood Compatibility Whether the proposed use will have a detrimental effect on neighboring properties or the development of the district. 4. Suitable Location For Use Whether the nature and intensity of the operations involved with the use or resulting from the proposed use and the location of the site are such that the use will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development in the district in which it is located. 5. Appropriate Improvements Whether the design elements of the proposed development (such as location, type, size and height of buildings and other structures, parking, access, landscaping, screening, lighting, signage, etc.) will be attractive and suitable in relation to the site characteristics, the style of other buildings in the immediate area, and the existing and desirable future character of the neighborhood in which the use is located.

6. Suitable Transportation Conditions Whether the streets and other rights-of-way are or will be of such size, condition and capacity (width, grade, alignment and visibility) to adequately accommodate the traffic to be generated by the particular proposed use and not create traffic problems. 7. Adequate Public Utilities and Services Whether the provisions for water supply, sewage disposal, storm water drainage, and emergency access conform to accepted engineering practices, comply with all standards of the appropriate regulatory authorities, and will not unduly burden the capacity of such facilities. 8. Long Term Viability Whether adequate provision has been made for the sustained maintenance of the proposed development (structures, streets, and other improvements). 9. Nuisance Avoidance Whether the use, configuration, design and/or hours of operation are appropriate in order to control noise, light, odors, parking visibility, unsightly appearance, erosion, water contamination and storm-water runoff on the site and in relation to the surrounding area. 10. Plan of Conservation and Development Whether the proposed use or activity is in accordance with or facilitates achievement of one or more of the goals, objectives, policies, and recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, as amended. 11. Mitigation Whether adequate provisions have been made to moderate or mitigate neighborhood impacts by limiting the intensity of use of the property (including, without limitation, such considerations as the area devoted to the use, the number of people involved in the use, the number of events or activities proposed, the hours of operation, etc.) or by modifying the location or configuration of the proposed use.

accordance with Section 3.8.6.
3.8.1. Each area reserved for such purpose shall be conveniently accessible to all lots from public ways,
and shall be so located as to serve adequately all parts of the subdivision, as approved by the
Commission. The Commission may require that the area so reserved be located or laid out so as
to be used in conjunction with similar areas of adjoining subdivisions or of probable future
subdivisions. All areas reserved for open space purposes, shall contain not less than one acre,
unless otherwise approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not require more than
15% of the gross area of the subdivision to be reserved for such open space purposes. The open
space area shall be shown and shall be noted on the Subdivision Plan as "Reserved for Open
Space Purposes".
10

purposes, with power to assess the members for all necessary costs;
b. Be binding on all future owners;
c. Be perpetual;
d. Not be affected by any change in zoning or land use designation;
e. Assure appropriate maintenance of the reserved land;
f. Permit enforcement by adjoining property owners or the Town by appropriate court action;
and
g. Provide that if maintenance, preservation or use of the reservation no longer complies with
the provisions of the document, the Town may take all necessary action to assure
compliance and assess against the association all costs incurred by the Town for such
purposes.
3.8.5. After approval by the Commission, the document shall be filed by the applicant in the Office of the
Town Clerk.
3.8.6. The Commission, solely at its option, may authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the Town or pay a
fee to the Town and transfer land to the Town in lieu of any requirement to provide open spaces.
Such payment or combination of payment and the fair market value of land transferred shall be
equal to not more than 10% of the fair market value of land to be subdivided prior to the
approval of the subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly
selected by the Commission and the applicant. A fraction of such payment, the numerator of
which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved parcels in the subdivision,
shall be made at the time of the sale of each approved parcel of land in the subdivision and
11
placed in a fund which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring
additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes. The open space
requirements of this Section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than
five parcels shall be to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first
cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision shall contain affordable housing, as defined in
section 8-39a of the General Statutes, equal to 20% or more of the total housing to be
constructed in such subdivision.

developing all lots and related improvements will result in a disturbed area of more than
one-half acre, said Control Plan shall be submitted on a lot by lot basis to the Commission for its
review and approval prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit for each lot. In addition, a note
shall be added to the map for said subdivision, and in the deed for each lot, stating that no
development shall take place on any lot until the Control Plan for said lot has been approved by
the Commission.
3.18. PASSIVE SOLAR ENERGY. Each applicant submitting a plan for subdivision shall demonstrate to the
Commission that consideration has been given in developing the plan, to using passive solar energy
techniques which would not significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer, after tax credits,
subsidies and exemptions. Such passive solar energy techniques mean site design techniques which maximize
solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide for natural ventilation during the cooling season. Such
techniques shall include, but not be limited to:
3.18.1. House orientation;
3.18.2. Street and lot layout;
3.18.3. Vegetation;

to these Subdivision Regulations.
3.20. DEFACTO SUBDIVISION. If two or more houses are constructed on a lot for which the Zoning
Regulations permit only one house, or a parcel of land is divided into three or more lots, and it seems
otherwise evident to the Commission that, in fact, a subdivision is being developed even though no
application for such subdivision has been made, the Commission may declare the parcel a subdivision and
require the developer to make application as required in these Regulations, unless the developer can
reasonably prove to the Commission that his actions do not constitute a subdivision. Failure to follow the
action of the Commission shall make the developer liable to appropriate penalties, and no further building
permits shall be granted on such parcel until the developer has complied.

SECTION 4
SUBDIVISION PLAN-PROCEDURES
4.1. PRE-APPLICATION ADVANCE DISCUSSION. Whenever a subdivision is proposed involving one or more
streets, or an appreciable number of lots or any unusual planning or design problem, the Commission
recommends, but does not require, that an advance discussion be requested by the subdivider with the
Commission prior to the filing of a Subdivision Plan application.
4.2. SUBMISSION OF PRE-APPLICATION LAYOUT. The subdivider of any proposed subdivision may submit
two copies of a pre-application subdivision layout to the Commission at least two weeks prior to the regular
Commission meeting. The subdivider shall notify all adjacent landowners that a pre-application layout has
been submitted to the Commission, and an affidavit certifying the same shall be presented to the Commission
prior to the next regular Commission meeting at which the pre-application layout is to be discussed. The
submission of a pre-application layout shall not be considered an application for Subdivision Plan approval,
and review of such layout by the Commission shall not constitute action on any subdivision application.
4.3. TENTATIVE CHARACTER OF LAYOUT. A pre-application subdivision layout submitted for advance
discussion should contain essentially the information required for a Subdivision Plan, except that bearings,
angles and curve data may be omitted, dimensions may be approximate and the layout of proposed streets and
road construction plans may be tentative and preliminary. Contours, location of waterways and drainage data
shall be sufficiently accurate to make the proposed layout clear.
4.4. LAYOUT CONTENT. A pre-application subdivision layout may be drawn in pencil to a scale of 100 feet or less
to the inch, and should contain the following information:
4.4.1. The name, location, and boundaries of the proposed subdivision;
4.4.2. The name, and address of the subdivider;
4.4.3. Names of all abutting property owners;
15
4.4.4. Date, scale, and north arrow;
4.4.5. Location of watercourses, water areas, marsh and swamp land, and wetlands;
4.4.6. Location and use of existing buildings, existing sewers, water mains, culverts, utility lines, wooded
areas, and other features that have relation to the use and development of the subdivision;
4.4.7. Location and dimensions of proposed parks, proposed lots within the limits of the subdivision;
proposed drainage lines for storm and surface water and sewage disposal systems; availability
and proposed installation of water, electricity and gas, if any; and
4.4.8. The location and dimensions of reserve strips.
4.4.9. The location dimensions and condition of any road serving the site and whether any of such roads are
donated scenic roads.
4.5. PRE-APPLICATION OPINION. A layout for pre-application discussion shall be studied by the Commission
as to whether it complies with these Regulations, and the subdivider shall be informed of the Commission's
opinion as to whether or not it does. Such opinion expressed by the Commission shall not be construed as
binding upon The Commission. This pre-application opinion is intended only to provide a guide to the
subdivider in the preparation of the Subdivision Plan.
4.6. APPLICATION AND SUBDIVISION PLAN. The subdivider of any proposed subdivision shall submit to the
Commission at a regular meeting one final record plot and six copies of a proposed Subdivision Plan. Any
such material not transmitted at a Commission meeting shall be considered submitted at the next regularly
scheduled Commission meeting. A schedule of Commission meetings is on file with the Town Clerk. The
proposed Subdivision Plan shall contain all information as required in Section 4.4, and accompanied by the
following:
4.6.1. An application, written on a form provided by the Commission and signed by the applicant or his
lawful agent;

said application;
4.6.9. If the applicant or the subdivider is not the record owner of the subject property, proof of authority
from record owner shall be submitted to the Commission;
4.6.10. A statement by the applicant's professional engineer of the estimated cost of construction of
subdivision streets, drainage, and other related improvements.
4.7. DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES. The Commission shall transmit one copy of the proposed Subdivision Plan to
each of the following for their review and comment: the Board of Selectmen, the Conservation - Inland
Wetlands Commission and the Water Pollution Control Authority.
4.8. REFERRAL TO REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY. Whenever a subdivision of land is proposed, the area
16
of which will abut or include land in two or more municipalities, one or both of which are within a region or
regions having a Regional Planning Agency or Agencies, the Commission shall, before approving the plan,
submit it to the Regional Planning Agency or agencies of the region in which it or the other municipality is
located. The Regional Planning Agency has 30 days within which to make its report. If such a report is not
submitted within 30 days after transmittal, it is presumed that the Regional Planning Agency does not
disapprove of the proposed subdivision.
4.9. PUBLIC HEARING. The Commission may hold a public hearing regarding any subdivision proposal if, in its
judgement, the specific circumstances require such action. No Resubdivision Plan shall be acted upon
without a public hearing.
4.10. COMMISSION ACTION. The Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or disapprove any
subdivision application or maps and plans submitted therewith, in all cases where no public hearing is held,
within 65 days after receipt of such application. If the Commission holds a public hearing on a given
subdivision application, the hearing shall commence within 65 days after receipt of the application and shall
be completed within 30 days after such hearing commences. All decisions shall be rendered within 65 days
after completion of the hearing. For purposes of this Section, the receipt of an application, request or appeal
shall be the day of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission, immediately following the day of
submission to the Commission or its agent of such application, request or appeal or 35 days after such
submission, whichever is sooner. Failure of the Commission to act shall be considered as an approval. In
disapproving a Subdivision Plan, the Commission shall state its reasons for so doing. Notice of the decision
of the Commission shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation within the Town within 15
days after such decision has been rendered. Such notice shall be a simple statement that such application was
approved, modified and approved or disapproved together with the date of such action.
4.11. APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLAN. After the applicant's compliance with all of the requirements,
including modifications, if needed, final approval shall be endorsed on the original Subdivision Plan by the
Chairman or Secretary of the Commission. A copy of the original plan shall also be endorsed at the same
time by the Chairman for the Commission's files.
4.12. PERFORMANCE BOND. No Subdivision Plan shall receive approval by the Commission until all
improvements have been installed or, in lieu thereof, a performance bond has been posted in accordance with
Section 6.6.
4.13. FILING OF APPROVED SUBDIVISION PLAN. Any plan for subdivision shall, upon approval, or when
taken as approved by reasons of the failure of the Commission to act, be filed or recorded by the applicant at
his expense in the Office of the Town Clerk within 90 days of the date such plan is delivered to the applicant
and any plan not so filed or recorded within the prescribed time shall become null and void, except that the
Commission may extend the time for such filing for two additional periods of 90 days and the Commission's
approval shall remain valid until the expiration of such extended time. All plans shall be delivered to the
applicant for filing or recording promptly after the time for taking an appeal from the action of the
Commission has elapsed, and in the event of an appeal, promptly upon the termination of such appeal by
dismissal, withdrawal or judgement in favor of the applicant.
4.14. REVISION AFTER SIGNATURE: VOID PLAN. No changes, modifications or revisions shall be made
in any Subdivision Plan after approval has been given by the Commission and endorsed, in writing, on the
plan. In the event that any Subdivision Plan, when recorded, contains any such changes, the plan shall be
considered null and void. The Commission shall institute proceedings to have the plan stricken from the
records of the Town Clerk.
4.15. RECORD PLOT. The Subdivision Plan shall include a record plot prepared for filing in the Office of the
Town Clerk and such other drawings and statements as prescribed in this Section, or as may be required by
the Commission. Four additional blue or black line contact prints of the record plot shall be submitted for the
use of the Commission.

19
SECTION 5
CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT
5.1. PURPOSE. To permit variation in residential developments which would not otherwise be possible; to permit
flexible site design so that development may be constructed in harmony with, and preservation of, natural
resources; and to permit residential developments which are sensitive to parcel configuration, topography,
natural resources, solar access, and the surrounding area.
5.2. LOCATION AND MINIMUM PARCEL SIZE. A Conservation Development may only be permitted by
Special Permit in accordance with Section 5.9 of the Zoning Regulations for parcels containing more than 50
acres in a Rural District subject to the following conditions in addition to conforming to the requirements of
the Subdivision Regulations.
5.3. APPLICABILITY. An applicant may apply to the Commission for Conservation Development as an alternative
to a conventional subdivision. In those cases where the subject site contains unique natural resources or
significant sensitive environmental features, the Commission may require the proposed subdivision to be
submitted under Conservation Development regulations.
5.4. OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION. A minimum of 40% of the Conservation Development area and all other
open space containing more than one acre shall be preserved as open space, preferably in one continuous
parcel. Only areas containing a minimum of one acre with a minimum dimension of 100 feet and free of any
man made impervious surfaces shall qualify for the open space requirement.
5.4.1. Such open space shall be readily accessible to all dwellings in the development by street or by
pedestrian way. It shall have adequate vehicular access for service and maintenance.
5.4.2. If such open space were determined by the Commission not to be left in its natural state, it shall be
suitably graded and landscaped and shall have adequate provisions for drainage.
5.4.3. The Commission may require that such open space be located so as to be used in conjunction with
similar adjoining areas, either existing or potential.
5.4.4. The open space area shall be noted on the plan as "Reserved for Open Space Purposes".
5.4.5. Land marked "Reserved for Open Space Purposes" on the plan shall be donated to a non-profit
conservation organization and the land shall be maintained as open space in perpetuity. The
donation of open space land to said organization shall not require the consent of adjacent
property owners.
20
5.4.6. If evidence acceptable to the Commission is not submitted confirming acceptance of the open space
by a non-profit conservation organization, as a condition of approval of the Conservation
Development by the Commission, a document acceptable to the Commission's legal counsel
shall be filed by the applicant in the office of the Town Clerk which document:
a. Shall establish an association of property owners to maintain the land reserved for open
space purposes, with power to assess the members for all necessary costs;
b. Shall be binding on all future owners;
c. Shall be perpetual;
d. Shall not be affected by any change in zoning or land use;
e. Shall assure appropriate maintenance of the reserved land;
f. May be enforced by adjoining property owners or the Town by appropriate court action;
and,
g. Shall provide that if maintenance, preservation or use of the open space no longer complies
with the provisions of the document, the Town may take all necessary action to assure
compliance and assess against the association all costs incurred by the Town for such
purposes.
5.5. MAXIMUM DENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT: A sketch layout of a conventional Subdivision Plan shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Commission for the sole purpose of establishing the maximum number of
building lots that may be permitted. Said plan, in a generalized format, shall meet the requirements of the
Town's Subdivision and Zoning Regulations as to the layout of lots and roads for single-family dwellings in
accordance with the provisions for Rural District regulations. The maximum number of building lots to be
permitted shall not exceed the number of lots shown on the sketch plan and determined by the Commission to
represent a reasonable subdivision of the land. The Commission's action in making such determination shall
not be construed as approval under the General Statutes for said concept subdivision plan or any other
subdivision plan, either in the present or future, which shall be a derivation of said concept subdivision plan.
5.6. REDUCTION IN LOT SIZES AND YARDS. The maximum reduction in lot area, yards and setbacks for
individual lots shall not exceed 50 percent of that normally required by Section 7.3 of the Zoning Regulations
and shall comply with the following:
5.6.1. Lot area: minimum 20,000 square feet; maximum 40,000 square feet.
5.6.2. Side or rear yards: minimum 15 feet.
5.6.3. Front yard setback: minimum 20 feet.
5.6.4. Building coverage: maximum 15 percent.
5.6.5. Minimum square requirement: 100 feet each side, with one side along the required front yard
setback.
5.6.6. Site perimeter setback: structures shall be setback a minimum of 150 feet from any property line on
the perimeter of the site except where such property line shall abut another Conservation
Development site or shall abut severe topography, water bodies, or other unique physical
conditions, in which case the Commission may permit a lesser setback.
5.7. ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT. The Commission may permit a Conservation Development
wherein the land and common facilities shall be under single common ownership, in which case individual
lots and yards shall not be required; however, no structure shall be within 30 feet of another structure nor
closer than 20 feet to a road. The Commission shall determine which of the other requirements and conditions
of this section shall be applicable. If a proposal under the Alternate Development Concept shall not constitute
a subdivision under the provisions of the General Statutes, said proposal shall also comply with the provisions
21
for a Special Permit in accordance with Section 5.9 of the Zoning Regulations.
5.8. WATER SUPPLY/SEWAGE DISPOSAL. All water supply and sewage disposal systems shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with procedures set forth in these Regulations, applicable State laws and local
ordinances. Documentation shall be submitted by the applicant regarding the quality and quantity of the
proposed water supply. The design and construction of the proposed water supply and sewage disposal
systems shall be subject to approval by the Town Sanitarian. Where individual on-site septic systems are not
deemed feasible, a community sewerage system may be utilized.
5.9. FIRE PONDS. Fire ponds shall be provided in accordance with Section 16.4 of the Zoning Regulations.
5.10. ROAD AND DRAINAGE STANDARDS. Roads and drainage shall be constructed to conform with the
latest Town specifications and requirements.

roof lines, sizes, facades, materials, and colors.
22
SECTION 6
STREET REQUIREMENTS
6.1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
6.1.1. The Town is not responsible for road improvements required by intensified usage due to subdivision
of any parcel of land. The Commission shall not approve any application for subdivision if it
deems any Town road inadequate to safely accommodate increased traffic engendered by a
proposed subdivision unless the subdivider, upon request, submits plans for Town road
improvement as may be required by the Commission, such plan is approved by the Board of
Selectmen and bond for such work is posted.
6.1.2. The proposed street layout of a subdivision shall maintain and conform to existing street patterns and
policies established in the plan of development and the town character study and open space
plan, or any portion therefore, especially with respect to safe intersections with existing streets
and roads.*
6.1.3 All streets in a proposed subdivision shall have free access to, or shall be a continuation of, existing
accepted public streets adjacent to the subdivision.
6.2. STREET CONSTRUCTION. All streets in a subdivision shall be graded, constructed and surfaced as shown on
the Subdivision Plan, including all bridges, culverts, catch-basins, manholes and other drainage structures. All
streets shall be constructed to a cross-section approved by the Commission. All construction and paving shall
be in accordance with specifications of these Regulations and shall be under the immediate inspection,
supervision, and approval of the Commission. No subgrades, storm or sanitary sewers, drains, culverts or
bridge work shall be covered until inspected and approved by the Commission or its authorized agent.
6.3. STREET NAMES. All proposed streets in a subdivision shall bear tentative names which shall not duplicate or
be phonetically similar to any of the existing streets in the Town. The tentative names of all proposed streets
shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
6.4. SUBDIVISION NOT ABUTTING AN ACCEPTED STREET. Since land in a proposed subdivision is not
buildable if access thereto from the Town road system is inadequate, developers are advised to make whatever
arrangements are necessary with the Board of Selectmen to assure adequate access to their proposed
subdivision before submitting such plan to the Commission.
6.5. CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PERMIT. The Connecticut Department of
Transportation requires that a permit be obtained where a proposed street or drain joins with a State Highway.
The developer is advised to obtain such permit prior to the submission of a Subdivision Plan and include a
copy of such permit with his subdivision application.
6.6. BONDING REQUIREMENTS.
6.6.1. Posting of Performance Bond.
a. As a condition of Subdivision Plan approval, the Commission may require that the
23
applicant post with the Town a performance bond to guarantee satisfactory completion of
all proposed site improvements (excluding buildings) shown on the approved Subdivision
Plan.
b. An itemized estimate of the cost of the site improvements shall be prepared by the
applicant's professional engineer, including a separate inflation factor for the estimated
construction period, and shall be submitted to the Commission's Engineer for approval.
c. The bond shall be posted with the Town for an initial period not to exceed 18 months unless
an extension of time shall be requested by the applicant and granted by the Commission.

of the bonded site improvements, the applicant may request in writing a reduction of the bond.
The Commission shall cause the site to be inspected by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, the
Commission's Engineer, and/or other appropriate Town officials to determine if the portion of
the required site improvements for which the reduction is being requested has been satisfactorily
completed in accordance with the approved Subdivision Plan. Based upon these findings, the
Commission may authorize the reduction of such bond.
6.6.3. Release of Performance Bond/Posting of Maintenance Bond. Before the release of a performance
bond, the Commission:
a. Shall require the applicant to submit "as-built" drawings in accordance with Section 6.6.9.;
and,
b. May require that the applicant post a maintenance bond to be retained for a period of two
years after vegetative cover and plantings have been installed in order to guarantee the
survival of landscaping and to ensure any other relevant improvements.
c. Shall require the applicant to provide evidence that he has made an irrevocable request to
the Board of Selectmen to accept any roads within the subdivision as Town roads. If the
Town does not accept the subject road(s) within one year from the time of the irrevocable

letter of credit from a bank chartered to conduct business in Connecticut.
6.6.5. Expiration of Subdivision Plan Approval. All site improvements in connection with an approved
Subdivision Plan shall be completed within five years after the Commission's approval of said
plan. Failure to complete all site improvements within such period shall result in automatic
expiration of the approval of such plan provided the Commission shall file on the land records of
the Town notice of such expiration and shall state such expiration on the Subdivision Plan on
file in the Office of the Town Clerk.
6.6.6. Amendments. All site improvements shall be carried out in strict compliance with the Subdivision
Plan approved by the Commission. Minor amendments to the approved Subdivision Plan may
be approved only in writing by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and/or Commission's Engineer
upon the written request of the applicant. All other amendments or modifications to the
Subdivision Plan shall require the approval of the Commission.
6.6.7. Continuance. All conditions and improvements shown on the approved Subdivision Plan shall
continue in force until completed to the Commission's satisfaction and the total bond released,
24
regardless of any change in ownership of the property.
6.6.8. Certificate of Occupancy. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued by the Building Official
until the Zoning Enforcement Officer has determined that the site improvements have been
completed in accordance with the approved Subdivision Plan.

readily when rolled or which contain organic or man-made material shall be removed and
all loose rock or boulders shall be removed or broken to a depth of one foot below the
subgrade. All holes or depressions made by the removal of unsuitable material shall be
filled and rolled uniformly with a roller weighing at least ten tons. If the surface of an
existing road is two feet or less below the proposed subgrade surface, it shall be scarified
for the full width of the roadbed. All ledge rock and boulders shall be removed to a depth
of 12 inches below the grade of the existing road. The subgrade shall be constructed the
full width of the wearing surface as indicated in Section 7.2.2.d.
b. The subbase shall consist of bank gravel. Where ledge rock is encountered, it shall be
excavated to a depth of 12 inches, and the subbase shall be at least 12 inches thick. Where

7.3.6. Centerline of any two streets entering on opposite sides of a street shall intersect at the centerline of
the intersected street at the same point, or shall be separated by at least 400 feet, measured along
the centerline.
7.3.7 Streets shall be designed and constructed to continue to the property line between adjacent properties
unless the commission determines that such extension:
a) Would require substantial blasting of rock
b) Would require cutting or filling to depths or heights of four feet or more
c) Would require or cause intrusion in, destruction of, or other harmful effects on inland
wetlands, watercourses, or other significant natural or historic resources, sites, or
features
d) Would involve street gradients of ten percent or more
e) Would create a traffic hazard*
7.4. GRADES. Grades of all streets shall not exceed 10 percent nor be less than one percent. Grades of up to 12
percent may be permitted by the Commission when unusual conditions of topography are encountered and
there is no apparent alternate layout for a street and the length of street subject to increased grade is confined
to relatively short distances. Grades shall not be greater than six percent within 50 feet of an intersection.
Maximum grade of a cul-de-sac shall not exceed three percent.
7.5. SLOPES. Where the side slope outside the shoulder exceeds a drop of one foot in four feet, guard rails of

subdivision design. A cul-de-sac shall terminate in a turnaround circle having a right-of-way not less than 150
feet in diameter with a center island at least 40 feet in diameter.* If the turnaround is proposed to be
temporary for future extension to adjoining property, it shall be so noted on the Subdivision plan and, if the
street is extended, portions of the turnaround area outside the 50 foot right-of-way of the street shall revert to
adjoining properties.
7.6.1 VILLAGE CENTER: Cul-de-sacs are not permitted in the village center. When conditions as described
in Section 7.3.7 a,b,c,d or e, favor a dead end street rather than a through street, a turnaround shall be

along any combination of intersecting deadend streets having a single collective outlet onto a
through street. No deadend street may be longer than 2,500 feet. The above limitation on the length of a
deadend street may be waived by the Commission where it is shown that the additional length of the
street will (a) further the goals for development as set forth in the Plan of Development and Town
Character Study and Open Space Plan, and (b) will result in the permanent protection of an open space
area or natural resource feature that would otherwise not be so protected.*
7.7. SIGHT DISTANCES. Wherever a street intersects with a Town or State road, a minimum sight distance of 350
feet shall be required in each direction along the major road.
7.8. CATCHBASINS. At the discretion of the Commission, catch basins may be required when the conditions or
nature of the drainage area encompassing the proposed subdivision and street system will result in excessive
runoff or create unsafe conditions.
7.9. MONUMENTS AND MARKERS. Stone or reinforced concrete monuments shall be placed at all points of
curvature or tangency, at all angle points on the street lines and at one front corner of each lot. Iron pipes or
pins shall be placed at all other lot corners or angle points. The cost of and placing of such monuments, pipes
or pins shall be borne by the subdivider.
7.10. STREET SIGNS. Before any part or lot of the subdivision shall be sold or offered for sale, the entrance of the
proposed street from each public street with which it connects shall be posted with a sign at least two feet by
six inches legibly containing only the name of the street. The cost of and the placing of such signs shall be
borne by the subdivider.

drainage. All such drainage systems shall be designed by a professional engineer and, upon completion, a
professional engineer shall certify that the drainage as built is in compliance with the approved design.
7.12.1. Downstream drainage effect of each proposed subdivision outside the area of the subdivision shall
also be calculated by a professional engineer. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the Commission shall not approve the subdivision until the subdivider has made
provision for the improvement of such potential condition as the Commission deems reasonable.
7.12.2. Where a subdivision of land proposes building lots on an existing approved road, or where the tract
of land to be subdivided presently receives storm water drainage from an existing road or
watercourse, it will be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide an approved storm
drainage system suitable to give the existing road and adjacent lots of the proposed subdivision
proper drainage.

rubbish or waste materials resulting from his operations. All ditches shall be filled and all unpaved areas
within the street lines shall be graded, covered with suitable topsoil or loam, rolled, fertilized (environmentally
benign) and seeded.
The subdivider shall submit to the Commission, a plan providing the upkeep, maintenance and repair of the
street so long as it remains a private street, including the prevention of water runoff, excessive ice formation
or any other condition which would create a hazard to vehicular or pedestrian traffic on any abutting Town
road.
SECTION 8
SANITARY REQUIREMENTS AND LOT LAYOUT
8.1. GENERAL. All lots in a subdivision shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Zoning Regulations. In
30
addition, where a lot is not to be served by public water supply and/or sanitary sewers, such lot shall have
sufficient area and suitable dimensions to provide ample space to accommodate a private water supply and/or
accommodate the proper layout and installation of a private sewage disposal system, both as needed by the
intended use of the lot and both in accordance with good engineering practice and the applicable requirements
and recommendations of the State Department of Health and the Town Sanitarian.
8.2. RESERVE LEACHING FIELD. Leaching systems for the disposal of the septic tank effluent shall be laid out
in such a manner that a reserve land area of suitable characteristics shall be provided equivalent in area to that
occupied by the primary leaching system, for the purpose of enlargement or replacement of the primary
leaching system in the event of failure, except that no such reserve area shall be required in connection with
replacement or repair of existing leaching systems.
8.3. SEEPAGE TESTS. At least one observation pit per each proposed primary and reserve leaching system, or more
if required by the Commission, shall be dug to a depth of at least seven feet within the area of the proposed
leaching systems. All seepage tests shall be made in accordance with the recommendations of the State
Department of Health.
8.4. PERCOLATION TESTS. Two percolation tests shall be taken on each lot, one at the location of the proposed
leaching field and one at the location of the future reserve leaching field of the sanitary waste disposal system.
Percolation tests shall not be taken in "fill" material until at least one year has elapsed from the date of the
deposition of the "fill" material. The location of the percolation tests, the "depth to bedrock" data and the
groundwater level shall be indicated on the Subdivision Plan. A statement showing the results of such tests,
certified by a professional engineer shall be submitted with the Subdivision Plan application. The Town
Sanitarian shall inspect and witness each percolation test and observation pit seepage test and shall report the
results to the Commission.
8.5. SANITARY REPORT. Where individual on-site sewage systems are proposed, the Subdivision Plan shall be
accompanied by a Sanitary Report in triplicate prepared by a professional engineer and submitted for approval
to the Town Sanitarian. The report shall demonstrate the feasibility of the ground for sub-surface disposal of
septic tank effluent. The report shall deal with the entire tract discussing the following points:
8.5.1. General nature and development of surrounding area shown on map;
8.5.2. Topography and natural drainage pattern;
8.5.3. Sub-surface soil absorption characteristics, ground water level conditions, ledgerock, and general
nature of soil;

100 year frequency storm;
8.5.6. General description of the type of development contemplated, noting type of dwelling units and
structures, number of families per structure and number of bedrooms per dwelling unit;
8.5.7. Based on extensive sub-surface investigations and tests, the report shall describe the suitability of
soil for the absorption of septic tank effluent, area required for leaching systems, percolation
tests results, observation pits, geological data, seepage tests results, and technical standards
required.
8.5.8. The Sanitary Report shall be a comprehensive and documented study, complying with all of the
above requirements. It shall contain a statement by the professional engineer regarding the
suitability of the area for the installation of sanitary sewage disposal system(s) and compliance
with all requirements of these Regulations, the State Sanitary Code and the accepted standards
of the State Department of Environmental Protection.
8.6. SANITARIAN REPORT REQUIREMENT WAIVED. The requirement that the Town Sanitarian's report
accompany the application is automatically waived in those situations where regrading of the leach field area
is proposed. The Commission shall require a submission of the Town Sanitarian's report after the regrading
31
has been accomplished and the percolation tests taken.
8.7. WATER BODIES. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so
drawn as to allocate the ownership of the water body among one or more adjacent lots. The Commission may
approve an alternate plan whereby the ownership or any responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body
is so placed that it will not become a Town responsibility.

to or above base flood elevation.
F. Nonresidential construction
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including the basement, elevated to the level of the base flood
elevation, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
1. Be flood proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water.
2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy; and
3. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official a set forth in Article III, Section 1.
4. In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but
before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted
which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any
point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is
considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
G. Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article II are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
1. All encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, unless certification
(with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer
is provided demonstrating that encroachment shall not result in any
(0.00) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
2. If Section g(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reductions
provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE V: VARIANCES
Section 1: The Kent Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and request
for variances from the requirements of this regulation and may, in appropriate cases, vary
the application of this regulation or the regulation promulgated hereunder, in harmony
with their general purpose and intent, where owing conditions especially affecting such
parcels, a literal enforcement of this regulation would result in exceptional difficulty or
unusual hardship, so that substantial justice will be done and the public safety and
welfare served, and the Kent Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is a error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Kent Planning and Zoning Commission in the enforcement or administration of this
regulation.
Section 2:
A. In considering such appeal, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all
factors it determines relevant, including but not limited to:
(1) the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
(2) the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) the susceptibility of the proposed construction to flood damage;
(4) the importance of the services by the proposed construction to the
community;
(5) the necessity for a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6) the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are
not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program of that area;
(9) the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(10)the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(11)the cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting
of the variance as it deems appropriate and shall, prior to granting a
variance, make determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expenses.
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain the records of all appeal
action including technical information and report of variances to the
Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
D. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historical Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedure
set forth in the remainder of this section. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if any increase in flood level during the
base flood discharge would result.
E. Where an application is granted a variance allowing a floor elevation
below base flood elevation, that applicant shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Section 3: This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any easements or
other laws, and whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. If any
section, subsection, provision, portion, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of these
regulations should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not
affect the remaining portions of these regulations, which shall remain in full force and
effect; and to this end the provisions of these regulations are hereby declared to be
severable.
Section 4: In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions shall be
considered as minimum requirements and shall be construed so as to preserve and
maintain the purpose and intent thereof.
Section 5: The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by manmade or natural causes. This regulation does not imply that land
outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of
the Town of Kent or the Commission or any officer or employee thereof.
ARTICLE VI: APPEALS
If an applicant or an aggrieved party desires to appeal an action, requirement,
determination or decision of the commission such party may (A) File an appeal with the
Zoning Board of Appeals or (B) File and appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to Section
8-8 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Adopted by the Kent Planning and Zoning Commission: November 8, 2001
