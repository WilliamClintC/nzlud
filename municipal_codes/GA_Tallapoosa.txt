PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Tallapoosa, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2005 Code, as supplemented through December 2018, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2005 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Amy Norton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Polly Smith, City Clerk, and Patrick Clarey, Planning Coordinator, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-24. - Code of ethics. 
All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. (Georgia Constitution, article 1, section 11, paragraph 1.) 
(1)  Division A. The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use a public office in order to improve his own private standing. The principal policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are: 
a.  The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. 
b.  The constitutional laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Tallapoosa should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct. 
c.  The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others. 
d.  Elected officials should exercise sound judgement and apply ethical principles in making decision that in any manner reflect upon their elected office. 
e.  All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality. 
(2)  Division B. It is the intent of this code of ethics that the mayor and/or a member of the city council shall not knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties or which would tend to impair his judgment or actions in the performance of his official duties. Furthermore, mayor and members of the council should avoid any action which might result in, or create the appearance of, the following: 
a.  Using public office for private gain. 
b.  Impeding city efficiency or economy. 
c.  Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the city. 
(3)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Benefit means: 
1.  Anything, regardless of its monetary value, perceived or intended, by either the one who offers it or the one to whom it is offered, to be sufficient in value to influence a member of the mayor and council in the performance or non-performance of an official action; or 
2.  Anything, regardless of its monetary value, which, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence a member of the mayor and council in the performance or non-performance of an official action. 
Employee means any person who is employed in a position covered by the position classification plan of the city; and any person who is employed part-time by any operating department of the city; and any person who is employed through a contractual agreement with the city. 
Government or city means the City of Tallapoosa, Georgia. 
Immediate family means spouse, child, parent or sibling of an elected city official. 
Interest means any direct or indirect financial gain accruing to a member of the mayor and council as a result of a contract or transaction that is, or may be, the subject of an official act or action by, or with, the city.

Mayor and council means any person who is an elected official, including any person who has been elected but whose term of office has not started.

(14)  Disclosure. A member of the mayor and council shall disclose the nature of any interest or benefit he has at the time such matter is presented to the mayor and council for discussion and/or action.

Following any disclosure made pursuant to this code of ethics, the member shall not participate in any ex-parte communications with other members regarding the matter at hand. 
(15)  Deliberation and vote prohibited. No member of the mayor and council shall participate in the discussion, debate, deliberation or vote, or otherwise take part in the decision-making process on any agenda item, any official act or action in which he has a conflict of interest.

b.  Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the ethics committee shall: 
1.  Review it to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary action or is to be considered for further investigation. 
2.  Be empowered to dismiss those complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or which fail to state fact sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the mayor and the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such a complaint by the ethics committee shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in equity against the respondents government servant.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Moral character. 
(1)  Good moral character means the propensity of the person to serve the public in the licensed area in a fair, honest and open manner. 
(2)  A judgment of guilt in a criminal prosecution or a judgment in a civil action shall not be used in and of itself as proof of a person's lack of good moral character. It may be used as evidence in the determination and when so used the person shall be notified and shall be permitted to rebut the evidence by showing that: 
a.  At the current time he has the ability to, and is likely to, serve the public in a fair, honest and open manner; and 
b.  He is rehabilitated, or that the substance of the former offense is not reasonably related to the occupation or profession for which he seeks a business license or business permit. 
(3)  The following criminal records shall not be used, examined, or requested by the city in a determination of good moral character when used as a requirement to obtain a business license or business permit: 
a.  Records of an arrest not followed by a conviction.

c.  Records of an arrest or conviction for a misdemeanor or a felony unrelated to the person's likelihood to serve the public in a fair, honest, and open manner.

The failure to make such request and verification in any case where the person to whom the alcoholic beverage is sold or otherwise furnished is less than 21 years of age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the person selling or otherwise furnishing such alcoholic beverage did so knowingly. 
(i)  If any retailer or retail consumption dealer, or any person acting on behalf of such retailer or retail consumption dealer, who upon requesting proper identification from a person attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages from such retailer or retail consumption dealer pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, is tendered a driver license which indicates that such driver license is falsified, or is not the driver license of the person presenting it, or that such person is under the age of 21 years, the person to whom the license is tendered shall be authorized to either write down the name, address, and license number or seize and retain such driver license and in either event shall immediately thereafter summon a law enforcement officer who shall be authorized to seize the license either at the scene or at such time as the license can be located.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 10-19. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition because several court decisions have held that to do so would unlawfully cause to vanish what the courts have declared to be a constitutionally protected form of expression. As to adult erotic dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

It is found and declared that where there is in existence a condition or use of real estate which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation, such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the city and a public necessity exists for the cessation of such use which renders the adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation. Whenever the licensing officer or his designee finds that there exist in the city dwellings, buildings, or structures where conditions exist rendering such dwellings, buildings, or structures unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of the city, power is conferred upon the city to exercise its police power to close the aforesaid dwellings, buildings, or structures in the manner provided in this Code and under O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.

(d)  If the licensing officer investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the licensing officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause a summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference, identify the owner and parties in interest, state with particularity the factual basis for the action, and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the municipal court as pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(g)  If the licensing officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(c)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering the lien authorized by this division unless such costs are waived by resolution of the city council. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund to pay the cost of administering the lien.

The mayor and city council does hereby designate the areas described in exhibit A attached to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and incorporated herein as section 36-9 as enterprise zones to be known as the "North Tallapoosa Enterprise Zone" and the "Tallapoosa Interstate Regional Business Activity Enterprise Zone." 
(Ord. No. 01279, exh. 2013-A(95-2), 4-13-2013)

Sec. 36-6. - Specific authorization to negotiate; liaison with state agencies, on behalf of the mayor and city council.

(Ord. No. 01279, exh. 2013-A(95-6), 4-13-2013)  
Sec. 36-7. - Authorization to administer enterprise zone. 
The mayor and city council has the power to administer, require, and enforce compliance with the provisions of this chapter and such administrative rules or regulations adopted hereinafter by way of resolution or as contained in section 36-10, including, but not limited to, reports and data information from businesses within the enterprise zone to verify compliance with this chapter and state law. 
(Ord. No. 01279, exh. 2013-A(95-7), 4-13-2013)  
Sec. 36-8. - Authorization to enter into a contractual relationship regarding specific available incentives in the enterprise zones, and remedies for failure to comply with contract. 
(a)  A qualifying business shall consent to enter into a contractual agreement that outlines the incentives offered to the business and a guideline for the recapture, revocation, or reimbursement of incentive values should the terms of the contract be violated by the target business. 
(b)  Evaluation of criteria designated in the state law for the city's enterprise zones: North Tallapoosa Enterprise Zone and the Tallapoosa Interstate Regional Business Activity Enterprise Zone. 
(1)  Enterprise zone 1: North Tallapoosa Enterprise Zone. 
a.  Pervasive poverty: 
1.  Poverty rates for this proposed enterprise zone are shown in the following Census tract data (2010 Census information): 
131439804005: Poverty rate is 28.1 percent. 
2.  Abutting 131439804005 are the following tracts: 
131439802004: Poverty rate is 5.1 percent. 
131439803004: Poverty rate is 6.5 percent. 
b.  General distress. Evidence of general distress: 
1.  High rate of vacancy in existing store fronts. 
2.  Poor, deferred maintenance on many existing structures and parking lots throughout the enterprise zone. 
3.  Underutilization of valuable land. 
c.  Underdevelopment: 
1.  The high rate of vacancy, despite the availability of utilizable retail store fronts. 
2.  The high rate of unused, vacant land throughout the zone. 
3.  Building permit issuance for residential development in the zone has been non-existent the last five years. 
4.  Commercial/industrial permits in the zone have been severely decreased in the last five years. 
(2)  Enterprise zone 2: The Tallapoosa Interstate Regional Business Activity Enterprise Zone. 
a.  Pervasive poverty: 
1.  Poverty rates for this proposed enterprise zone are shown in the following Census tract data: 
131439804005: Poverty rate is 28.1 percent. 
b.  General distress: 
1.  The area surrounding Exit 5 off of I-20 has a number of abandoned and dilapidated structures which are preventing proper development of the interchange. 
2.  The current design of the GA 100 and the Exit 5 interchange is problematic as it restricts traffic flow, currently as well as future development. GA 100 throughout the interchange area needs to include two lanes in each direction and a dedicated turning lane for each on ramp, east and west, providing access for I-20. This would allow long-term successful, intensive development around the interchange without creating undesirable congestion. This intensive development would provide a large quantity of jobs for the people in the enterprise zone district and surrounding region, especially for people living in Census Tract 104. 
3.  Hundreds of acres of land surrounding this interchange lie undeveloped and exceptionally underutilized. 
4.  Poor general condition of the area. 
c.  Underdevelopment. Over the last five years, the area surrounding Exit 5 has seen a severe reduction and elimination of development, despite being in close proximity to almost 40,000 cars travelling by daily. The utter lack of building permit issuance that last five years, and the preponderance of undeveloped land, is excellent evidence of the need for development incentives. 
(c)  Building permit issuance for both of the proposed enterprise zones, in comparison to building permit issuance for the remainder of the city indicates that there is a substantial decrease in development, improvement and upkeep in the enterprise zones as compared to the remainder of the city. 
(d)  From 2008 through 2012, building permits issued within the enterprise zones, which encompass a large geographical area of the city and almost the entire retail and manufacturing areas of the city's incorporated area, were substantially lower than the remainder of the city. Permits issued over this time period within the proposed enterprise zones number 60 permits; permits issued throughout the remainder of the city numbered 94. This data indicates economic activity within the enterprise zones is 36 percent less than the economic activity throughout the rest of the city, and, considering the large undeveloped tracks, and the exceptionally high vacancy rate of existing buildings, that the geographical area proposed for designation as an enterprise zone is experiencing substantial underdevelopment. The state law requires that development activity in the nominated area be at least 20 percent lower than other areas within the local government's jurisdiction. This building permit data provides adequate evidence that this criteria has been met.

(Ord. No. 01279, exh. 2013-A(exh. A), 4-13-2013)  
Sec. 36-10. - Enterprise zone administrative policies. 
(a)  Incentives and city responsibility. The incentives outlined in this chapter will be administered by the city. The city will have the responsibility to process applications, convene a preliminary review committee as applications are received, confer with the county, and prepare final documents for mayor and council approval. The city will keep the state department of community affairs informed of enterprise zone designation and will maintain annual employment records to be filed with the department by qualifying companies by April 1 of each year. Additionally, the city will coordinate all marketing and communications regarding the enterprise zone. 
(b)  Description of the incentives and qualifying businesses. The city and the county, in agreeing to create the enterprise zones shown in section 36-9, agree to abate ad valorem property tax for qualifying businesses for ten years as outlined in this chapter and in accordance with the definitions of qualifying business as set forth in the State of Georgia Enterprise Zone Employment Act of 1997 as follows: 
(1)  The term "business enterprise" means any business which is engaged primarily in retail, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, processing, telecommunications, tourism, research and development, new residential construction, and residential rehabilitation. 
(2)  The term "service enterprise" means an entity which is engaged primarily in finance, insurance and real estate listed under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes 60 through 67, according to the 1987 edition of the Federal Office of Management and Budget Standard Industrial Classification Manual. 
a.  A qualifying business or service enterprise which increases employment by five or more new full-time equivalents in an area designated as an enterprise zone and which provided additional economic stimulus in such zone. Whenever possible, ten percent of new employees shall be low-income or moderate-income individuals. Such qualifying business or service enterprise may be new, an expansion or reinvestment of an existing qualifying business or service enterprise, or a successor to such qualifying business or service business. 
b.  Any qualifying business or service business enterprise which employs at least 5,000 persons and which creates ten or more new full-time job equivalents that did not exist prior to July 1, 1997, and which provided additional economic stimulus in such zone. 
c.  Any business receiving tax abatements according to the schedule outlined above must maintain a minimum of five new full-time job equivalents to maintain eligibility for the tax exemption. A form for reporting annual employment must be filed with the city, for its review and records. 
d.  Any project that consists of the rehabilitation of an existing structure that results in the value of the improvement exceeding the value of the land by a ratio of 5:1 is eligible for the incentives offered whether or not the project is carried out by a qualifying business or service enterprise. 
(c)  Additional considerations. The Enterprise Zone Employment Act of 1997 (O.C.G.A. § 36-88-4(b)) empowers the local governing body to make a case-by-case determination of the eligibility of each business for enterprise zone tax abatements and other incentives. Among the considerations may be the following: 
(1)  The value of the business to the economic health and well-being of the city and the county and its citizens. 
(2)  Capital investment or reinvestment by the business equal to or greater than the amount of ad valorem tax abated over the first five years of the tax incentive. 
(3)  Consideration for meeting some or all of the following criteria: 
a.  Locating in a vacant building. 
b.  Demolishing a pre-existing or abandoned structure. (Note: Does not apply to historical structures.) 
c.  Assembling four or more tracts of land for one project. 
d.  Creating jobs above the state threshold. 
e.  Creating jobs for residents of the enterprise zone and surrounding area. 
f.  Incorporating aesthetic enhancements (i.e., landscaping, type of facade material used, exclusion of billboards).

Sec. 42-19. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Junk vehicle means a vehicle that is in an obvious inoperable condition (including those whose tires have been removed for more than 72 continuous hours, but are otherwise operational) or has no license plate or does not have a current state registration sticker affixed, or is not currently insured with the minimum state liability automobile insurance. Automobile liability insurance shall be required for all vehicles within the city, unless they have been "junked" and are currently stored in a licensed junkyard. 
Nuisance means anything which causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another, provided that the hurt, inconvenience, or damage complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but rather such as would affect an ordinary reasonable person; and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. 
Nuisance per se means an act, occupation, or structure which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings. 
Private nuisance means a nuisance limited in its injurious effects to one of a few individuals. 
Public nuisance means a nuisance which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals.

(a)  It is found and declared that there is the existence of property or occupancy of dwellings or other buildings or structures which are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business occupancy or use and which are not in compliance with the general nuisance law, applicable state minimum standard codes as adopted by ordinance or operation of law or any optional building, fire, life safety, or other codes relative to the safe use of real property and real property improvements adopted by ordinance in the city, and which constitute a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the city, and that a public necessity exists for the clearing of the property to bring such property into compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances, and the repair, closing, or demolition of such dwellings, buildings, or structures. 
(1)  It is found and declared that, where there is in existence a condition or use of real estate which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation, such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the city and a public necessity exists for the repair of such condition or the cessation of such use which renders the adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation. 
(2)  Whenever the chief of police or his designee finds that there exists in the city property not in compliance with general nuisance law, and not in compliance with applicable codes, dwellings, buildings, or structures which are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use due to dilapidation and not in compliance with applicable codes, which have defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities, or which lack adequate ventilation, light or sanitation facilities, or where other conditions exist rendering such property, dwellings, buildings, or structures unsafe unsanitary or dangerous or detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of the city, or vacant, dilapidated dwellings, buildings, or structures in which drug crimes are being committed, power is conferred upon the city to exercise its police power to bring the property into full compliance with applicable codes and ordinances in the manner provided in this Code and under O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.

Sec. 42-50. - Grass and weeds. 
(a)  Prohibited conditions. For the purpose of preventing the spread of diseases and the breeding of mosquitoes and other insects, and for the protection of the health of the citizens and residents of the city, it shall be unlawful for any owner and/or tenant in possession of any land to allow weeds, grass or other vegetation (except vegetation commonly classed as growing crops, trees, or ornamental or other shrubbery or nursery plants) to grow on such land at any time above the average height of six inches. Upon the weeds, grass, or other vegetation covered by this section reaching that average height, the owner and/or tenant in possession shall be required to cut the weeds, grass or other vegetation at his own expense. 
(b)  Failure to comply. Any owner and/or tenant failing or refusing to comply with this section after three days' notice from the chief of police or any police officer designated by him shall be subject to the nuisance abatement procedures of this article. 
(c)  Exemptions. Exemptions are provided on an automatic and permitted basis. 
(1)  Automatic exemptions. Automatic exemptions to this section shall be issued, and a comprehensive list maintained, by the department of planning, under the following conditions. Exemptions are perpetual unless the property owner or tenant in possession fails to maintain the city right-of-way if necessary or begins to develop the property. If the automatic designation is lost, then a permitted exemption must be obtained or the entire property must be maintained in accordance with this section: 
a.  All property zoned agriculture and maintained/operated for that purpose by the property owner or tenant in possession, provided that the owner maintains the city right-of-way abutting his land which is adjacent to city streets in accordance with this section. 
b.  All property over 1.1 acres of land and zoned either single-family residential and multifamily residential, provided that such parcels are completely surrounded by other undeveloped parcels, professional and institutional (P and I), all commercial, and all manufacturing zoning classes which are vacant and in a current state of being overgrown (trees and natural vegetation having created a visual screen to the interior of the property), provided that the owner maintains the city right-of-way abutting his land which is adjacent to city streets in accordance with this section. 
c.  All property over 2.0 acres of land in any zoning classification which is vacant and in a current state of being overgrown (trees and natural vegetation having created a visual screen to the interior of the property). 
d.  All property under or over 1.1 acres of land which does not have a public street abutting any of its perimeter. This category, as applied to specific parcels, is subject to change in the future as roads are installed over old city rights-of-way. 
e.  Developed property, regardless of acreage, which when constructed or as currently in existence has been developed such that tree removal was avoided, provided that the owner maintains the city right-of-way abutting his land which is adjacent to city streets in accordance with this section. 
(2)  Permitted exemptions. A permit shall be issued by the planning coordinator or the city manager or his designee. The permit shall have an annual fee of $25.00. The initial permit shall expire that upcoming December, and must be renewed annually prior to March 31, or a renewal fee of $25.00, in addition to the annual permit fee, shall be charged if renewed within the following two years after expiration, expiring thenceforth every December. To have a permit issued, the applicant must submit a plat of the applicable property and accompanying deed. The plat must be completed by a registered surveyor. The plat cannot alter the property from that which is described in the deed. The plat shall be applicable only to obtaining the permitted exemption, and shall not be utilized to comply with chapter 90, pertaining to subdivisions, unless the plat fully complies with the stipulations of chapter 90. The plat will display all property lines, names of adjacent property owners, abutting public rights-of-way, improvements and appurtenances added/made to the lot, and any and all easements, and indicate fairly precisely where the area which needs to be exempt lies. Failure to maintain the city right-of-way shall result in the loss of exemption status and require the property owner to comply with all aspects of this section. The following specific conditions must be present for a permit to be issued (under any one of these conditions): 
a.  All vacant, currently undeveloped property lying within any residentially (single-family, multifamily) classified zoning district in excess of 1.1 acres and which is in a current state of being overgrown (trees and natural vegetation having created a visual screen to the interior of the property), provided that the owner maintains the city right-of-way abutting his land which is adjacent to city streets in accordance with this section. 
b.  All vacant, currently undeveloped property lying within any residentially (single-family, multifamily) classified zoning district with less than 1.1 acres and which has undeveloped property abutting the specified parcel on all sides and which is in a current state of being overgrown (trees and natural vegetation having created a visual screen to the interior of the property), provided that the owner maintains the city right-of-way abutting his land which is adjacent to city streets in accordance with this section. 
c.  Automatic exemptions which were lost due to the failure to maintain city right-of-way. The property owner must place the city right-of-way into compliance with this section, and maintain the right-of-way in accordance with this section without city intervention, for the permitted exemption to continue. Failure to maintain the city right-of-way abutting his property which is adjacent to city streets shall result in the loss of exemption status and require the property owner to comply with all aspects of this section.

Citizens who have determined that a vehicle that they are the owner of, and which is in a bad state of repair or condition (such as an antique car), and needs to be rehabilitated and repaired, may, provided they comply with all aspects of this subsection, submit an application to the department of planning, upon a form so dedicated for this purpose and provided to the applicant by the department of planning. This form shall be known as a certificate of automotive rehabilitation. It shall be completed by the property owner and the owner of the vehicle to be rehabilitated, and shall be signed by both if the owners are different. The property owner/vehicle owner shall have two years from the date of issuance of the certificate to complete any and all repairs/renovations to the vehicle, which in a residential district is restricted to passenger cars, vans and pickup trucks (large commercial vehicles are prohibited from being stored/repaired/rehabilitated in residentially zoned land districts). No more than three vehicles may be listed on this certificate per property owner and per individual parcel. The certificate shall be issued and kept on file and a database of all such issued certificates maintained by the department of planning. The certificate shall be issued only if all the following requirements have been fulfilled: 
(1)  Vehicles must be properly registered with the state and have a license plate affixed to the vehicle, and the license plate must contain a current registration sticker. 
(2)  Vehicles must be currently and perpetually insured to standard state minimums for motor vehicle liability insurance. 
(3)  Vehicles must be stored within a completely enclosed building or under a carport or stored on the driveway of the vehicle's owner. If it is to be stored in the driveway, the vehicle must not be placed in the city right-of-way portion of the driveway. 
(4)  The rehabilitation of the automobile must take place in a workmanlike manner. Progress must be continual. A schedule of accomplishments, staged at either a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis, shall be required. Failure to maintain this schedule of repair shall constitute a basis for revocation of the certificate. The certificate recipient shall be notified by mail that the certificate is to be revoked within 30 days. If the certificate recipient feels this revocation notice has been incorrectly sent, he may appeal to the mayor and city council for relief. If the certificate is revoked, then the vehicle owner shall be subject to the remaining elements of this section. 
(5)  A photograph of the vehicle listed on the certificate must be provided at the time of submitting the application. 
(6)  There is no fee associated with this certificate. However, the mayor and city council reserve the right to institute and amend a fee schedule for this certificate in the future, and to do so by resolution. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of the chief of police or designee to notify, in writing, the owner or occupant of any premises upon which junk is permitted to accumulate in violation of this section that such material must be removed within ten days from the date of the notice. Any owner or resident and/or tenant failing or refusing to comply with this section shall be subject to the nuisance abatement procedure of this article. 
(c)  Upon the failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner or occupant so notified to remove such junk within the designated time period, the city manager is authorized and empowered to arrange for the removal of such material by the city or by a private individual or firm through contract with the city. 
(d)  The actual cost of such junk removal shall be assessed against the property owner from whose premises the junk is removed, and if the bill for such charges remains unpaid for 30 days after it has been rendered, the charges shall become a lien upon the premises enforceable in the same manner as provided for the collection of unpaid taxes.

ARTICLE IV. - WETLAND PROTECTION 
 
Sec. 42-140. - Definitions. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city, as indicated on the National Wetlands Map. 
Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Soil Conservation Service or any successor office. 
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 42-143(b)(7). 
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and shown on the generalized wetland map. 
(b)  Where other terms or words require definition, refer to the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Manual or call the district Corps office in Savannah, at 1-800-448-2402.

Cross reference— Definitions, generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 42-141. - Findings; purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
(2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
(3)  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
(Code 2005, § 42-162; Ord. No. 01214, § 1, 3-12-2001)  
Sec. 42-142. - Wetland protection district. 
The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(Code 2005, § 42-163; Ord. No. 01214, § 2, 3-12-2001)  
Sec. 42-143. - Development permit; permissible uses; site plan. 
(a)  Permit or letter of permission required. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the building inspector using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
(b)  Permissible uses; temporary emergency permit. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided in this article. 
(1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual section 404 permit. 
(2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
(3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
(4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
(7)  A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons: 
a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city or its designee and, provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
b.  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use. 
d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
(c)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of not less than one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
(1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, and cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross sectional drawings. 
(2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
(3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 100 feet. 
(4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
(5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet, and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
(6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
(7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
(d)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of the site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city or its designee may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Subdivision design options in wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
(1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The city or its designee may allow a reduction in lot size, provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The city or its designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
(2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the city or its designee will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
(f)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to a maximum of $100.00 may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the city or its designee. 
(g)  Enforcement authority. The building inspector is hereby established as the administrator of this article. 
(h)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the building inspector and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon determination by the building inspector that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the building inspector. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the city or its designee. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. 
(i)  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the building inspector may be appealed to the city planning commission. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision rendered by the building inspector. A public hearing shall be held for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the city planning commission may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as discussed in section 42-146. 
(j)  Duration of permit validity. 
(1)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
(2)  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire 12 months after the date that work ceased. 
(3)  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the building inspector.

Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation program with the government or a nonprofit organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains. 
(Code 2005, § 42-169; Ord. No. 01214, § 8, 3-12-2001)  
Sec. 42-149. - Source material for preparation of generalized wetland maps. 
Source material for preparation of generalized wetland maps is as follows: 
(1)  Available map resources. 
a.  National Wetlands Inventory Maps (NWI). 
1.  NWI maps are the most commonly used maps. Most of these maps are at scales of 1:24,000 and correspond to United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps. The minimum area mapped is usually one to three acres. Small wetlands and very narrow wetlands in river corridors may be missed. 
2.  These maps were developed from interpretations of available aerial photographs; therefore, mapped boundaries of wetlands do not reflect jurisdictional boundaries (as would be determined if the federal delineation manual were used on the ground). 
3.  Only a small portion of the maps has been "ground-truthed," but nationwide efforts to assess the accuracy of the maps have been extensive. Accuracy varies upward from about 60 percent, with most maps being at least 90 percent accurate. 
4.  The strength of these maps is the spatial resolution (often to within one acre, which is relatively good). NWI maps identify the location of wetlands and indicate wetland type using the Cowardin classification scheme. 
5.  The limitations of these maps are that wetlands that were cultivated at the time of mapping are generally not depicted and forested wetlands are poorly discriminated. In some areas, these two wetland types are a major portion of the wetlands resource. Particularly in areas of rapid growth and accelerated wetlands loss, many maps have become quickly outdated. 
6.  Maps are available through: 
(i)  National Wetlands Inventory, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Office, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. Telephone: 1-404-266-8500. 
(ii)  Earth Science Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Telephone: 1-800-USA-MAPS. 
7.  Other information, including information about wetland functions and values and options for their protection, can be obtained from the EPA Wetland Protection Hotline, Telephone: 1-800-832-7828. 
b.  County soil survey maps. 
1.  These maps range in scale from 1:15,840 to 1:31,680. Soil maps do not delineate wetlands, but rather their presence may be inferred from the occurrence of soils classified as hydric by the Soil Conservation Service. From accompanying soil interpretation record data, wetlands might cautiously be classified by type. These maps were developed by trained soil scientists who examined vertical soil profiles at regular intervals along ground transects and generalized subjectively from them to the surrounding landscape on the basis of landform, vegetation and other factors. 
2.  These maps do not specify wetland type as do the NWI maps. Most published soil surveys report the acreage of each soil series in the survey area. Soil survey maps are extensively used as a secondary data source for wetlands mapping. However, hydric soil inclusions (patches of hydric soil too small to map) are probably common in many soils mapped as non-hydric, but the extent to which this occurs is unknown. It should also be noted that some soils classified as hydric are not hydric everywhere they are mapped; marginally hydric soils indicate wetlands only in certain landscape positions. Caution should therefore be used when inferring the presence of wetlands from soils classified and mapped as hydric. 
3.  The advantage of using these maps is that they are sometimes available in areas where NWI maps are not yet available. Soil surveys might be used, with caution, to infer locations of cropped wetlands not included in NWI maps; to differentiate among some wetland functional types (alluvial seasonally flooded versus isolated seasonally flooded) when linked with the SCS SOILS database which describes the physical properties of each soil series; and to categorize hydrologic and water purification function of specific wetlands. 
4.  Limitations of these maps are numerous. Many small but cumulatively significant areas that often are wetlands (with hydric soil inclusions) are not mapped because the soil classification systems used in soil survey maps classify soils in landscape groupings. Aquatic bed and many tidal or permanently flooded wetlands are typically mapped as open water, not wetlands, on SCS maps. Areas classified as having hydric soils are not always wetlands, in part because they may have been drained (either prior to or after the survey was conducted). This can lead to overestimation of current wetlands acreage. Many drained hydric soils can retain sufficient hydric features to result in their being classified by soil mappers as hydric even after decades of continuous drainage. Conversely, not all wetlands contain soils that are classified as hydric, and this can lead to underestimation of wetlands acreage. Wetlands may be the result of recent impoundment; in such areas, it typically takes at least a decade for hydric soil features to appear. Moreover, even the soils of some wetlands with hydric characteristics that have existed for decades do not appear on the SCS hydric soils list. 
5.  Maps are available through U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service field offices (generally located in the county seat of each county). 
c.  State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) and National Soil Geographic Database (NATSGO) maps. 
1.  STATSGO maps are available at 1:250,000 scale with about 100 acres resolution. Digital coverage maps will be available by late 1993. These maps include soils on federal land. 
2.  NATSGO maps are available at 1:3,000,000 and are currently available showing the entire United States. They do not include federal land. 
3.  STATSGO maps are generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. SCS has determined the map unit composition (the groupings of soil types mapped as a single polygon or unit) by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed SCS county soil survey maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize each whole map unit. 
4.  Wetlands themselves are not delineated; rather their presence may be inferred from the presence of soils officially considered hydric. From accompanying SOILS data, which describe the physical properties of each soil series, these wetlands landscapes might cautiously be classified by function. 
5.  NATSGO maps are also generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. Map units are the polygons of SCS's Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) map. The sample points of the National Resources Inventory (NRI) are statistically aggregated within each MLRA unit. Each NRI record is keyed to the soil interpretation record (SOILS) database so that soil attributes relevant to wetlands function are available for each of the 300,000 NRI sample points. 
6.  These maps are relatively new and have not been tested extensively against wetlands field data. 
7.  Both map types are the only currently available maps from which the landscape-level water purification and flood control functions of wetlands might be inferred for all areas of the United States. 
8.  The scale/resolution of the maps is inappropriate for most planning purposes at the local level. Also, these maps cannot be used to infer the functions of an individual wetland. Inferences of wetlands functions at the landscape level would be based on hydric soils, but not all hydric soils are wetlands. In the case of the STATSGO data, the soil mapping units do not necessarily coincide with physical boundaries that are relevant to defining landscape functional units (watersheds). This could lead to some imprecision in estimates compiled on that basis. The generation and compilation of thematic maps from STATSGO and NATSGO maps requires a mainframe computer with adequate storage, advanced database management and GIS software and a skilled computer technician. 
9.  Maps are available from National Cartographic Center, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Fort Worth, Texas. 
d.  Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Swampbuster maps. 
1.  These maps are mostly at a scale of 1:12,000 or 1:20,000 and primarily cover cropland and areas closely associated with cropland. 
2.  Most maps were completed since 1987 and largely represent a one-time assessment; about five percent may be reassessed annually. 
3.  Wetland boundaries were hand drawn on recent aerial photographs. The delineations were based on an overlay of hydric soils maps; hydrophytic vegetation and presence of surface water (as visible from aerial photographs from multiple years); and, in some cases, field checking to confirm wetlands status. 
4.  These maps probably represent the most extensive, detailed and up-to-date map source for wetlands in certain areas. However, because these maps are relatively new, they are not widely used because of limited distribution. 
5.  These maps are not for sale but can be viewed at state SCS offices. 
6.  The strength of these maps is that they are a useful complement to NWI maps because they include many of the wetlands that NWI misses, specifically, cropped and very small wetlands. 
7.  The limitation of these maps is that, because wetland boundaries were drawn on aerial photographs not printed for mass distribution, the maps are difficult to access and compile and they often do not include prior converted wetlands. 
e.  FEMA flood hazard maps. 
1.  The scale varies depending on the locality and ranges from one inch equals 2,000 feet to one inch equals 200 feet. 
2.  Maps show floodplains of 100- and 500-year storm events based on analyses conducted since 1968. Floodplains were delineated from topographic maps, stream flow data, channel cross sectional measurements and aerial photographs supplemented with limited hydraulic modeling and ground-checking. 
3.  These maps are not extensively used to identify wetlands. 
4.  The strength of these maps is that they might be used to help identify dominant water sources and transport vectors for specific wetlands located near rivers. They also might be used to identify wetlands that, if they store floodwater, are likely to have greater value because they help protect downstream properties that otherwise are likely to be flooded. 
5.  Limitations are that FEMA maps are not available for all jurisdictions. The 100- and 500-year floodplains do not have any particular ecological or geomorphic significance (annual, two-year and five-year floodplains are probably more functionally important) and their correlation with wetlands or hydric soil extent or function is unknown. Their accuracy may be reduced in areas with very wide, flat floodplains and backwater flooding. Boundaries may be outdated on maps of communities that have experienced rapid development since mapping. 
6.  Maps are available through Flood Map Distribution Center, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Baltimore, Maryland. 
f.  USGS Land-Use Land Analysis maps (LUDA). 
1.  Most LUDA maps are at a scale of 1:250,000; some are at 1:100,000. The minimum map unit size for the former is generally 40 acres (ten acres for open water). 
2.  These maps are based on interpretation of aerial photographs at a scale of 1:62,500 and recognize only two types of wetlands: forested and non-forested wetlands. Additionally, each map represents only one time period, ranging from the late 1960s to the present. 
3.  These maps are seldom used in identifying wetlands. 
4.  The strengths of these maps are that they are the only source of digital wetlands data for nearly the entire United States and the only map data source that includes all landscape components, not just wetlands. This allows for better integration of wetlands data with other landscape data when interpreting the role of wetlands in the landscape. 
5.  The limitation of these maps is that wetlands are grossly underestimated, because the minimum map unit size is too coarse and also because a consistent, modern definition of wetlands was not used during the mapping. In particular, forested, cropped and aquatic bed wetlands appear to be ignored or severely underestimated. 
6.  Maps are available from Earth Science Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. 
g.  State department of natural resources (DNR) landcover maps. 
1.  These maps show 15 types of land use, including seven wetland classes, and have been produced at a scale of 1:24,000. They are not available for general distribution, but are on file at RDC offices. 
2.  Digital versions of the landcover data are available from USGS Center for Spatial Analysis Technologies, Georgia Institute of Technology Research Institute, Baker Building, Atlanta, Georgia 30332. This information is derived from automated classification of Landsat satellite imagery. As with NWI maps, they cannot be used to determine jurisdictional wetlands as regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Although a useful complement to NWI maps, they were produced at an accuracy of 85 percent and have not been thoroughly field-checked.

Sec. 42-168. - Purpose. 
(a)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city, to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city. 
(Code 2005, § 42-192; Ord. No. 01215, § I, 3-12-2001)  
Sec. 42-169. - Establishment of districts. 
(a)  The Tallapoosa River and Lake Tisinger water supply watershed districts are hereby designated and shall be comprised of the land that drains to the Tallapoosa River for the county water supply intake, and the Lake Tisinger water supply reservoir. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective Tallapoosa River for the county water supply intake, and the Lake Tisinger water supply reservoir. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map of the city. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. 
(b)  The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and the boundaries shall be identified on the water supply watershed district overlay map: 
(1)  The Tallapoosa River watershed (230.870 square miles) is a large water supply watershed. It is an intake for Haralson County Water Authority, and the city is located on the Tallapoosa River. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir. 
(2)  Lake Tisinger watershed (39.516 square miles) is a small water supply watershed. It is an intake for the City of Bowdon, Georgia, which is located on Lake Tisinger. This water supply watershed contains a reservoir that is owned by the City of Bowdon, and a portion is located within the jurisdiction of the city. The Cities of Bowdon and Tallapoosa are responsible for the protection of this reservoir. The Lake Tisinger reservoir management plan has been established to protect this water system.

Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 50-25. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
(1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
(2)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
(3)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and 
(4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before July 9, 1982. 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before July 9, 1982. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register.

The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For the purposes of this article, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the start of construction commenced on or after July 9, 1982, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after July 9, 1982. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) means, as corrected in 1988, a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
(2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
(3)  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
b.  Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means a repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city manager or his designated city official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Code 1990, § 8-4-31; Code 2005, § 50-91; Ord. No. 01163, art. 5, § A, 11-11-1991; Ord. No. 01259, art. 4, § A, 11-12-2007)  
Sec. 50-79. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 50-78(4). 
b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 50-47(2). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: 
1.  On individual lots or parcels; 
2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 50-78(5).) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3) of this section. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-25 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the 1975 ordinance, the company's occupancy and use of the streets, alleys, and public places of the city as authorized in the 1975 ordinance are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the term "distribution facilities" means poles, lines, wires, cables, conductors, insulators, transformers, appliances, equipment, connections, and other apparatus installed by or on behalf of the company (whether before or after the adoption of Ordinance No. 01272, Amending Franchise) in the streets, alleys, or public places of the city for the purpose of distributing electricity within the present and future limits of the city. Distribution facilities do not include any of the following:

(2)  In the event that the city or any other entity acting on behalf of the city requests or demands that the company relocate any distribution facilities from their then-current locations within the streets, alleys, and public places of the city in connection with a public project or improvement, then the company shall relocate, at its expense, the distribution facilities affected by such project or improvement. The company's obligations under this subsection (2) shall apply without regard to whether the company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or other property right with respect to such distribution facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid to the city under the provisions of the 1975 ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (2), the company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following: 
a.  Distribution facilities that are located on private property at the time relocation is requested or demanded; 
b.  Distribution facilities that are relocated in connection with sidewalk improvements (unless such sidewalk improvements are related to or associated with road widenings, the creation of new turn lanes, or the addition of acceleration/deceleration lanes); 
c.  Streetscape projects or other projects undertaken primarily for aesthetic purposes; or 
d.  Distribution facilities that are converted from an overhead configuration or installation to an underground configuration or installation. 
(3)  The city and the company recognize that both parties benefit from economic development within the city. Accordingly, when it is necessary to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) within the city, the city and the company shall work cooperatively to minimize costs, delays, and inconvenience to both parties while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the city and the company shall communicate in a timely fashion to coordinate projects included in the city's five-year capital improvement plan, the city's short-term work program, or the city's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the company's facilities. Such communication may include, but is not limited to: 
a.  Both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council, Inc. (or any successor organization), or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization); and 
b.  Both parties' use of the National Joint Utility Notification System (or any successor to such system mutually acceptable to both parties). 
(4)  With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the city, the city shall pay the company in advance for the company's estimated cost to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each streetscape project, the company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that the company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project begins and shall not include fuel recovery charges, non-electric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate indicates that the company will realize incremental base revenue, the company shall do one of the following, whichever results in greater cost savings to the city: 
a.  Reduce the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs by ten percent; or 
b.  Where the city has developed a bona fide marketing plan within 12 months after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the company's incremental base revenue during such 12-month period to the city or credit such amount against any future payment due from the city to the company. 
The city and the company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit calculated pursuant to subsection (4)b of this section shall not exceed the amount of the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs associated with such project.

Upon such acceptance all laws and ordinances, and all agreements between the company and the city with respect to the company's occupancy and use of the city's streets, alleys, and public places in actual conflict herewith are and the same shall thereupon stand repealed and terminated, respectively.

(Code 2005, § 70-38)  
Sec. 70-27. - Employee performance evaluation. 
(a)  Objective. The purpose of the employee performance evaluation shall be primarily to inform employees of how well they are performing their work and how they can improve their work performance.

(c)  Abandonment of job. 
(1)  An employee not on authorized leave of absence who fails to report for work for three consecutive days may be terminated from the service of the city for job abandonment in accordance with section 70-29(c)(4). 
(2)  Any employee terminated for job abandonment shall have the right of appeal to the mayor and city council in the manner set forth in section 70-30. 
(d)  Layoff or reduction in force. Any involuntary separation not related to an employee's conduct shall constitute a layoff or reduction in force. 
(1)  Reasons for layoff. Any employee may be laid off because of shortage of funds or work, abolishment of the position, material changes in the duties or organization, or related reasons beyond the employer's or the employee's control which do not reflect dissatisfaction with the service of the employee. The duties previously performed by any laid-off employee may be reassigned to other employees holding positions in appropriate classes. 
(2)  Notice to department head. Whenever the layoff of any employee shall become necessary, the mayor and city council shall notify the department head, at least 30 calendar days in advance of the intended action, of the necessity for such layoff and the reasons therefor. The department head shall thereupon furnish to the city manager the names and job titles of the employees to be laid off and the order in which such layoff shall be effected. 
(3)  Order of layoff. Should it become necessary to reduce the number of employees within a given class in any department, such employees shall be laid off on the basis of the following two factors, to be weighted equally: length of service in class and length of service with the city. If an employee believes that an error has been made in determining layoff order, he may request an administrative review by the city manager. 
(4)  Special cases. Should a department head determine that the retention of a certain employee is essential to the effective operation of the department because of the fact that such employee possesses special skills or abilities, and should the department head wish to retain such employee in preference to another with a higher rating, then the department head shall submit a written request to the city manager. Such notification shall set forth in detail the specific skills and abilities possessed by the employee and the reasons why such employee is essential to the effective operation of the department. With the approval of the mayor and city council, the individual may be retained. 
(5)  Notice to employees. Regular employees to be laid off shall be notified in writing by the city manager at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff. 
(6)  Demotions. Any regular employee scheduled to be laid off shall have the right to be demoted to a lower classification, provided that a vacancy exists and such employee is qualified to fill the position in the lower classification. 
(7)  Re-employment list. 
a.  Former employees who were separated from the city service by layoff and desire to be considered for re-employment with the city will be placed on the re-employment list. Such persons may remain on the re-employment list for a period not to exceed one year. 
b.  Former employees will be listed by seniority in terms of service as defined in subsection (d)(3) of this section, and will be offered re-employment for the first vacancy that becomes available in the same classification in which they were employed at the time of separation. All employees appointed to a position in this manner will serve the stated probationary period for that position; if the employee does not complete the probationary period, he will be separated from the city service without the right of appeal. 
c.  A person on the re-employment list may voluntarily accept a position at a lower classification level than his former position. In doing so all provisions of the re-employment rights section apply, including being removed from the re-employment list. 
d.  If a person placed on the re-employment list does not accept the first offer for re-employment in a position having the same classification as the one held at the time of separation, he will be removed from the re-employment list. Such persons will no longer have guarantee of re-employment rights when a vacancy occurs, but may be considered for re-employment on the same basis as other applicants. 
(e)  Inability to perform. If an employee suffers from a physical or mental disability which prevents him from performing the essential functions of the position, even with reasonable accommodation, the employee is subject to termination for inability to perform the job.

Termination due to an inability to perform essential functions shall be subject to an appeal pursuant to section 70-30. 
(f)  Loss of job requirements. Any employee who is unable to perform the essential functions of his job adequately because of loss of a necessary license or other necessary requirement shall be separated by layoff from employment in that position until such license or requirement is re-obtained. The license or requirement should be reacquired within a reasonable length of time or the employee will be dismissed. 
(g)  Dismissals. Dismissals shall constitute discharges or separations for just cause, and shall be governed by the provisions of section 70-29. 
(h)  Retirement. The retirement of an employee shall consist of the voluntary separation of an employee who has met the requirements of age and length of service under the laws governing any applicable pension fund of which such employee may be a member. 
(i)  Death. Separation shall be effective as of the date of the death of the employee. All compensation, including annual leave pay, due to such employee, as of the effective date of separation, shall be paid to the beneficiary of the employee, to the surviving spouse of such employee, or to the estate of such employee, as may be determined by law or by the applicable executed documents in the personnel folder of such employee.

(Code 2005, § 70-40)  
Sec. 70-29. - Disciplinary actions. 
(a)  Intent. Effective supervision and good employee relations should reduce to a minimum those instances necessitating disciplinary action. The establishment of rules and regulations and the imposition of disciplinary action for a violation thereof are not intended to restrict the rights of any employee, but are for the purpose of ensuring the rights of all and for securing cooperation and orderliness throughout the classified service. The severity of the disciplinary action imposed should be related to the gravity of the offense, the employee's record of disciplinary action, and the disciplinary action imposed in similar cases. Any disciplinary action imposed shall be for just cause. The city will not allow discrimination against any employee because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, or political affiliation. 
(b)  Conduct subject to disciplinary action. The following actions shall constitute just cause for disciplinary action, but the imposition of disciplinary action shall not be limited to the offenses set forth:

(3)  Absence without leave, or failure to report after the expiration of a leave of absence.

(12)  The violation of city ordinances, administrative regulations, departmental rules, or this article. 
(13)  The consumption, sale, or possession of alcoholic beverages and/or illegal substances while at work, or being intoxicated on the job, or being otherwise affected on the job because of the prior use of some illegal substance.

(1)  Reprimands. 
a.  Oral reprimand. An oral reprimand is a progressive disciplinary measure which may be issued for an incident, action, or behavior which does not warrant more severe disciplinary action. In the oral reprimand, the supervisor will verbally and privately explain to the employee that he is being reprimanded, describe the problem, and indicate what must be done to correct the problem. 
b.  Written reprimand. Where the incident, action, or behavior of the employee is such as not to initially warrant a more severe type of disciplinary action, a written reprimand may be issued for first or second offenses, including, but not limited to, unauthorized absence from duty (for less than three days), abuse of sick leave privileges, frequent unexcused tardiness, inattention to duty, insubordination, improper conduct, or loss or destruction of city property. Written reprimands shall be issued by the department head to the affected employee, and a copy of the written reprimand shall be forwarded to the city manager and filed in the personnel folder of such employee. 
(2)  Suspension. 
a.  A department head may suspend without pay any employee under his supervision for a period of not less than one and not more than ten working days. 
b.  A written statement specifically setting forth the reasons for such action and the length of time of such suspension shall be furnished by the department head to the affected employee, and a copy of such statement shall be sent to the city manager and filed in the personnel folder of such employee within one working day of the effective date of the action. 
c.  An employee may be suspended for a period longer than ten working days upon the express approval of the city manager. A written statement shall be furnished by the city manager to the affected employee within one working day of his decision, advising the employee of the length of the suspension. 
d.  When an employee has been accused of serious misconduct or criminal behavior, the employee may be suspended with pay for a period of five days, during which the city manager will conduct an investigation to determine whether the pending charges will affect the employee's job performance or whether the conduct which resulted in the arrest is the basis for disciplinary action. Where the city manager determines that an employee's return to work would not be in the best interest of the city, the employee will be given notice of his proposed indefinite suspension without pay, including the reasons for the suspension, and the employee will be given an opportunity to respond to the city manager concerning those reasons. After the employee has had an opportunity to respond, the city manager will issue a decision on the indefinite suspension. 
(3)  Demotion. 
a.  For just cause, a department head may reduce the salary of a regular employee within the range provided in the pay plan or demote the employee to a lower-graded position. The department head shall take such action after consultation with the city manager. 
b.  A written statement specifically setting forth the reasons for any such action shall be furnished by the department head to the affected employee, and a copy of the written statement shall be forwarded to the city manager and filed in the personnel folder of such employee within one working day of the effective date of the action. 
(4)  Dismissal. 
a.  When a regular employee is charged with misconduct that serves as just cause for dismissal, the department head shall place the employee on a three-day paid administrative suspension with a recommendation for dismissal. 
b.  A written statement specifically setting forth the reasons for suspension with a recommendation for dismissal shall be furnished by the person proposing the dismissal to the affected employee, and a copy of the written statement shall be furnished to the city manager within one working day of the effective date of the action. 
c.  The city manager shall ensure that a written notice of the charges has been furnished to the affected employee and shall conduct an investigation to ensure that the charges are substantiated and that no errors relevant to the charges were made. 
d.  Within three working days of the affected employee being notified of the charges, the city manager shall hold a conference at which the employee shall be authorized to present information which is pertinent to the charges on his behalf. 
e.  The city manager shall render a decision on the proposal for dismissal based on all of the relevant information. 
f.  The city manager shall advise the employee of his right to appeal the decision under the grievance procedure. 
(5)  Notification of right of appeal. Any written notification submitted to a regular employee who is being subjected to disciplinary action shall set forth the right of the employee to appeal such action to the mayor and city council in the manner set forth in section 70-30. Oral and written reprimands are not grievable actions. 
(Code 2005, § 70-41)  
Sec. 70-30. - Grievance and appeal procedures. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  City employee grievances should receive prompt consideration and equitable resolution.

With respect to those grievances which cannot be so resolved, employees shall be entitled to process the grievances as provided in this section. 
(2)  These procedures governing the processing of grievances and providing the right of appeal are established for the purpose of eliminating or correcting justifiable complaints or dissatisfaction of regular employees or certain complaints of probationary employees and applicants (see subsection (b) of this section); ensuring that all employees shall be afforded fair, equitable and expeditious review of their grievances without fear, coercion or discrimination; and providing a systematic and orderly method for resolving complaints and differences between employees and supervisory or management personnel. 
(b)  Procedure for grievance resolution. Any regular employee in the classified service who has been demoted, suspended, dismissed, or subjected to any other type of disciplinary action (except an oral or written reprimand), or who is aggrieved as a result of the interpretation and application of this article, and any applicant or employee (regular or probationary) who has been subjected to any alleged discriminatory action that is prohibited by federal law, shall have the right to utilize the grievance and appeal procedure set forth in this section. 
(1)  A formal grievance shall not be initiated unless and until the employee has discussed the grievance with the department head and city manager, or in the case of an applicant, with the city manager. Such discussion shall be held within ten working days after the occurrence or within ten working days after the employee becomes aware of the occurrence of a grievable matter. The department head, or city manager in the case of an applicant, shall render a decision on the matter within ten working days after the grievance has been discussed. 
(2)  Should the employee or applicant not be satisfied with the decision of the department head or city manager, the employee or applicant, within five working days, shall state the grievance in writing and file a standard grievance form with the city manager, setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The city manager shall make appropriate inquiries, consider all facts surrounding the action, and make every effort to resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the department head and the employee, or the applicant. 
(3)  Should no decision resulting in the settlement of the grievance be reached within ten working days after the filing of the written grievance, the employee or applicant, within five working days, may appeal to the mayor and city council. Such appeal shall be submitted through the city manager and shall be accompanied by all of the facts and information concerned with the grievance as well as any written responses of the department head. 
(4)  The mayor and city council shall, within ten working days after the receipt of an appeal, hold a hearing upon the appeal and consider the action complained of in the grievance.

Any member of the committee shall have the power to administer oaths and call witnesses and may compel the production of relevant books, records, and documents. 
c.  A copy of the decision of the mayor and city council shall be given to the affected employee and the department head of the affected employee, or to the applicant, within three working days following the completion of the hearing. 
(5)  The failure of supervisory employees to follow the steps outlined in this section shall result in conferring upon the employee the right automatically to proceed to the next step in the grievance procedure. The failure of the employee to follow the steps outlined in this section may result in the dismissal of the grievance at any step. 
(6)  In those cases where dismissal of an employee is involved, the city manager shall immediately notify the affected employee that, if requested, a hearing before the mayor and city council will be set up and held within ten working days of the action taken. At all such hearings, the department head shall be required to appear and explain the reasons for the dismissal. 
(7)  No punitive, discriminatory, or adverse action shall be taken against any employee or applicant on account of the filing of a grievance or an appeal.

c.  If a position vacated by a person entering the military service as stated in this section no longer exists at the time he qualifies to return to work, such person shall be entitled to be re-employed in another position of the same status, class and pay in the classified service, provided such re-employment does not necessitate the laying off of another employee.

Sec. 78-7. - Exemptions; suspension of regulations. 
(a)  Real estate signs, erected exactly on the property which is then for sale, shall be granted an automatic exemption from the prohibition of utilizing the city right-of-way which is contained in this chapter. This exemption applies only to real estate signs erected upon the exact piece of property which is for sale and which the sign is advertising the sale of. Such on-site, "For Sale" real estate signs may be installed in the city right-of-way, provided that they do not in any way create a hazardous sight line restriction related to the property (either at a street corner or any driveway onto the property). Any signs directing potential purchasers to this location must still comply with this chapter. 
(b)  The tenets of this chapter shall be suspended for 30 days prior to and one week after the citywide yard sale, which occurs in October.

(Code 2005, § 78-7; Ord. No. 01237, § 1(8-7-7), 3-10-2003)  
Sec. 78-8. - Display of street numbers. 
(a)  Applicability; assignment of numbers. All parcels of land in existence now, subdivided in the past and proposed to be subdivided in the future must have a street number assigned. The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for assigning these numbers in a logical, unbiased manner such that emergency response and general delivery vehicles shall be assisted in the efficient discharge of their duties. 
(b)  Display required. Every house, mobile home, individual apartment, business or other building having a street number assigned to it under the system of numbering in the city shall display such number in a readily visible manner and in compliance with the requirements of this section. Mobile home parks and apartment complexes shall also be required to have each individual pad, lot number or apartment building numbered in a multi-building development displayed in a readily visible manner from the main street or thoroughfare through the apartment complex or mobile home park (same as a manufactured home park) and in compliance with the requirements of this section. Such lot, pad or apartment building numbers shall be in sequence unless directional signs are provided for numbers not in sequence. 
(c)  Method of display. Assigned street numbers shall be affixed to the house, apartment, business or other building itself, provided that such house, apartment, business or other building is not more than 50 feet from the curbline, pavement edge or edge of the travelway of the street in front of the house, apartment, business or other building and the number is readily visible from the street by persons traveling along the street in each direction. Numbers must be located under a night (porch, garage) light where such a light exists such that the number is visible at night when the light is lit. Street numbers shall also be placed on both sides of an individual's mailbox such that when the arm or flag is in the up or down position the number is not hidden or blocked; or may be placed on signs located on the premises in front of the house, apartment, business or other building (in the case that the house, apartment, business or other building exceeds the 50-foot maximum standard), provided such signs are of a durable type and are located not more than 50 feet from the curbline, pavement edge or edge of the travelway of the street in front of the property, and provided that the number on such a sign shall be readily visible from the street by a person traveling along the street in each direction. Such a sign must not exceed two square feet in size, may be illuminated in a manner that does not disturb neighbors and must not be placed in the city or state street right-of-way or block the line of sight from any egress/entry point and city street corner line of sight. 
(d)  Size and color of numbers; use of reflective material. Street numbers affixed to buildings shall be a minimum of four inches in height. The number itself may or may not be of highly reflective material. However, if no night (porch, garage) light is affixed to the building, then the numbers must be displayed with a background of highly reflective material (as typically sold at a hardware store). Those affixed to mailboxes in the manner specified in this section shall be a minimum of three inches in height and must be displayed on highly reflective material (as typically sold at a hardware store). Numbers displayed in the front yard on a sign must be four inches tall and may be of either contrasting color with the background or with a highly reflective material (as typically sold at a hardware store). All such numbers not designed with a reflective background shall be of a color contrasting to the background so as to be clearly visible. Street numbers on buildings and on signs and the signs to which they are affixed shall be maintained at all times in good condition. 
(e)  Duty of property owner; violations. The obligation of complying with the provisions of this section shall be upon the owner of the property. The property owner shall have until January 1, 2002, to comply with the provisions of this section. If the provisions of this section shall be found to have been violated, notice shall be given to the owner of the property, or his agent, specifying the manner in which this section is being violated, and giving the owner 30 days to bring the property into compliance. Each day a violation of this section continues after the expiration date of such 30-day period shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as provided by this section. 
(f)  Temporary exemption; grandfather clause. On the date of approval of the ordinance from which this section is derived, all homes that at that time have pre-existing street numbers prominently displayed and installed shall be exempt from the increased mandatory minimum standards required in this section up until the time that the home is remodeled or renovated (including installation of a variety of siding options or repainting of the home), or a portion of the street number becomes unreadable, or the numbering system for the street is permanently altered. Owners of mailboxes which have pre-existing numbers installed are also exempt from the size requirement of this section but must comply with the double side standard. However, in all instances, any time the street numbers are updated or replaced, the new numbers must comply with the mandatory minimum standards of this section. All homes, regardless of pre-existing street numbers, must come into complete compliance with the mandatory minimum standards of this section no later than January 1, 2010. 
(g)  Responsibility for enforcement. The responsibility for making the inspections provided for in this section, and for the enforcement of the provisions of this section, shall rest upon the city manager or his designated representative, who is hereby authorized and empowered to make cases and issue written warnings initiating the 30-day grace period. Any such warnings issued shall be forwarded to the chief of police. Upon expiration of this 30-day period, all law enforcement agencies providing services to the city are authorized to make cases and issue summonses for violations. 
(h)  Penalties. Violators determined to be in violation of this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than $25.00 per violation and any other penalties which may be imposed by law by the municipal court judge of the city.

The TDDA chairperson will provide the applicant with the TDDA's written decision. 
(9)  Oath of maintenance. Property owner, in addition to the business owner and/or artist must sign form affirming their promise to maintain the mural in good condition (bright paint, no flaking or loss of paint) in perpetuity (at least ten years) or, in the case a mural is not maintained, have it repainted a typical monochrome color within 90 days' notice from the city.

(b)  In assessing the cost to be charged (which cost shall constitute a lien against the property abutting on each side of any street or portion of a street to be graded, paved, macadamized, or otherwise improved), each lot or parcel of land abutting on the portion of the street to be so improved shall be charged at an equal rate per foot of such frontage abutting on such portion of the street with its just pro rata share of the entire cost of such improvement, including improvement of intersections and intersecting streets, under the following method: one-third of the cost of such improvement shall be assessed against the property abutting on each side of the street or portion of street to be improved, so that two-thirds of the entire cost of such improvement shall be assessed against the property abutting on the street or portion of street to be so improved. The amount of such cost to be assessed per foot of frontage against the property abutting on each side of the street or portion of street to be so improved shall be determined by first determining the entire cost of such improvement, including the improvement of intersecting streets, ascertaining one-third of such entire cost as the amount to be assessed against the entire property abutting on each side of such street or portion of street to be improved, and dividing the amount so ascertained by the number of linear feet frontage on each side of the street or portion of street to be improved. 
(c)  After publication of a notice of the filing and presentation of a petition for improvement of any street or portion of street in the city, and of proposed action of the mayor and city council thereon, and following passage of a resolution by the mayor and city council providing for such improvement, the city manager shall prepare an estimate of the entire cost of such work and shall determine the amount of assessment to be levied against each improved parcel under the method of computation described in subsection (b) of this section. The city manager shall report his findings to the mayor and city council, and a copy of such findings shall be filed with the city clerk. 
(d)  The city manager shall publish a notice of the filing of his report, with a statement of the estimated entire cost of such improvement, the amount stated therein as an amount per foot frontage to be assessed against abutting property, and the total amount stated therein to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land abutting on the street or portion of street to be improved, with a further statement of the time and place of the meeting of the mayor and city council to consider and take action on the report. This notice shall be published in two consecutive issues of a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten days prior to the date of meeting of the mayor and city council for consideration thereof. 
(e)  After the publication of the notice, the mayor and city council shall meet at the time and place stated in the notice, for the purpose of acting on the report and determining the entire cost of such improvement, the amount per foot frontage to be assessed against the property abutting on the street or portion of street to be improved, and the amount to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land abutting on such street or portion of street. The city manager's report may be accepted, corrected, amended, or rejected by the mayor and city council. At such meeting any owner of property abutting on the street or portion of street proposed to be improved shall have the right to appear in person or by agent or attorney and to be heard on the question of the correctness of the amount of the entire cost of such improvement proposed by the mayor and city council, or the apportionment thereof, and shall have the right to introduce any competent evidence in support of his contentions. 
(f)  After considering the report of the city manager and hearing from any person who desires to be heard in reference to the matters stated, the mayor and city council shall finally determine all such matters, and shall by ordinance or resolution fix the amount of the entire cost of such improvement, the amount per foot frontage chargeable or to be assessed against the property abutting on the street or portion of street to be so improved, and the total amount of such cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land abutting on the street or portion of street to be improved, the determination of which, when so made by the mayor and city council, shall be final and conclusive, except as provided for in subsection (g) of this section. 
(g)  If after such determination and assessment by the mayor and city council it appears that the costs of such improvements have been underestimated, then the mayor and city council shall have the authority, by following the procedure provided for in this section and by the law governing the city, to make any additional assessments necessary against the property liable to assessment for such improvement. If it shall appear, when completed, and assessments therefor have been paid, that the cost of such improvements, including all expenses incurred by the city in connection with making the improvements, other than the one-third of such cost to be paid by the city, has been overestimated, then the assessments against the abutting property and against abutting property owners shall be reduced and rebated to the actual cost of such improvement, including any expense incurred by the city in connection with the improvement other than the one-third of such cost to be paid by the city.

ARTICLE III. - CLOSING A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY 
 
Sec. 86-55. - Conditions for closure. 
A public right-of-way may be closed if it, through the determination of the city manager, final approval by the mayor and city council, and with the consent of all affected property owners associated with the public access that this public right-of-way provides, has been determined to have been reduced to obsolescence and is of absolutely no use to the city and those affected property owners associated with the public access that this public right-of-way provides. 
(Code 2005, § 86-61; Ord. No. 01246, § 1(3-5-1), 2-14-2005)  
Sec. 86-56. - Procedure for closure. 
Upon petition from the abutting property owners and consent from those property owners who would be potentially adversely affected by the closure and sale of this obsolete public right-of-way, the city shall concur with the sale of this absolutely obsolete public right-of-way to the abutting property owners, provided that the following procedures are strictly adhered to: 
(1)  Petitioning abutting property owners must consult with the city manager or his designee concerning city's agreement that the subject public right-of-way is obsolete and the city has no need, now or in the future, for the property. Additionally, letters of agreement from all potentially affected property owners must be supplied by the petitioners to the city. However, the concurrence of the city manager in no way guarantees that the final decision of the mayor and city council shall be in agreement with that of the city manager. This final determination can only be made at a public meeting, autonomously, by the mayor and city council itself. 
(2)  Upon receiving a preliminary evaluation from the city manager or his designee that the property is indeed absolutely obsolete, petitioning property owners shall contact the city attorney to have the necessary legal paperwork drawn up. The petitioners is responsible for all associated legal fees to have the proper legal paperwork drawn up. A plat of the abutting property completed by a state certified land surveyor, showing the right-of-way, any and all public infrastructure running through the public right-of-way (or along property of the petitioners; and which shall require a dedicated easement shown upon such submitted plat), all abutting property and all affected property owners shall be provided by the petitioner, the cost to be borne by the petitioner, to the city manager for review. The city attorney or a designated representative from the city shall contact all potentially affected property owners and verify that they are aware of the petition to close the public right away, and they concur that this action shall not be a detriment to their use of the potentially affected property now and for perpetuity. 
(3)  The department of planning and public works, or a designated representative from the city designated so by the city manager, shall review the submitted plat and verify its accuracy. Specific elements to be reviewed shall be accuracy of property lines and dimensions, location and dimensions of public right-of-way and the square footage contained therein, and whether any city public infrastructure exists in the public right-of-way (such as water, sewer or gas lines). If such infrastructure exists, an easement of 40 feet for sewer and gas and a 20-foot easement for water lines shall be provided on the submitted plat of the public right-of-way to be closed. If all information appears to be in order, the city representative shall make such a recommendation to the city manager. If not, the reasons for the denial shall be relayed to the city manager. Upon all elements of the process being completed, the city manager shall schedule the public meeting on the road closure, which is normally a portion of the regular monthly mayor and city council meeting. 
(4)  It is hereby declared that the value of public property comprising public right-of-way shall be, at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived and until this value amount is updated or amended by the mayor and city council of the city through resolution, $5,000.00 per acre. For the purposes of applying this value to the public right-of-way which is to be sold to private parties, an acre of land shall be defined as containing exactly 44,000 square feet (a Tallapoosa acre). To calculate the value of the affected public right-of-way, the total square footage contained in the affected section of public right-of-way shall be ascertained. That figure shall be divided by 44,000 square feet to give a percentage of one Tallapoosa acre. This percentage shall be multiplied by the $5,000.00 figure, and that figure shall be the amount of money to be paid to the city by the recipient petitioners. 
Example: 300 feet of a 60-foot-wide public right-of-way is petitioned to be closed. The total square footage of this area is 18,000. 18,000 square feet is 40.9 percent of one 44,000 square foot Tallapoosa acre; this figure shall be rounded down to the lowest whole number, or 40 percent, in this example. Multiplying $5,000.00 by this percentage results in a figure of $2,000.00. This sales cost, in addition to all legal fees paid to the city attorney, must be paid to the city prior to the city deeding the land to the private property owners. 
(5)  At the discretion of a sole petitioner where two individuals would receive a portion of the right-of-way (generally, 50 percent of the right-of-way goes to the property owner abutting either side of the right-of-way), the sole petitioner may pay for the entire sales cost, but 50 percent of the right-of-way would still be deeded to the other abutting right-of-way land owner. 
(Code 2005, § 86-62; Ord. No. 01246, § 1(3-5-2), 2-14-2005)  
Sec. 86-57. - Refund of purchase fee. 
In the case where a property developer needs to close a public right-of-way to improve the quality of their development, due to the location of the old public right-of-way interfering with the best and highest use development practice, a property developer shall be provided with the ability to have the purchase price of the closed city right-of-way refunded, provided that the following stipulations are fulfilled: 
(1)  The property developer follows the procedures contained in section 106-206(i), submitting a preliminary and final plat. The final plat must be submitted to the city and ready for approval by the mayor and city council within six months of the public right-of-way being closed by the mayor and city council. 
(2)  The newly submitted property subdivision includes newly dedicated public right-of-way for the construction of new roads and other public infrastructure. Such newly dedicated public right-of-way must be at least 75 percent of the acreage quantity of the closed right-of-way, for a full 100 percent refund. If less than 75 percent, purchase fees paid to have the old city right-of-way closed shall be refunded based on a comparison between closed old right-of-way acreage and newly created right-of-way acreage; whatever that percentage (one percent to 74 percent), that percentage shall be multiplied by the purchase fee and that quantity refunded to the fee payee or petitioner, if those are different.

Terms not defined in this section shall have their customary dictionary definitions where not inconsistent with the context. 
Building line means the line parallel to the street right-of-way which indicates the minimum required front yard setback at which building construction may begin. Such setback shall be measured from the specific public street's right-of-way or, in the case of flag developments, shall be measured from the rear or side lot line of the lot between the proposed lot and the public street right-of-way; and in accordance with the front yard setback for that specific zoning district. At this line or point of intersection, the minimum lot width shall be measured. 
Lot means a portion or parcel of land separated from other portions or parcels by description as on a subdivision plat or record of survey map or as described by metes and bounds, and intended for transfer or for building development. For the purpose of this chapter, the term "lot" does not include any portion of a dedicated right-of-way. 
Setback, front yard, means mandated minimum open space free of buildings. Such space exists between the public street right-of-way and the location of a building. Such setback shall be measured from the right-of-way of the individual street (whereby the right-of-way shall vary) and comply with the setback requirements of the specific zoning district. In the case of flag developments, the front yard setback shall be measured from the rear or side lot line of the lot immediately facing the proposed front yard of the residential building (generally determined by the front door or main entrance of the building). 
Street means a public right-of-way, for vehicular traffic, whether designated as an avenue, boulevard, road, highway, expressway, etc., which is intended to provide the principal means of access to abutting property. A street shall attain the status of a public right-of-way or public street through dedication, design and construction in accordance with article IV, division 2, subdivision II of this chapter and final acceptance by the mayor and city council.

Marginal access street means a minor street parallel and adjacent to major streets and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic. 
Minor street means a street used primarily for access to the abutting properties. 
Subdivider means the person having such a proprietary interest in the land to be subdivided as will authorize the maintenance of proceedings to subdivide such land under this chapter, or the authorized agent of such person for the purpose of proceeding under this chapter. 
Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets, and includes resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition: 
(1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards of the city; and/or 
(2)  The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved.

(a)  Estimate of gross receipts. If any operator fails to make a return, the clerk shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the operator or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total rentals in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the periods in respect to which the person failed to make the return, and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the clerk. Upon the basis of this estimate the clerk shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid the city, adding to the sum thus determined a penalty equal to 15 percent thereof. One or more determinations may be made of the amount due for one or for more than one monthly period.

When it is determined by a return filed, or by the clerk having made a determination under the provisions of section 94-131 or 94-132, that tax is due and payable to the city under the provisions of this article, the city manager may, at any time within three years after determination that such tax is due and payable, bring an action in the courts of this state, of any other state, or of the United States, in the name of the city to collect the amount of tax payable to the city together with interest thereon and penalties, court costs, attorneys' fees and other legal fees incident thereto. The bringing of such an action shall not be a prerequisite for the issuance of a fi. fa. under the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. 
(b)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount of tax under this article sells or transfers his business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price of the business to cover the amount of tax, interest thereon and penalties, and pay such sum over to the city, unless the operator liable for the tax delivers to the purchaser or transferee, as the case may be, at the time of the sale or transfer, a certificate from the clerk showing that all tax returns required of such operator have been filed and all taxes shown as being payable on the returns have been paid in full. 
(c)  Liability for failure to withhold tax; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser or transferee of a business fails to withhold the required amount of the purchase price, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells or transfers his business, or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later. 
(d)  Issuance of fi. fa. The clerk is hereby authorized to issue a fi. fa. for execution and levy to satisfy the amount of any tax, penalty or interest due but not paid under the provisions of this article.

ARTICLE VI. - STREETLIGHT TAX DISTRICTS[5] 

Footnotes:

Cross reference— Streets, sidewalks and other public places, ch. 98. 
 
Sec. 94-156. - Declaration of policy; purpose. 
The mayor and city council do hereby declare that it shall promote the health, safety, and general public welfare of the citizens of the city to provide for the erection of streetlights in the public rights-of-way in the city. To that end, therefore, the ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted in order to effect the creation of streetlight tax districts and to provide for construction of streetlights in the public rights-of-way in the city. This article shall not be deemed to apply to property in the city other than in the public rights-of-way. 
(Code 2005, § 94-181; Ord. No. 01233, § 1(3-5-1), 1-13-2003)  
Sec. 94-157. - Creation of districts; register; assessment of costs. 
(a)  There are created hereby special tax districts which shall be known as streetlight tax districts, which shall be identified by a number assigned by the department of planning. Each such streetlight tax district identified by a streetlight tax district number shall contain and include the tax parcel number of each lot within the tax district. Existing streetlight districts shall become streetlight tax districts upon the enactment of the legislation from which this article is derived, and new streetlight tax districts shall be created upon application or proper petition and approval of the mayor and city council as provided in this article. Each new streetlight tax district so created shall be assigned a number and shall contain the tax parcel numbers of each lot contained therein. 
(b)  A register of streetlight tax districts shall be maintained in the office of the department of planning and the city clerk. Such registers shall be available to the public for inspection upon reasonable notice to either of these offices. 
(c)  The cost of providing and maintaining streetlight services as provided by this article shall be borne by owners of the property receiving that service. The charge therefor shall be such as is determined by resolution of the mayor and city council, giving consideration for the streetlights, electrical service-charges, and the size and number of the lots serviced by the streetlights. In the event of excessive vandalism to streetlights within a district which results in the city being billed for repairs, the city may prorate these repair bills and add a pro-rata share of these bills to the charge. Charges shall be assessed against all lots within the streetlight tax district whether or not the lot is located within the boundaries of a particular subdivision, so long as the lot is located within the boundaries of the streetlight tax district. 
(1)  Residential lots. Residential lots shall be assessed for the annual cost of the streetlights in the following fashion: If all lots in the streetlight tax district are the same size (up to 25 percent variance off average lot size in district), then total cost of streetlight operation for a year as determined by the electrical utility shall be divided equally by the number of lots in the streetlight tax district. If the lots in the proposed district are not similar in size, then the total cost of the streetlight operation for a year shall be divided in two. Half of this figure shall be assessed as provided in the previous sentence. The other half shall be assigned based on total acreage divided by the 50 percent cost, then multiplied by the acreage of the specific lot (for the purposes of this mathematical equation, one acre shall be defined as 44,000 square feet). 
(2)  Commercial lots. Commercial lots shall be assessed by taking the total value of the lots within the proposed streetlight tax district, determining the needed millage rate to pay for the total cost of streetlight operation for a year as determined by the electrical utility, and then multiplying the needed millage rate by the specific lot's value. This calculation shall be required to be done annually unless, from one year to another, there is no increase in value of any of the properties within the proposed streetlight tax district.

Sec. 94-158. - Collection of charges; administration. 
(a)  The charges for street lighting in each streetlight tax district shall be paid as a streetlight district tax, and shall be collected concurrently with the ad valorem tax billed to each lot or lot resident within each streetlight tax district. 
(b)  The administration of the services provided for in this article and all billing and accounting shall be the responsibility of the city clerk and department of planning. The department of planning shall be responsible for accepting applications for streetlight tax districts, evaluating applications for proper design, and assigning a designation number to each approved streetlight tax district, as well as other possible necessities in this area of administration. The city clerk shall be responsible for all billing and accounting, and other administrative necessities of this nature. 
(c)  The office of the city clerk shall be responsible for the timely collection of the tax assessed to each streetlight tax district, but it shall not be responsible for accounting beyond its internal accounting procedures in order to provide an adequate record of the collection and the transmittal of the funds collected. 
(d)  The mayor and city council shall have the authority to levy reasonable administrative fees for the application process, evaluation, establishment, and operation of each streetlight taxing district. Such a fee shall be a flat charge to each parcel within the designated streetlight tax district. Such a fee shall be set, and adjusted periodically, as determined by the mayor and city council through resolution.

Sec. 94-159. - Lien for unpaid charges. 
In addition to any other rights of collection for late or unpaid charges, the city shall have the rights available to it under the laws of the state for assessment and the creation of a lien upon the property of the owner receiving the service provided, together with all rights of execution, levy, foreclosure and sale. 
(Code 2005, § 94-184; Ord. No. 01233, § 1(3-5-4), 1-13-2003)  
Sec. 94-160. - Deposit required; forfeiture. 
In addition to the other charges authorized in this article, the city shall have the right to require deposits from the lot owners receiving the streetlight service in such amount as shall be determined by the mayor and city council. This deposit shall be held by the city as security for payment of services rendered pursuant to this article, and the city shall have the authority to set off against the deposit for nonpayment for services at such times and on such occasions as shall be determined by the city. Notice of such set-off shall be given to the lot owner by mail at the address of the property serviced by the streetlights, although advance notice of such set-off shall not be required. In the event of a reduction in the deposit of a property owner because of failure to pay charges assessed pursuant to this article, the lot owner shall be required to restore the deposit to its required level upon request by the city. 
(Code 2005, § 94-185; Ord. No. 01233, § 1(3-5-5), 1-13-2003)  
Sec. 94-161. - Streetlight construction by developers. 
(a)  All developers of residential subdivisions in the city with lots less than five acres in size and which shall require plat approval by the mayor and city council in accordance with chapter 90, pertaining to subdivisions, and all developers of shopping centers, industrial parks and similar such developments, shall be required, at their own expense, to provide streetlight services in the public rights-of-way in such developments in conformity with this article. 
(b)  Such developers, real estate agents or home/property owners attempting to sell or resell such property which resides within an approved or proposed streetlight tax district must inform prospective buyers of the existence, and the financial burden (or potential burden), of the streetlight tax district prior to closing on the property. 
(c)  Such developers, at the time of the submission of the preliminary plat or drawings of the development, or at the time of application for a building permit, whichever shall first occur, shall present a proposed streetlight layout which details the proposed streetlight service for the development. The proposal presented by the developer must be evaluated and approved by the department of planning, city manager or other designated city official prior to obtaining any building permit for that development. The proposal must comply with the following standards: 
(1)  All fixtures and standards/poles installed or to be used shall be approved not only by the city, but also by the utility company which will provide electricity to the streetlights and which will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. 
(2)  Each corner or entrance (not to include the driveways of single-family residential districts) shall have two fixtures installed, one on each side of the corner or entrance. The fixtures at these locations may be less powerful than others in the district due to their relatively close proximity; however, they must still provide minimum footcandle requirements. 
(3)  All fixtures shall meet Illumination Engineering Society (IES) standards. Each fixture shall be identified and the manufacturer's stated illuminative capacity detailed in the plan. Based upon these standards, the fixtures shall be properly distributed to attain minimum illumination standards as established by the American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting of the IES. The space between each displayed fixture must be measured and depicted in feet. 
(d)  Should the department of planning disapprove the streetlight layout, the grounds for disapproval shall be communicated in writing to the developer. Any such disapproval by the department of planning may be appealed to the mayor and city council by filing a request for review with the city manager within 30 days from the date of the written notice of disapproval. The department of planning shall, at that point, transmit to the mayor and city council all papers and related documents pertaining to the action taken by the department of planning, and the mayor and city council shall review the matter at the next regularly scheduled public meeting. The mayor and city council may reverse or affirm, entirely or in part, the decision of the department of planning. If the streetlight tax district is approved without trouble or with requested corrections, this approval shall be conveyed to the developer by the department of planning, city manager or other city official in writing and delivered by regular means. 
(e)  At the time of submission of the final plat for the subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial parks, office parks or other such development on which streetlights have been constructed at the expense of the developer in the city right-of-way, the developer shall pay to the city in advance a sum equal to the customary streetlight rates charged by the electrical utility for similar developments for a period of one year, or the developer may have the electrical utility direct bill him for all associated costs to install and operate the proposed streetlights for one year, such one-year period starting upon the complete installation of the streetlights within the designated district. Completion is to be ascertained by the department of planning and the electrical utility. 
(f)  The department of planning shall not issue any certificates of occupancy until such time as all the provisions of this section have been satisfied, and until the developers further submit to the department of planning proof of payment for construction and installation of the streetlights in the areas sought to be dedicated, together with a copy of an executed agreement with the appropriate utility company for complete maintenance of all streetlights and related structures, wires and installations. 
(g)  Upon the recommendation of the department of planning, city manager or other designated city official, the mayor and city council shall approve or deny the final plat by resolution at a regularly scheduled mayor and city council meeting not later than 30 days following the submission of the recommendation of the review staff. The streetlight tax district is created upon the approval by the mayor and city council of the final plat. The date of creation for the streetlight tax district shall be the date of the approval of the final plat. 
(h)  Notwithstanding all other provisions of the subdivision laws, rules and regulations of planning and zoning of the city and other ordinances, any developer, contractor or other person securing approval in accordance with this section may be required to post a bond equal to the installation cost and one year's electrical power for the street lighting. This bond, if required, must be given at the time of written approval of the design as specified in subsection (c) of this section. The bond shall be payable to the city and will provide that it shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the city or its designated representative shall have indicated that the work required for the construction and installation of the street lighting in a subdivision or other multifamily residential, commercial or industrial development has been satisfactorily completed.

Sec. 94-162. - Creation of district upon petition of property owner. 
(a)  Any lot owner in any area of the city may present a request for the creation of a streetlight tax district to the department of planning, city manager or other designated city official. Upon receipt of the request, the department of planning, city manager or other designated city official shall determine the appropriate boundaries for a streetlight tax district which will serve the lot owner presenting the request and neighboring lot owners. The lot owner presenting the request shall then prepare a plat, or an adequate depiction of the proposed district, such as that which is shown on the city tax maps (if all lots within the proposed residential district are the same size), showing this proposed street lighting district, and a petition for the creation of the proposed lighting district shall then be circulated among the lot owners in the proposed district, by the lot owner presenting the request. If 60 percent of the lot owners in the proposed district sign the petition for the creation of a streetlight tax district, or if those signing the petition compose 60 percent of the total assessed tax value within the designated streetlight tax district, the petition shall be presented to the mayor and city council. The mayor and city council shall conduct a public hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not to create the proposed streetlight tax district, giving consideration to safety and economic factors in making such determination. Unless 100 percent of the lot owners have signed the petition, the public hearing shall be advertised one time in the official organ of the city, and signs shall be posted in the proposed streetlight tax district giving notice of the hearing at least 15 but no more than 45 days before the public hearing. The number and size of the signs shall be such as is required by chapter 106, pertaining to zoning, for a request to rezone property. 
(b)  The petition for creation of the proposed streetlight tax district must be returned to the department of planning, city manager or other designated city official within 90 days after it is obtained from such city official's office. The department of planning, city manager or city clerk, at their sole discretion, will verify the signatures on the petition prior to advertising the public hearing. 
(c)  All other provisions of this article with respect to payment for street lighting, including provisions for required deposits, shall apply equally to the services created and provided.

Sec. 94-198. - Short title. 
This article shall be known as the "City of Tallapoosa Energy Excise Tax Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 01278, exh. 2012-B(94-198), 12-10-2012)  
Sec. 94-199. - Findings and intent. 
The ordinance from which this article is derived is being adopted to address the interest of public finance. State law authorizes counties, or municipalities under certain circumstances, to impose an excise tax on the sale or use of energy, not otherwise exempt per the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-8-3.2. The imposition of the excise tax on the sale or use of energy county wide is contingent upon the enactment of an ordinance by the governing authority of the county. After a properly called meeting between the county and its respective municipalities, the county has elected not to participate in an intergovernmental agreement with its municipalities and has decided not to call for passage of an ordinance to impose and levy an excise tax on sale and use of energy within the county. When a county determines that it will not participate in the imposition of the excise tax on energy, one or more municipalities within the non-participating county may elect to pass an ordinance for the imposition, levy and collection of an excise tax on the sale and use of energy within its municipal boundaries, in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-8-115. In order for the city to properly impose such excise tax within its municipal boundaries, the city must follow all of the applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 13, art. 6, one provision of which is the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

(1)  US 78, from city limit to city limit. 
(2)  GA 120, from mile marker 0.0, east, to the city limits. 
(d)  Designated through truck route, north and south, mandatory route. 
(1)  North starting point: GA 100, beginning at the intersection with the northerly city limit, continuing south until GA 100 intersects with US 78 (these streets are known locally as Bowdon Street and Robertson Avenue). Upon intersecting with US 78, the designated through truck route for north and south bound through truck traffic must remain on US 78 until US 78 intersects with the northern terminus of the GA 100 Truck Spur. The north/south through truck route then proceeds south along the GA 100 Truck Spur. Upon arriving at the southern terminus of the GA 100 Truck Spur at GA 100, all through truck traffic must turn left, south, such that the progress of the truck is in a southerly direction, towards I-20. From this point, the through truck traffic route continues south until the southerly city limits is arrived upon. 
(2)  South starting point: GA 100, beginning at the intersection of the southerly city limit, or the exit ramps of 1-20, continuing north along GA 100 under I-20 until GA 100 intersects with the southern terminus of the GA 100 Truck Spur, all through trucks must turn right at this intersection, and follow the GA 100 Truck Spur for its complete route until arriving at the northern terminus of the GA 100 Truck Spur at US 78. Upon intersection with US 78, the designated through truck route, all through truck traffic must remain on US 78 until US 78 intersects with GA 100 going north, at this intersection GA 100 is also known locally as Robertson Avenue. From this intersection, in a northerly direction, GA 100 travels north along Robertson Avenue to a signalized intersection with Taliaferro Street. At this intersection, GA 100 turns approximately 45 degrees west, and becomes locally known as Bowdon Street. Bowdon Street/GA 100 continues in a generally northerly direction until passing out of the city limits near Sheryl Ann Bridges Road, where the city designated through truck traffic route ends.

The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city.

Sec. 102-12. - Accidental water leaks. 
In a case where a city water customer has an accidental water leak, which consumes more water than average, the respective customer shall be billed for the water consumed during this water leak timeframe in compliance with the following system: 
(1)  Leak must be verified by city staff (filling a private pool is not an accidental water leak), and the identified leak must be repaired by the customer. 
(2)  The average water consumption for the three billing periods (months) immediately preceding the billing period (month) during which the leak was discovered shall be calculated. 
(3)  The average consumption figure shall be subtracted from the amount billed, arriving at a figure which shall be termed the accidental leak consumption amount. This amount shall be multiplied by the current wholesale rate charged to the city by the county water authority. The cost of this accidental leak consumption shall be added to the cost billed for the average water consumption. These two figures combined, shall be the total fees that the customer owes the city. 
(4)  Sewage fees billed resulting from, and for the amount consumed during the accidental leak (not to include the fees billed from the average water consumption figure), shall be zeroed out (not billed/charged). 
(5)  In the case where there is not a billing history going back at least three months, a new account user shall be billed as follows: 
a.  The minimum monthly billed amount, 2,000 gallons, shall be subtracted from the accidental leak consumption amount, then follow the same mathematical calculation, and process, as described in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
b.  In the case of a hardship or other such reason for deviating from this policy and procedure, the customer must present his case to the mayor and city council for disposition. Decisions shall be rendered on a case-by-case basis, based on specific facts connected to each specific appeal.

(1)  PUD, Planned Unit Development. Master planned residential district, usually a mix of rental/resident owned property. Must have open space/recreational land set aside and dedicated for such (development rights assigned to a land trust in perpetuity, such as the Nature Conservancy), as well as being completely installed prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued. Property density in section developed may be much higher than regularly permitted. Must receive permission from planning coordinator, planning commission and the mayor and council. 
(2)  PMURD, Planned Mixed-Use Residential Development. Master planned, primarily residential district, mixed-use development, which also contains commercial/retail land uses.

Development density may be substantially higher than permitted in other districts. Must have open space/recreational land set aside and dedicated for such, as well as being completely installed, as well as have the public school constructed (or a bond dedicated equal to the cost of the school construction plus 25 percent), prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued (such as the development rights being deeded to land trust/conservancy in perpetuity). If enacted at the time, various impact fees may be waived by the mayor and council and/or county board of education (or whatever governmental unit adopted, instituted and collects such fees). Must receive permission from planning coordinator, planning commission, county board of education and the mayor and council. 
(4)  Approval process. 
a.  The purpose of these large-scale master planned communities is to provide greater efficiency/economy of scale through higher density residential development, permanently preserved conservation tracks and close proximity of retail stores, where appropriate; which hopefully will increase walkability and decrease the number of car trips generated daily on a per-capita basis. In relation to PESS, it is intended to strive for a Garden City environment similar to Radburn, NJ; where the elementary school/civic area/green pasture are the prime focal points, and where housing is arranged around this focal point, and lastly, where pedestrian activity is separated from automotive movement, thus substantially increasing family safety. An application fee of $150.00, in addition to any fees for rezoning and other site plan review fees, is required. 
b.  A planned unit development shall be located in an area where public and private facilities and services are available, or will be made available by the time the development reaches the stage of any initial availability of occupancy and shall not be on less than 100 acres.

4.  A tabulation of total acreage of the site and the designation for various uses, such as parking, structures, streets, parks, playgrounds, schools, residential areas, commercial areas. 
5.  Building density of residential areas. 
6.  Preliminary site plan/subdivision plans. Must meet all subdivision regulations in relation to road and infrastructure requirements (sewer, storm, potable water design). 
7.  Proposed circulation of vehicle and pedestrian traffic. 
8.  Approval block for the county board of education, city planning commission and the mayor and city council. 
9.  Statement of concurrence/awareness: All public facilities, including schools (if applicable) and recreation areas/conservation areas (conservation easement), sewer and water, streets, etc., shall be completed prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for any residential structure. 
10.  Plans shall be submitted to the planning coordinator, city manager or his designee. They shall be reviewed for compliance and, if in the opinion of that official, are deemed to meet all standards, a public hearing with the planning commission shall be scheduled. If the planning commission provides it approval, the plans shall be presented to the mayor and council (except PESS). Upon receiving approval from the mayor and council, the plans final plat shall be recorded and the rezoning affective for one year, if construction does not begin. 
11.  Prior to being submitted to the mayor and council, PESS plans must be approved by the county board of education, or its successor, including whatever approval is required from the state board of education. 
(b)  Within all planned community districts, the following uses are strictly prohibited: 
(1)  Junkyards.

Sec. 106-150. - Table of permitted uses. 
(a)  All specific, current, easily identified land uses, locally identified, shall be maintained in a separate document known as the "Table of Permitted Uses." All current, locally known, or commonly and generally known, land uses shall be identified in this table and assigned, a zoning district category, where they shall be permitted to be established. Said table shall be made available to the public for their use, at the offices of the department of planning or at the desk of the city clerk. Copies shall be made available to the public for a fee of $1.00 as of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and said fee may be amended by resolution by the mayor and council from time to time. 
(b)  Any land use not locally identified and brought to the attention of the city by an individual interested in pursuing this land use within the city limits, shall be assigned a temporary permitted land use district by the planning coordinator, city manager or his designee, provided that such a business is similar to those businesses already permitted in such a specific district and which shall not distort or irreparably damage the character or violate the restrictions, of such a specific district. This designation shall be relayed to the interested party in writing within five business days of the decision. This recommendation shall be presented by the planning coordinator (or designate) to the planning commission at their regular monthly meeting for final approval or final assignment. If the individual interested in pursuing this type of land use feels the permitted land use zoning district category designation is incorrect, he may appeal to the planning commission, city council or board of zoning appeals in writing, in hopes that the designated zoning district category can be altered from that which was recommended by the planning coordinator. Failure to appeal this decision, or a subsequent change by the planning commission, within 45 days from the latter decision being rendered, voids this appeal process.

(1)  Purpose and intent. It is in the public interest to maximize efficiency of the utilization of public services, infrastructure, and facilities as a means to achieve balanced growth and to provide a cost effective method for municipal service delivery. Within the residential areas of the identified traditional, high density, walkable, core historic city residential district, and delineated on the "High Density Historically Accurate Residential Infill Subdivision Overlay District," there exists an opportunity to achieve maximum utilization of land resources that have been bypassed or under-utilized in the development of the traditional, historic urban area. An increase in the density normally allowed by the underlying zoning district (RH) is deemed an appropriate incentive to promote infill development and redevelopment within this historic urban residential core for single-family residential detached district, provided that the preferred neighborhood compatibility standards are respected. 
(2)  Applicability. The high density historically accurate residential infill subdivision overlay district (the overlay district) implements the infill development zone. The provisions of this overlay district apply to all parcels designated within the overlay district which wish to utilize the platting density permitted in the underlying zoning district (an RH option), and/or parcels of land which contain two acres or less; and comply with the eligibility criteria standards. The boundary of this district shall be shown in the official zoning map of the city and all parcels contained within the zone, which meet the eligibility section below, are able to utilize the provisions set forth in this section. 
High Density Historically Accurate Residential Infill Subdivision Overlay District 
 
(3)  Land development regulations. All land use and development, including, but not limited to, buildings, driveways, parking areas, street buffers, tree protection/landscaping and pedestrian/bicycle ways, shall be located and/or provided for in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and land development regulations, except as modified by this section. 
(4)  Eligibility. Properties may utilize the high density subdivision allowed in the overlay districts' infill development zone (RH district density) provided they meet the following criteria: 
a.  The original/initial parcel of land which the proposed subdivision is coming from does not exceed two acres. 
b.  The parcel must be served by public water and sanitary sewer (septic tanks are prohibited). 
c.  Parcel must be zoned one of the three RH designations, or R-200, R-150, R-100, R-75 or R-50, as shown on the city zoning map adopted on December 12, 2005, or on subsequently adopted maps. 
d.  The new parcel must contain at least 5,000 square feet and a minimum of 50 feet street frontage. 
e.  The original parcel, after the proposed subdivision is complete, must contain at least 5,000 square feet and have at least 50 feet street frontage. Proposed submitted plat must show all parcels; those newly created and those from the original, source parcel. 
f.  Proposed new homes must contain a minimum of 1,200 heated square feet. 
(5)  Architectural consistency. It is presumed that homes constructed shall be architecturally consistent with the characteristics of the surrounding homes and area. 
(6)  Approval process. Standard plat approval process must be followed.

(b)  Any permit issued after the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be valid for a maximum of 12 months, from the date of issue. Upon the expiration of this permit, if work has not passed a final inspection and received a certificate of occupancy, a stop work order shall be issued and a new permit, at the current fee schedule then in effect, shall be required to be purchased. Any permit issued prior to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived being adopted shall be valid for no more than 18 months from the date of issue. Any of the previously issued permits which are currently past the 18-month maximum validity period or shall expire in the upcoming months, shall be notified of this expiration in the following manner: 
(1)  The permit holder shall be given a notice of expiration. Said notice shall inform permit holder of the controlling regulation and the fact that their permit has expired. This notice shall give the permit holder an additional 30 days, from the date of the notice being issued, to complete the work authorized in said original and now expired, permit. If at the expiration of this 30-day period the work has not been completed and the project given and passed a final inspection, the holder shall be informed that the previous permit has expired, all work must cease, and a new permit purchased at the rates in effect at the current time, and as though no other permits have been purchased (i.e., if it is a new home project, the building permit, plumbing, electrical, mechanical and grading permit must all be purchased again). The city inspector shall inspect the construction project and provide a list of items to be completed by the holder of the expired permit. The second, or reissue permit, shall be valid for a period no longer than six months. If it too expires, than a third permit, valid no longer than 30 days, shall be issued. All permits shall be purchased at the then current fee schedule. If the third permit expires, the city shall seek a court injunction and take action under the Standard Unsafe Building Abatement Code. 
(2)  If the original permit was issued without cost, the second and third permits acquired due to a lack of completing the project in a workmanlike manner shall be reissued only after a reissue fee of $50.00 is assessed for the subsequent permits. 
(c)  Stop work orders. The planning coordinator, city building inspector, chief of police, city manager or his designee, is duly authorized to issue stop work orders for cause, such as failure to obtain a building permit, unsafe work conditions or violations of Soil and Erosion Control Law, etc. Said stop work order shall be issued to the property owner and general contractor and require that the job site be conspicuously posted by the planning coordinator, or a city official so designated by the city manager. Any and all employees who defy this posted stop work order shall be arrested and cited and be subject to punishment in accordance with section 1-7. Destruction and/or removal of the posted stop work order shall result in the property owner and/or the general contractor's agent responsible for the work, being cited in accordance with section 1-7. 
(d)  Failure to obtain a building permit prior to work begun. If a project is begun without having received a building permit prior to the work beginning, an additional fee, the higher of either double the regular fee to be charged or $50.00, shall be assessed; regardless of whether the work needing the permit would otherwise be assessed a fee or not. This fee shall not be assessed until the city effectively advertises the requirement to obtain a building permit, either through notices in the water bills or articles in the Tallapoosa Journal. A minimum of six individual publication efforts, at least one month apart from each other, must be accomplished prior to this failure to obtain a building permit in a timely manner fee being assessed. This fee is in effect as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and completion of the advertising requirements, and may be changed from time to time by the mayor and council by resolution.

Sec. 106-210. - Preventing intentional avoidance of paying permit fees. 
To prevent the intentional staging of property improvements in such a manner that the improvements to a single property are separated/staggered so that the cost of the project is less than the threshold whereby a permit fee is required, the following regulation shall apply: 
(1)  Upon the issuance of a permit, which due to the declared value of the property improvement (if said value declaration is conspicuously low and inaccurate, the building inspector is authorized to assign a project value based upon the standard cost estimation process), is issued without a fee being charged, any project which is begun within 12 months of the date of this permit being issued and which has not been identified upon this permit, shall be added to the original permit which was issued without any fee. If the accumulative combination of these projects exceeds the fee threshold, a fee shall than be assessed. A certificate of occupancy or passage of a final inspection prior to this 12-month period passing shall not affect this regulation. 
(2)  It is recommended that, upon the fee threshold being reached and a fee charged, all potential projects planned during the next 12 months be included upon this permit to avoid multiple permits being issued to a single property improvement project within a period of 12 months after the initial permit has been obtained.
