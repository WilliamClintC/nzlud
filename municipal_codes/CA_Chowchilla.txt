\PREFACE 
    The Chowchilla, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1979, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Richard H. Hargrove, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 5, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 498-19 , passed May 28, 2019.

\HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 5, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 5, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 31, 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.1., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

F.  Substantial improvements to existing infrastructure supporting the project area, particularly sewerage, water, storm drainage, curb, gutter, sidewalk, and improvement to traffic circulation throughout the project area, including better access to developable properties from major arterial streets too remove existing impediments to the economic development of the community;

At no point shall tax revenues be used to fund public safety expenditures below forty-four percent of that years' general fund operating budget unless approved by a four-fifths vote of the city council.

    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter. 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home park unless such occupancy in the mobile home park is for any period of more than thirty days, or unless the tenant of said mobile home is an employee of the owner or operator of the mobile home, or similar structure, or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

F.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted period of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the provisions of this chapter may be considered.

3.16.030 - Rules and regulations-Enforcement-City administrator authority. 
    The city administrator shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter as may be necessary or desirable to aid in the enforcement of this chapter.

3.16.040 - Rate. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount which shall be from time to time set by resolution of the city council. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the city administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city administrator.

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the city administrator. The city administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return.

    If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the provisions of this chapter, the city administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any such tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the city administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by the provisions of this chapter. In the event such determination is made, the city administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten days after the service or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the city administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed.

If such an application is made, the city administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties shall not be so fixed. After such hearings the city administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is filed as provided in Section 3.16.150 of this chapter.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the city administrator. 
B.  Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the city administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the city administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the city administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

2.  To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable television system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets or other public places within the designated service area. 
3.  To maintain and operate said franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification, and distribution of television and radio signals and for the delivery of cable services, and such other services as may be permitted by law. 
4.  To set forth the obligations of a grantee under the franchise. 
B.  It is unlawful for any person to construct, install or operate a cable television system in the city within any street without a properly granted franchise awarded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  A franchise grantee hereunder shall be for a term established in the franchise agreement, commencing on the grantor's adoption of an ordinance or resolution authorizing the franchise. 
D.  A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed upon application by the grantee pursuant to the provisions of applicable state and federal law and of this chapter. 
E.  Any franchise shall be valid within all the territorial limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. 
F.  This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
G.  1.  Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed; provided that such consent shall not be required for transactions between any parent, subsidiary or commonly owned entities. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the council shall be null and void. The granting of a security interest in any grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation solely for purposes of financing, shall not by itself be considered a transfer for the purposes of this section. 
2.  The requirements of subsection (G)(1) of this section shall apply to any change of control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. The acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons acting in privity of forty percent of the voting shares or interests in grantee or any person which controls grantee shall be presumed to constitute a change of control of grantee, but grantee shall be entitled to rebut such presumption. 
3.  Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee. Such notification shall be considered by grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply. 
4.  For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, sale, transfer, lease, assignment, sublease, disposal, or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall assist grantor in such inquiry. In seeking grantor's consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes any required application identical or substantially similar to FCC Form 394 "Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment of Control of Cable Television Franchise," or any successor form. An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than sixty days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, character, and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise on such terms and conditions as it determines in its discretion. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. 
5.  Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within thirty days of assuming such control that will insure, to the grantor's satisfaction, continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements at at least the same level during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer the franchise to another grantee. 
6.  Upon consummation of the transfer, grantee shall pay grantor an application fee to cover grantor's reasonable out-of-pocket processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise or of control of the franchise, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars. Any such application fee shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise. 
H.  1.  Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit within the public streets and rights-of-way in the city, subject to any service area and line extension requirements of the franchise agreement. 
2.  After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, grantee shall provide service to any requesting subscriber within that service area within thirty days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty-day period, on reasonable terms and conditions. 
I.  Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law, provided that if the grantor grants an additional franchise on terms more favorable to the second grantee (whether by the grant of greater benefits or the imposition of lesser obligations), then the initial grantee shall have the right to renegotiate its franchise to incorporate the more favorable terms. 
J.  1.  Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
a.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage. 
b.  The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service. 
c.  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way. 
2.  Each grantee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city shall offer service to all residences in the city, in accordance with construction and service schedules mutually agreed upon between grantor and grantee, line extension policies, and applicable law. 
3.  Grantor may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in grantor's opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. 
(Ord. 403-97 § 2 (part), 1997) 
5.24.050 - Regulation of franchise. 
A.  Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable television system shall file an application with the city. A reasonable nonrefundable application fee established by the city shall accompany the application to cover all costs associated with processing and reviewing the application, including without limitation costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the applicant, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication requirements with respect to the consideration of the application and document preparation expenses. In the event such costs exceed the application fee, the selected applicant(s) shall pay the difference to the city within thirty days following receipt of an itemized statement of such costs. 
B.  An application for an initial franchise for a cable television system shall contain, where applicable: 
1.  A statement as to the proposed franchise and service area; 
2.  A resume of prior history of the applicant, including the expertise of applicant in the cable television field; 
3.  A list of the partners, general and limited, of the applicant, if a partnership, or of those owning or controlling over five percent of the stock, if a corporation; 
4.  A list of officers, directors and managing employees of the applicant, together with a description of the background of each such person; 
5.  The names and addresses of any parent or subsidiary of the applicant or any other business entity owning or controlling the applicant in whole or in part, or owned or controlled in whole or in part by the applicant; 
6.  The most recent financial statement of the applicant verified by a certified public accountant audit or otherwise certified to be true, complete and correct to the reasonable satisfaction of the city; 
7.  A proposed construction and service schedule; 
8.  Any reasonable additional information that the city deems applicable. 
C.  Consideration of Applications. 
1.  Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the city administrator shall prepare a report and make recommendations respecting such application to the council. 
2.  A public hearing shall be set and noticed prior to any initial franchise grant, at a time and date approved by the council. Within thirty days after the close of the hearing, the council shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or not the franchise(s) should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
D.  Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law. Grantor and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. If mutually agreed to in a franchise renewal agreement, grantee shall reimburse grantor for costs incidental to the franchise renewal award, not to exceed any maximum specified in the renewal agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to the grantor during the term of the franchise. 
E.  Minimum Consumer Protection and Service Standards. Grantee shall meet or exceed all consumer protections and service standards established by the Federal Communication Commission and as required under federal and state law. 
F.  Complaint Procedures. 
1.  Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. Grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with grantor. 
2.  Grantor shall have the right to review grantee's response to subscriber complaints in order to determine grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy. 
G.  Continuity of Service. 
1.  It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service so long as the franchise remains in force. 
2.  In the event of a change of control of grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with the grantor, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the original grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
3.  Except as reasonably necessary for system maintenance, construction, rebuild, or upgrade activity, grantee shall not intentionally terminate the ongoing operation of the cable system so as to deny cable service to its subscribers. Because the provision of cable service to subscribers is a unique service, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for violation of this subsection G. Grantor shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, as a remedy for violation of this subsection G. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy, but shall be in addition to any other remedy provided for in this chapter or the franchise agreement or at law or in equity. 
H.  Identification. All officers, agents or employees of grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers' premises shall carry a photo-identification card in a form reasonably approved by grantor. Grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of the grantee or its major subcontractors shall be clearly identified as working for grantee. 
I.  Additional Service Standards. Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement, and grantee shall comply with such standards in the operations of the cable television system. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that grantee shall receive due process, including written notification and an opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed. 
J.  Franchise Fee. 
1.  Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, the grantee shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement. 
2.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or under the franchise agreement, for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
3.  Franchise fee payment shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement. 
K.  Security Fund. 
1.  Grantor may require grantee to provide a security fund in an amount and form established in the franchise agreement or a guarantee by a corporate parent. The amount of any security fund shall be established based on the extent of the grantee's obligations under the terms of the franchise. 
2.  The security fund or guarantee shall be available to grantor to satisfy all claims, liens and/or taxes due grantor from grantee which arise by reason of construction, operation, or maintenance of the system, and to satisfy any actual or liquidated damages arising out of a franchise breach, subject to the procedures and amounts designated in the franchise agreement. 
3.  If the security fund is drawn upon by grantor in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount no later than thirty days after each withdrawal by grantor. Failure to replenish the security fund shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise. 
L.  Hold Harmless. Grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold grantor, its council, board, commissions, officers, agents and employees harmless from any liability, loss, claims, damages, costs or expenses, to the extent provided in the franchise agreement. 
M.  Insurance. 
1.  On or before commencement of franchise operations, the grantee shall obtain policies of liability, Workers' Compensation and property insurance from appropriately qualified insurance companies. 
2.  The policy of liability insurance shall: 
a.  Be issued to grantee and name grantor, its council, boards, commissions, officers, agents and employees as additional insureds; 
b.  Indemnify for all liability for personal and bodily injury, death and damage to property arising from activities conducted and premises used pursuant to this chapter by providing coverage therefor, including but not limited to: 
i.  Negligent acts or omissions of grantee, and its agents, servants and employees, committed in the conduct of franchise operations, and/or 
ii.  Use of motor vehicles; 
c.  Provide a combined single limit for comprehensive general liability and comprehensive automobile liability insurance in the amount provided for in the franchise agreement. Such insurance policy shall be noncancellable without thirty days' prior written notice thereof directed to grantor. 
3.  The policy of Workers' Compensation Insurance shall comply with the laws of the state of California. 
4.  The policy of property insurance shall provide fire insurance with extended coverage on the franchise property used by grantee in the conduct of franchise operations in an amount adequate to enable grantee to resume franchise operations following the occurrence of any risk covered by this insurance. 
5.  Grantee shall file with grantor prior to commencement of franchise operations a certificate of insurance for each of the required policies executed by the company issuing the policy or by a broker authorized to issue such a certificate, certifying that the policy is in force and providing the following information with respect to said policy: 
a.  The policy number; 
b.  The date upon which the policy will become effective and the date upon which it will expire; 
c.  The names of the named insureds and any additional insured required by the franchise agreement; 
d.  The subject of the insurance; 
e.  The type of coverage provided by the insurance; and 
f.  The amount or limit of coverage provided by the insurance. 
    If the certificate of insurance does not provide all of the above information, grantor reserves the right to inspect the relevant insurance policies. 
6.  Conduct of franchise operations shall not commence until grantee has complied with the aforementioned provisions of this subsection. 
7.  In the event grantee fails to maintain any of the above-described policies in full force and effect, grantor shall, upon forty-eight hours' notice to grantee, have the right to procure the required insurance and recover the cost thereof from grantee. Grantor shall also have the right to suspend the franchise during any period that grantee fails to maintain said policies in full force and effect. In order to account for increases in consumer prices, no more than once during any five-year period, grantor shall have the right to order grantee to increase the amounts of the insurance provided in the franchise agreement. Such order may be made by grantor at a regular city council meeting at which grantee has adequate notice and opportunity to address the issue. Increases in insurance coverage shall be based upon current prudent business practices of like enterprises involving the same or similar risks. 
N.  Records Required and Grantor's Right to Inspect. 
1.  Grantee shall at all times maintain: 
a.  A record of all service calls and interruptions or degradation of service experienced for the preceding two years, provided that such complaints result in or require a service call, subject to the subscriber's right of privacy. 
b.  A full and complete set of plans, records and "as-built" maps showing the locations of the cable television system installed or in use in the city, exclusive of subscriber service drops and equipment provided in subscriber's homes. 
c.  If requested by grantor, a summary of service calls, identifying the number, general nature and disposition of such calls, on a quarterly basis. A summary of such service calls shall be submitted to the grantor within thirty day following any grantor request, in a form reasonably acceptable to the grantor. 
2.  The grantor may impose reasonable requirements for additional information, records and documents from time to time, provided they reasonably relate to the scope of the city's rights under this chapter or the grantee's franchise agreement. 
3.  Upon reasonable notice, and during normal business hours, grantee shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative of the grantor of all franchise property and facilities, together with any appurtenant property and facilities of grantee situated within or without the city, and all records relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to enable the grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under this chapter or the franchise agreement. Grantee shall have the right to be present at any such examination. 
(Ord. 403-97 § 2 (part), 1997) 
5.24.060 - Design and construction requirements. 
A.  Grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until grantee has secured the necessary permits from grantor, or other cognizant public agencies. 
B.  In those areas of the city where transmission lines or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground. 
C.  In those areas of the city where the grantee's cables are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. 
D.  Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as "structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the streets, alleys and public ways shall be made only after grantee has secured all permits required therefor and under the direction of grantor's city engineer or a designee. The height above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the California Public Utilities Commission or other regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof. 
1.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the grantee shall be constructed and located so as not to interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places, and not to interfere with existing public utility installations. 
2.  In the event that any property or improvement of the grantor in the public rights-of-way is disturbed or damaged by the grantee or any of its contractors, agents or employees in connection with undertaking any and all work pursuant to the right granted to the grantee pursuant to this chapter, the grantee shall promptly, at the grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition said property or improvement which was so disturbed or damaged, and in the event that any such property or improvement shall at any later time become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require restoration, repair or replacement because of such disturbance or damage by the grantee, then the grantee shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from the grantor or otherwise and at the grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition said property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by the grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to time, be then provided for by grantor ordinance. 
3.  Prior to commencing any work in the public rights-of-way, the grantee shall obtain any and all permits lawfully required by such grantor codes and ordinances of general application for such work. In the event that emergency work may be required by the grantee, however, the grantee shall obtain any and all such permits within three working days after the beginning of such emergency work. 
4.  There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the public rights-of-way by the grantee in connection with any of the work herein provided for, and the grantee shall maintain such barriers, signs and warning signals during any such work performed on or about the public rights-of-way or adjacent thereto as may be required by applicable law and/or as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property. 
5.  If at any time during the period of this franchise the grantor shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location of any street, alley or other public rights-of-way, the grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by the grantor, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at it own expense, and in each instance shall comply with the requirements of the grantor. 
6.  The grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to comply with all ordinances of the grantor. 
7.  The grantee may be required by the grantor to permit joint use of its poles, conduits and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys or other public rights-of-way, by utilities insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefore; provided that in the absence of agreement regarding such joint use, the council shall provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint use and the compensation to be paid therefor, which award shall be final. 
8.  The grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the person requesting the same. The grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes, and may require payment in advance. 
9.  The grantee shall have the authority, except when in conflict with applicable grantor ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee, except that at the option of the grantor, such trimming may be done by grantor, or under grantor's supervision and direction. 
E.  In new residential developments in which the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground easements: 
1.  The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable service to that development. The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. 
2.  If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared cost basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee. 
3.  The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five working days after beginning installation to complete installation. 
4.  The final development map shall not be approved until the developer submits evidence that it has, or has agreed in the subdivision agreement, that it will: 
a.  Notify each grantee that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and 
b.  Receive a written notification from each grantee that the grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or receive no reply from a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the open trench period. 
5.  Share the joint utilities trench subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the developer and participating grantees. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and the grantees, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law. 
6.  Any grantee wishing to serve an area where the trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs. 
7.  In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the city may limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the grantee selected by the resident to provide service. 
8.  The city may grant an encroachment permit to a franchise applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant's risk, with no recourse against the city in the event the pending franchise application is not granted. The city may require an applicant to provide a separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant's cost. The construction of such separate trench, if provided, shall be coordinated with, and subject to, the developer's overall construction schedule. 
F.  Technical Standards. 
1.  The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with all applicable federal state and local laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, FCC technical standards, and any detailed standards set forth in its franchise agreement. In addition, the grantee shall provide to the grantor, a copy of all written reports of the results of the grantee's periodic proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to FCC and franchise standards and guidelines. 
2.  Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical standards shall constitute a material breach of the franchise.

1.  A summary of the previous year's (or in the case of the initial reporting year, the initial year's) activities in development of the cable system, including but not limited to, services begun or discontinued during the reporting year;

1.  Upon specific request, grantee shall submit to grantor copies of all pleadings, applications and reports submitted by grantee to, as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence and actions by, any federal, state or local court or regulatory agency, which are nonroutine in nature and which will materially affect its cable television operations within the franchise area. Information otherwise confidential by law and specifically designated as such by grantee, which is submitted to grantor, shall be retained in confidence by grantor and its authorized agents and shall not be made available for public inspection. In the event of legal challenge to grantor's withholding of any such information, grantee shall be responsible for defending against such challenge and shall indemnify grantor against any costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), losses, judgments or liabilities in connection therewith. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, grantee shall have no obligation to provide copies of documents to grantor which contain trade secrets of grantee or which are otherwise of a confidential or proprietary nature to grantee unless it receives satisfactory assurances from grantor that such information can and will be held in strictest confidence by the grantor. To the extent possible, grantee will provide grantor with summaries of any required documents or copies thereof with trade secrets and proprietary matters deleted therefrom. The burden of proof shall be on grantee to establish the confidential nature of any information submitted, to the reasonable satisfaction of the grantor.

4.  Any materially false or misleading statement or representation made knowingly and willfully by the grantee in any report required under this chapter or the franchise agreement may be deemed a material breach of the franchise and may subject grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to grantor under the franchise or otherwise.

5.24.080 - System evaluation. 
A.  Annual Review of System Performance. Each year throughout the term of the franchise, if requested by the grantor, grantor and grantee shall meet publicly to review system performance and quality of service. The various reports required pursuant to this chapter, results of technical performance tests, the record of subscriber complaints and grantee's response to complaints, and the information acquired in any subscriber surveys, shall be utilized as the basis for review. In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the review meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be considered. Within thirty days after the conclusion of a system performance review meeting, grantor may issue findings with respect to the cable system's franchise compliance and quality of service. If grantor determines that grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or the grantee's franchise, grantor may direct grantee to correct the areas of noncompliance within a reasonable period of time. Failure of grantee, after due notice, to correct the areas of noncompliance within the period specified therefor or to commence compliance within such period and diligently achieve compliance thereafter, shall be considered a material breach of the franchise, and grantor may exercise any remedy within the scope of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
B.  Special Review of System Performance. When there has been a pattern of complaints made or where there exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the grantor, casts reasonable doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service to the effect that the grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or its franchise, the grantor shall have the right to compel the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system in order to protect the public against substandard cable service. Grantor may not compel grantee to provide such tests or reports unless and until grantor has provided grantee with at least thirty days notice of its intention to exercise its rights under this section and has provided grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to its exercise of such rights. Such test or tests shall be made and the report shall be delivered to the grantor no later than thirty days after the grantor notifies the grantee that it is exercising such right, and shall be made at grantee's sole cost. Such report shall include the following information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests, what system component was tested, the equipment used and procedures employed in said testing, the results of such tests, and the method by which such complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the special test also shall be reported.

5.24.090 - Franchise breaches. 
A.  Remedies for Franchise Violations. If grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following notice from the grantor and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance in accordance with the provisions of subsection B of this section and the franchise, grantor may at its option and in its sole discretion: 
1.  Cure the violation and recover the actual cost thereof from the grantee and/or the security fund established herein if such violation is not cured within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of the violation; 
2.  Assess against and recover from grantee damages to the extent allowed by law for any such violations(s) if such violation is not cured, or (except where the violation is failure to pay any sum due) if grantee has not commenced a cure, on a schedule acceptable to grantor, within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of the violation. Such assessment may be withdrawn from any security fund, but such withdrawal shall not constitute a waiver by grantor of any right or remedy it may have under the franchise or applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including actual attorney's fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise. 
B.  Procedure for Remedying Franchise Violations. Prior to imposing any remedy or other sanction against grantee specified in this chapter or the franchise agreement, grantor shall give grantee notice and opportunity to be heard on the matter, in accordance with the following procedures: 
1.  Grantor shall first notify grantee of the violation in writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than five days in the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under this chapter or the grantee's franchise and thirty days in all other cases. If grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or (except where the violation is failure to pay any sum or other amount) if grantee fails to commence correction of the violation within the time prescribed and diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty days of a public hearing to be held before the council. Said notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred. 
2.  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision. 
3.  In the event the council finds that the grantee has corrected the violation or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
4.  In the event the council finds that a material violation exists and that grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the council may impose one or more of the remedies provided in this chapter or the franchise agreement as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances. 
C.  Grantor's Power to Revoke. Grantor reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and revoke all rights and privileges associated with it in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default by grantee and a material violation under the franchise: 
1.  If grantee shall default in the performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement and (except where the default is failure to pay any sum or other amount) shall continue such default after receipt of due notice and reasonable opportunity to cure the default; 
2.  If grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect any insurance coverage or security fund as required in this chapter or franchise agreement; 
3.  If grantee shall violate any order or ruling of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the grantee's franchise, unless such order or ruling is being contested by grantee by appropriate proceedings conducted in good faith; 
4.  If grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon grantor. 
    As provided for in Section 5.24.100 of this chapter, the termination and forfeiture of the grantee's franchise shall in no way affect any right of grantor to pursue any remedy under the franchise or any provision of law, including this chapter. 
D.  Force Majeure-Grantee's Inability to Perform. In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter or its franchise granted hereunder is prevented by a cause or event not within grantee's control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of grantee shall include acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency (other than the grantor acting pursuant to this chapter or the franchise agreement) or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires, and similar causes, but shall not include financial inability of the grantee to perform or failure of the grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of grantee, or the failure of the grantee to secure supplies, services or equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable communications system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure such supplies, services or equipment. 
(Ord. 403-97 § 2 (part), 1997) 
5.24.100 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.  Abandonment or Removal of Franchise Property. 
1.  In the event that the use of any franchise property of grantee within the public rights-of-way is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve months, grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property.

2.  Grantor, upon such terms as grantor may impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. 
3.  Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore any affected street or other public ways or public places to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were removed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all streets, public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments.

6.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or public rights-of-way or place in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other grantee. 
B.  Restoration by Grantor-Reimbursement of Costs. In the event of a failure by grantee to complete any work required herein or by any other law or ordinance, and if such work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of written notice thereof from grantor or (except in cases of emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare), if more than thirty days are reasonably required therefor, if grantee does not commence such work within such thirty days period and diligently complete the work thereafter, grantor may cause such work to be done and grantee shall reimburse grantor the costs thereof within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs. Without relieving grantee of such obligation, grantor may recover all or a portion of such costs through the security fund provided by grantee. 
C.  Extended Operation and Continuity of Services. Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall have the discretion to grant a short-term license in lieu of a franchise to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable television system for a specific period of time, not to exceed twelve months. Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the license and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time.

The grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. 
D.  Receivership and Foreclosure. 
1.  A franchise shall, at the option of grantor, cease and terminate one hundred twenty days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty days, or unless: (1) such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise, and the receivership or trustees within said one hundred twenty days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan, satisfactory to grantor, for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor; and (2) such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted. 
2.  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the franchise property, or any material part thereof, grantor may serve notice of termination upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such notice, unless: (1) grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner that this chapter provides; and (2) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.

2.  The grantor may waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
F.  Rights of Individuals. 
1.  Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex or sexual orientation.

4.  In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. Grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen. 
5.  No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment owned by the grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber's premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon subscriber's property shall be presumed. 
6.  The grantee and its agents and employees shall not sell or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber pursuant to state and federal privacy laws: 
a.  Any list containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; and 
b.  Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party. 
G.  Separability. If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect or for any other reason, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this Cable Ordinance, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation or otherwise invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee thirty days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision. 
H.  Notices. Grantee shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise, a local address for service of notices by mail.

Any such regulations not specifically set forth herein shall be promulgated by the appropriate officer and shall be effective when approved by the animal control director.

G.  Investigation. The animal control manager shall conduct such investigation of the background of the owner and the applicant and the history and physical condition of the kennel or cattery or keeping of the wild animal, including physical inspection of the premises, as is deemed appropriate.

A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the keeping of animals which are potentially dangerous or vicious or involve a threat to the safety of people and other animals on streets, sidewalks, and private property where the animals are not properly maintained as such animals constitute a serious hazard within the incorporated area of the city of Chowchilla. The increasing tendency to maintain dogs which, by virtue of breeding or training, have a propensity to attack others compounds the hazard. 
    Every owner of an animal is held strictly accountable for the exercise of such control over the animal as necessary to insure that the animal does not injure innocent human beings or other animals who are not on the premises where the animal is maintained. Such strict accountability is hereby imposed whether or not the injury results from the negligence or fault of the owner, and regardless of the degree of precaution or control exercised by the owner. 
B.  Owner Responsible. Any owner of any animal is deemed responsible for the acts committed by that animal when the owner has failed to comply with the legal requirements for the keeping of that animal as defined in this chapter. No person shall permit or suffer an animal to act in such a manner as constitutes dangerous or vicious behavior as defined in Sections 6.04.010(K) and 6.04.010(AB) of this chapter. 
    A violation of any of the provisions of this section is punishable as follows: 
1.  Any animal owner who maintains an animal in such a manner as to permit or suffer it to exhibit dangerous behavior shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
2.  Any animal owner who maintains any animal in such a manner as to permit or suffer it to exhibit vicious behavior shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
    Nothing in this section shall prevent prosecution for violations of other statutes or codes which may deal with other or more specific offenses, including but not limited to, penal and civil statutes. 
C.  Sale Prohibited. No animal held in custody by the animal control manager which is known to have exhibited dangerous or vicious behavior as defined in this chapter shall be released for sale to any member of the public, but rather shall be destroyed upon exhaustion of the required period of impoundment unless legally reclaimed by the owner. 
D.  Quarantine. No animal which has been declared dangerous or vicious or against which dangerous or vicious animal affidavit has been filed may be impounded or quarantined at any place other than the animal control center unless authorized by the animal control manager.

    All costs associated with these provisions or any other or additional provisions ordered by the hearing officer shall be borne by the owner of the animal which has been declared to be dangerous or vicious. 
L.  Mitigating Circumstances. In considering whether an animal is dangerous and/or vicious the hearing officer may hear and consider evidence of any of the following mitigating circumstances:

2.  That the animal was protecting or defending a person within the immediate vicinity of the animal from an unjustified attack or assault;

M.  Right to Destroy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the animal control manager from destroying an animal which is in the act of dangerous or vicious behavior towards any person or other animal as set forth in Sections 6.04.010(K) and 6.04.010(AB) of this chapter, if such immediate destruction is reasonably necessary to protect public safety.

If, after a period of two years from the date of the determination of the hearing officer that the animal is dangerous, vicious, or a nuisance, it can be demonstrated that the owner has complied with the order of the hearing officer and that no further cause exists for the order to stay in force, the owner may apply to the hearing officer, in writing, for relief from the conditions for keeping or the provisions for special registration of the animal. Upon investigation by the animal control manager and concurrence by the hearing officer, relief may be granted and the owner so notified in writing or a hearing may be conducted to determine if cause for relief exists.

1.  Well Inspected by Other Agencies. Inspections may be waived where the work will be inspected by the staff of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board or the California Department of Health Services if these designated agencies will inspect and report to the enforcement agency on all drilling features required by the standards. 
2.  Monitoring Wells under Specified Conditions. Inspections may be waived for monitoring wells that will penetrate only aquifers containing degraded waters or will penetrate only formations that normally contain no water. 
3.  Drilling Sites Known to Have No Threats to Groundwater Quality. Initial inspections may be waived when the drilling site is well known to the enforcement agency staff and it is known that no significant threats to groundwater quality exist in the area.

This report shall document that the work was completed in accordance with the standards and all additional permit conditions. 
    This section shall not be deemed to release any person from the requirement to file said report with the State Department of Water Resources. 
B.  Confidentiality of Report.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 466-13, § 2, adopted Oct. 22, 2013 , set out provisions intended for use as § 9.04.021. At the editor's discretion, to prevent duplication of section numbers, these provisions have been included as § 9.04.022. 
9.04.030 - Motor vehicle prohibitions-Exception-Purpose. 
A.  No person shall drive a motorcycle or motor-driven vehicle, as such vehicles are defined in the California Vehicle Code, including, but not limited to, motor scooters, motor-bikes, and minibikes, upon any property which is not a public street, or a private street approved by the city. 
B.  Exceptions. This section shall not apply where such vehicle is being driven upon property by the resident, regular occupant, or authorized visitor for the purposes of ingress or egress to such property. 
C.  Declaration Regarding Necessity for Section. This section is declared to be necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, peace and general welfare of the citizens of the city for the following reasons: 
1.  Noise emitted by motorcycles, motor-driven cycles and similar vehicles creates a substantial nuisance far in excess of other contributions to the normal noise level of the surrounding environment; 
2.  Such activity is primarily conducted as a recreational or leisure time pursuit, often by large numbers of drivers and passengers, and has no relationship to the economic use of the land or property being utilized by the owners; 
3.  Often such activity is a trespass upon private or public property; 
4.  Existence of such activity creates undue hardship on residents and citizens throughout the community due to excessive noise conditions; 
5.  Control of such activity through existing laws relating to trespass, nuisance, noise conditions, zoning and traffic are cumbersome, impractical and ineffective.

9.05 - CAMPING ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 

9.05.010 - Purpose. 
    The streets and public areas within the city should be readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended. Such activity can constitute a public health and safety hazard which adversely impacts neighborhoods and commercial areas. Camping on private property without the consent of the owner, proper sanitary measures, and for other than a minimal duration adversely affects private property rights as well as public health, safety, and welfare of the city. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain streets, parks and other public and private areas within the city in a clean, sanitary, and accessible condition and to adequately protect the health, safety, and public welfare of the community, while recognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping and camp facilities associated with special events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city. Nothing in this chapter is intended to interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary uses of public or private property.

13.12.050 - Sewer connection fees. 
    No permit shall be issued by the city unless the following charges, when applicable, have been paid: 
A.  Fees-Categories. 
1.  Oversize Sewer Charge. An oversize sewer charge shall be required for all lots sought to be connected to the city sewer system. The charge shall be either the minimum charge per lot, or the applicable rate per gross or net acre designated in the master fee resolution, whichever is greater. Area calculations shall be based upon the following:

b.  Property which has wholly or proportionately paid the cost of sewer mains, when such fact has been or can be established to the satisfaction of the city council, need pay only the oversize sewer charge applicable to the portion of the property for which the charge has not been paid. 
c.  When only a portion of a lot is developed, and the remaining is to continue undeveloped or is to be used solely for the growing of agricultural crops, or for public recreation uses not enclosed in a building, the city council may require the payment of the oversize sewer charge applicable only to that portion of the lot developed or to be developed; provided, that the parcel for which such fees are charged shall have an area of not less than twelve thousand five hundred square feet or one-fourth of the lot, whichever is greater. When the balance of the lot is developed, the oversize sewer charge shall be paid regardless of whether or not additional sewer service is required. The city administrator shall fix the portion of the lot which is to be considered as developed. 
2.  Major Facilities Sewer Charge. A major facilities sewer charge in the amount designated in the master fee resolution per unit shall be required for every lot sought to be connected to the city sewer system. However, for business uses which the city council determines will produce an unusually high strength or volume of waste, the major facilities sewer charge specified therein may be increased in direct proportion to the additional sewage treatment plant capacity or facilities required to treat same over and above that required to treat conventional wastewater. 
    Notwithstanding the above: 
a.  Where connection is to a lot which has been connected within the preceding twelve months or is currently connected to the city's sewage collection, treatment and disposal system, a credit equal to the major facilities sewer charge for the use attributed to said previous or current connection shall be made in determining the applicable major facilities sewer charge for the connection sought. 
b.  A lot located within the city limits of the city as of January 1, 1981, shall not be required to pay the major facilities sewer charge. 
c.  When only a portion of a lot is developed and the remaining portion is to continue undeveloped or is to be used solely for the growing of agricultural crops, the city administrator may require the payment of the major facilities sewer charge, applicable only to that portion of the lot developed or to be developed; provided, that the parcel for which such fees are charged shall have an area of not less than twelve thousand five hundred square feet or one-fourth of the lot, whichever is greater. When the balance of the lot is developed, the major facilities sewer charge on that portion shall be paid regardless of whether or not additional sewer service is required. The city administrator shall fix the portion of the lot which is to be considered as developed. 
d.  When a portion of a lot is developed and qualifies as open recreation and sport use, the city administrator may defer the payment of any major facilities sewer charge on the undeveloped portion of the lot until such time as development occurs. If such portion, or part thereof, is developed in a way that the development no longer qualifies for open recreation and sport use, the major facilities sewer charge shall be computed on the entire development on a full charge basis less any amount previously paid. 
    All lots, except those exempted by subparagraph b above, will be subject to the applicable major facilities sewer charge for each additional unit whenever such lot is developed to a higher density of units regardless of when connected. 
3.  Connection Charge. 
a.  For each connection to the city sewer system there shall be a charge as set forth in the master fee resolution. 
b.  Where connection is to an existing building sewer for which a connection charge has been previously paid, a credit equal to the previous connection classification be made in determining the applicable connection charge. Industrial classifications will be reviewed by the city engineer to determine what credit, if any, is applicable. All such credits will be on a current rate basis. 
B.  When land is subdivided, the owner, prior to the time the final map or parcel map is approved, shall pay or cause to be paid all applicable sewer connection fees; except, that the connection charge applicable to subdivision may be deferred, except for existing structures, and paid at any time prior to the issuance of a building permit for any structure to be constructed on such property. 
C.  Payment of charges and issuance of permits pursuant to this section does not authorize the permittee to perform or cause to be performed work specified in this chapter to be performed by the city. 
(Ord. 366-89 § 1, 1989: Ord. 324-81 § 4, 1981: Ord. 314-80 § 15, 1980: Ord. 260-76 § 5, 1976) 
13.12.055 - Payment of sewer charges. 
    The amount of any sewer connection charges prescribed under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owing to the city which, until paid, shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of the property for the connection of which the charge was incurred. Any person who makes a connection to the city sewer system without having paid such charges in full shall be liable in an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of such charge. The conviction or punishment of any person for connecting to the city sewer system without obtaining a permit shall not relieve such person from paying the charges due and unpaid at the time of such conviction. 
(Ord. 324-81 § 5, 1981) 
13.12.056 - Reimbursements. 
    When a sewer main installed by a person is required to be constructed to a size larger than required solely for such person's application or when sewer mains are installed that benefit property other than the property making contributions to the construction, the persons constructing such sewer mains or oversized sewer mains may request an agreement for reimbursement over a period not to exceed ten years from fees generated by connection of the noncontributing property. The cost eligible for inclusion shall be determined by the city council in its sole discretion and such decision shall be final. Cost may include, but is not limited to, interest during the life of the agreement. The city may cause the cost of preparation of such agreement to be prepaid. The persons requesting such agreement shall provide to the city the cost information required to prepare such an agreement and deposit the amount established by the city administrator to cover the cost of preparing said agreement.

If the addition as requested is found to be feasible by the city administrator, such addition may be made to the city sewer system in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The person making the addition shall cause the installation of such addition to conform in all respects with the standard specifications for sewer facilities of the city, with applicable health laws, and with the lines and grades designated by the city. 
B.  If a right-of-way is needed for an addition to the city sewer system, the person constructing the addition shall obtain such right-of-way for the city, or pay the cost to the city of acquiring such right-of-way. If the city council determines that a pump station is necessary to serve the property of the person installing the sewer, such person shall install a pump station meeting specifications approved by the city council and shall pay the full cost of such installation. 
C.  When new, enlarged or additional sewer service is required to serve a property, mains shall be installed across the full frontages of the property unless the city council determines that mains are not required at that time across the full frontage to serve other properties or because an undeveloped portion of the subject property does not require sewer service. Where a property has more than one frontage on which main installation would be required by this section, the city council may require payment of frontage charges in lieu of main installation along such additional frontages. Frontage charges collected pursuant to this section shall be deemed as reimbursable pursuant to Section 13.12.056. 
D.  Specifications and plans for the installation of additions to the city sewer system shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer and shall be approved by the city engineer before a permit for doing the work may be issued. 
E.  When a sewer main has been installed in public streets or easements pursuant to the regulations of the city and has been accepted by the city administrator, then the sewer shall become the property of the city and a part of the city sewer system. House branch sewer, including their connection to sewer mains, shall not be considered as city property or become a part of the city sewer system, and their maintenance and repair shall not be provided by the city. 
F.  Although it is the intent of the chapter that arrangements necessary to install sewer mains required to serve property will be the responsibility of the person desiring such service, an exception is necessary to facilitate minor additions to the system. The city may, upon written request of the applicant, take all steps necessary to complete the total installation subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Total of front footage for which lateral sewer charges would be payable if mains existed plus off-site main required is three hundred feet or less. 
2.  Applicant pays the oversize sewage charge, the major facilities sewer charge for his property, and the connection charge for his property as though sewer mains already existed on the property frontage. 
3.  Applicant pays to the city for each foot of main installed to cover the cost of design, surveying, inspection, and testing. 
G.  Connections to mains in other than dedicated and surfaced streets or alleys shall not be permitted where service can be rendered from dedicated and surfaced streets or alleys by extension or otherwise.

13.16.040 - Charges, bills and payment for municipal utility services. 
A.  Charges. Charges for municipal utility services, fiscal service charges, and minimum charges shall be in the amounts designated by resolution of the city council. Any delinquent charges and penalties thereon shall be recorded and shall constitute a lien upon the real property served. The lien shall continue until the charge and all penalties thereon are fully paid or the property sold. 
B.  Applicant's Responsibility. No municipal utility services shall be provided without an application by the owner of the premises to be served or the authorized agent of the owner. Any person in lawful possession of the premises shall be deemed to be the agent of the owner. Billings for service will be to the owner unless otherwise provided on the application, but the municipal utility services are to the premises and the owner thereof is responsible. The application shall signify the applicant's willingness and intention to comply with this and other ordinances or regulations relating to the regular municipal utility services and to make payment for the services. 
C.  Due and Delinquency Dates. The minimum guidelines are: 
1.  Bills for flat rate utility services will be rendered at the conclusion of the service period designated in any such bill. 
2.  Bills for metered service will be rendered as soon as practicable after the reading of the meter. 
3.  Bills for municipal utility services shall be due and payable nineteen days from the date of depositing the bill for services in the United States mail or upon presentation to the customer. 
4.  Bills for municipal utility services shall become overdue and delinquent when payment is not made by the date specified thereon at the close of business hours. The date specified thereon shall be at least nineteen days after the Post Office cancellation date for the billing. 
5.  In the absence of a specified date, rates and charges which are not paid within nineteen days after the Post Office cancellation date of the billing shall be subject to a basic penalty of ten percent. In addition a penalty of one-half of one percent per month shall be added to the bill for every month of nonpayment for the charges and penalties. Service may be discontinued until payment is made in full. If due date falls on a weekend or holiday, payment is due on the next working day. 
D.  Municipal Service Bills. The city shall have the power to combine bills for utility services rendered to any one customer or bill separately therefor, as in the city's discretion it may deem to be in the best interests of the city. The city shall have the power to bill for regular service or special services rendered to regular service customers or consumers, upon a monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or other basis, as in its discretion it may deem to be in the best interest of the city. For billings periods other than monthly, the charge for flat rate service will be computed by multiplying the monthly charge by the number of months in the billing period. 
E.  Payments. 
1.  Place of Payment. Bills are payable at the office of the city, 145 Robertson Boulevard, Chowchilla, California, or to an authorized city collector or city collection agent. 
2.  Credit to Account. Payments shall be credited to a customer's account only when actually received by an employee of the city in the utility billing department or such collector or collection agent. Payments shall be received "on account" of the customer and shall not apply to charges for any particular period. 
3.  Checks. If a remittance tendered in payment of any account fails to clear through the banks and is returned, the account shall be considered unpaid, any receipts issued therefor shall be void, and the indebtedness shall be restored to the account. 
4.  Service Charge for Returned Checks. The service charge for returned checks designated in the city resolution on rates and charges for utility services shall be assessed when the check or other commercial paper fails to clear through the banks and is returned to the city. This charge shall be made against the account originally credited, shall be added to the amount of the bill, and shall become a part thereof. This charge is in addition to any collection, restoration or reconnection charges which may otherwise become due and payable. Assessment of this service charge shall not relieve the maker of any criminal or civil liability provided by law. 
F.  Proration of Bills. The charges applicable to opening periods and closing bills rendered for periods less than the regular billing cycle will be computed as follows: 
1.  Metered Service. The amount of the minimum charge (and the quantity allowed therefor) or the readiness to serve charge will be prorated on the basis of the ratio of the number of days in the period to the number of days in the established billing period. The measured quantity of usage will be applied to such prorated amounts and quantities. In general, meters shall be read on a monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or other basis. The period between reading dates may vary and still be considered as one or more whole amounts for billing purposes. 
2.  Flat Rate Service. The billing period charge will be prorated on the basis of the ratio of the number of days in the period to the number of days in the established billing period. 
3.  Established Billing Period. The number of days in billing periods will be considered as thirty days for those accounts on a monthly cycle, as sixty days for those accounts on a bimonthly cycle, and as ninety days for those accounts on a quarterly cycle. 
4.  Rounding Off. Any flat rate charge may be rounded off to the nearest multiple of five cents. Charges based on volume may be rounded off only to the nearest multiple of one cent. Parcel size may be rounded off to the nearest one hundred square feet. 
G.  Disputed Bills. Should the amount of any bill for service be questioned, the customer should promptly request an explanation. If the explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the customer must initiate a complaint or request an investigation within five days of receiving the dispute bill, or within thirteen days of mailing of the notice required by Section 13.16.060(D) of this chapter, make a request for extension of the payment period of a bill asserted to be beyond the means of the customer to pay in full during the normal period for payment. The review shall include consideration of whether the customer shall be permitted to amortize the unpaid balance of the account over a reasonable period of time, not to exceed twelve months. No termination of service shall be initiated for any customer during the pendency of an investigation by the city of a customer dispute or for any customer complying with the amortization agreement, if the customer also keeps the account current as charges accrued in each subsequent billing period. 
    Any customer whose complaint or request for an investigation pursuant to the above has resulted in an adverse determination by the city administrator may appeal the determination to the city council. 
H.  Failure to Receive Bills. Municipal service bills shall be mailed to the premises served and/or other address known to the city. The applicant, property owner, or his authorized agency may list a mailing address with the city for use in mailing bills. Failure to request such listing or to receive any bill, invoice, or notice shall not relieve responsibility for timely payment as required. 
I.  Computation When Meter Cannot Be Read. Whenever for any reason a meter is inaccessible and cannot be read or fails to register, water consumption at the metered premises for the purpose of calculating charges based thereon shall be estimated by one or more of the following methods as the city may deem to be the best indicators of actual water consumed or actual charges due: 
1.  Previous actual consumption at said premises as shown by previous meter readings; 
2.  Previous average actual consumption for corresponding billing periods in previous years during which the meter is known to have registered correctly; 
3.  Consumption as registered by a later substituted meter; 
4.  Consumption based upon the nature of use, volume of business, seasonal demand, and similar factors that may indicate consumption. 
    Where a meter cannot be read without undue difficulty because of an obstruction, the customer will be notified and requested to correct the condition. The city has the right to discontinue the service if the condition is not corrected. Where service is turned off for such cause, the city may require payment of a turn-on charge as provided for in this chapter. 
(Ord. 407-98 § 1 (part), 1998) 
13.16.050 - Establishment of credit for municipal utility services. 
A.  Master-Metered Apartment Buildings, Commercial and Industrial Accounts. An applicant for any utility service for a master-metered apartment building, commercial or industrial establishment or for any measured or metered water service shall establish his credit to the satisfaction of the city. An applicant's credit will be deemed to be established if the applicant: 
1.  Subject to amount determination as hereinafter provided, makes a cash deposit with the city or makes an assignment to the city of a saving and loan certificate or passbook, or a commercial bank savings or time deposit certificate, or furnished a two-party guaranty or corporate surety bond satisfactory to the city administrator to secure the payment of charges for municipal utility services;

4.  Has previously been a utility service customer of the city within one year of the application for service and has paid all bills promptly for the last twelve-month period prior to the date of the discontinuance of service. 
B.  Residential and Tenant Accounts. A residential or tenant applicant may be required to deposit a sum of money with the city prior to establishing an account and furnishing service. The decision to require a deposit shall be based solely upon the credit worthiness of the applicant as determined by the city. In determining the credit worthiness of an applicant, the city may consider the credit history of the applicant for the past three years, and shall not discriminate based on the location of the premises or on the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry of the applicant. 
C.  Amount of Security. Service deposits, bonds or other security when furnished by a residential customer to guarantee payment of utility bills, shall be made in an amount not to exceed twice the estimated average periodic bill or three times the estimated average monthly bill. 
D.  Return of Security. If a residential customer's account has not been delinquent in twelve consecutive months, any service deposit or other security for said account shall be returned to the depositor upon application for refund of said security. If a customer who has established credit, or whose deposit has been returned as provided herein, fails to pay his bill promptly as required under this chapter, the city may demand as a condition precedent to further service and as security for the payment of bills thereafter to be incurred, security in the maximum amounts set forth in subsection C of this section. 
E.  Closing of Account. The balance of the security of any account remaining after the closing bill for service has been paid, and less any city offsets, shall be returned to the customer. No interest shall be paid by the city on any such balance. In the event the customer fails to leave a forwarding address, and no such address is received in one year, said balance shall be forfeited to the city. 
F.  In no event shall the city seek to recover any charges or penalties for the residential use to a tenant under an account established by a tenant for the furnishing of services to or for the tenant's residential use from any subsequent tenant or the property owner due to nonpayment of charges by a previous tenant. "Subsequent tenant" shall not include any adult person who lived at the residence during the period that the charges or penalties accrued. The city will not require that service to subsequent tenants be furnished on the account of the landlord or property owner unless the property owner consents through a written agreement.

(Ord. 407-98 § 1 (part), 1998) 
13.16.070 - Municipal utility service payment agreements.

(Ord. 407-98 § 1 (part), 1998) 
13.16.120 - Limitation on terminating service.

Chapter 13.20 - COLLECTION PROCEDURES FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES OTHER THAN UTILITY SERVICES, PLANNING SERVICES, TAXES AND FINES

(Ord. 371-90 § 3, 1990) 
Chapter 13.24 - STORM DRAINAGE ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT 

13.24.010 - Establishment of enterprise account. 
    There is established a storm drainage enterprise account to be kept separate and apart from the general fund of the city, or any other special account of the city. All storm drainage fees collected pursuant to this chapter, by the city shall be deposited into the enterprise account. All costs the payment of which were used to calculate the amount of the storm drainage fee, shall be paid out of the storm drainage enterprise account. The storm drainage enterprise account funds shall not be used to pay any costs other than the costs which are directly related to the city providing storm drainage services, as described in this chapter. 
(Ord. 388-95 § 2 (part), 1995) 
13.24.020 - Storm drainage fees-Purpose and amount. 
    There is established a storm drainage fee. The amount of the fee shall be established by the city council and modified from time to time thereafter, by resolution. The amount of the fee shall be determined by the council based on the council's findings of the actual cost of providing stormwater drainage services to properties within the city. 
A.  The calculation of the actual cost may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the cost of each of the following: the construction of any storm drainage ponding basins constructed by the city, including but not limited to the debt service payment for any debt incurred for this purpose; the cost of the maintenance of any storm drainage ponding basin which the city owns and operates and into which stormwater drains from property within the city limits; the cost of the construction, acquisition, operation and maintenance of any and all other storm drainage facilities, including but not limited to any administrative, master planning engineering and design work associated with them and the cost of any appurtenances to such facilities such as drains, ditches, pipes, pumps, gutters, and fencing and landscaping in, along, over or within any storm drainage basins owned, operated or maintained by the city. 
B.  The method of determining charges shall take into account the square footage of the property and the allowable use of the land, because use indicates the likely percentage of surface area of the land available for the percolation of stormwaters. 
(Ord. 388-95 § 2 (part), 1995) 
13.24.030 - Storm drainage fees-When payable. 
    The city shall cause the owner of each developed property within the city, which is not exempt from this charge, periodically to be sent a statement for storm drainage fees and collection of those fees shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13.16 of this code, however storm drainage services cannot be terminated by a property owner unless and until that property owner either ceases to own the property or brings that property within one or more of the exemptions to the storm drainage fee set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 388-95 § 2 (part), 1995) 
13.24.040 - Exemptions. 
    It is not fair or reasonable for certain types of properties to be billed for the stormwater fee and it is found and determined that those properties should be exempt from the fee. 
A.  Because industrial or manufacturing properties in the city which are zoned for heavy industrial use, (under Chapter 18.42 of this code,) are required to construct and maintain their own storm drainage facilities and to dispose of all storm drainage waters which run off of their own property thereby, this fee is specifically made inapplicable to properties which are zoned for such purposes. However, property which is zoned for light industrial use, (under Chapter 18.41 of this code,) is not required to construct or maintain their own storm drainage facilities or to dispose of all storm drainage waters which run off of their own property and, therefore, such property is not exempt from the fee charged pursuant to this chapter. 
B.  Because certain land, from time to time, has been and will be annexed into the city which is in an agricultural use and if allowed to remain in that use after annexation then all land in agricultural uses and which is appropriately zoned for such purpose is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter. 
C.  Because land which has never been developed, typically is not paved and does not have upon it any building or structure which is impenetrable to water, such land, as a general rule, does not cause stormwater run off but, in fact, serves to help provide open land in which stormwaters may gather and percolate into the ground, such land is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter. 
D.  Because the owner of a single parcel of land should not be compelled to pay twice for the same services, all land which is in a landscape and lighting maintenance district of the city, for any fiscal year in which the landscape and lighting maintenance district has established its budget so as to include the cost of operating and maintaining storm drainage collection, retention or disposal facilities, is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter. However, such exemption shall cease at the beginning of any fiscal year in which the budget adopted for the landscape and lighting maintenance district does not include the full cost of maintaining the stormwater facilities which serve the property within that district. 
E.  Because land owned by the city would simply pay the fee out of the enterprise fund itself, it would make no sense for the city to have to pay itself such a fee. Therefore all land owned by the city is exempt from the payment of the fee.

Chapter 14.08 - AIRPORT/AIRSPACE ZONING 
Sections: 

14.08.010 - City council findings. 
    It is found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of Chowchilla Airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Chowchilla Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: 
A.  That the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by Chowchilla Airport; 
B.  That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and 
C.  That the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

14.08.040 - Zones established and designated. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are created and established certain zones, which include some of the space above land lying within the approach zone, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone. Such spaces and zones are shown on the Chowchilla Airport/Airspace Zoning Map, consisting of one sheet prepared by the Madera County Planning Department and dated October 31, 1969, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
A.  Approach Zone. An approach zone is established at each end of all runways on Chowchilla Airport for landings and take-offs. The approach zone shall have a width of two hundred feet at each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand feet at a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
B.  Transition Zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line one hundred feet on either side of the centerline of the runway, for the length of such runway, plus two hundred feet on each end. The transition zones along such runway slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones, and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. 
C.  Horizontal Zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of five thousand feet. The horizontal zone does not include the approach zones and the transition zones. 
D.  Conical Zone. A conical zone is hereby established commencing at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extending to a distance of eight thousand feet from the airport reference point. The conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 17, 1969) 
14.08.050 - Height limitations in designated zones. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established in this section for such zone. Such height limitations are computed from the established airport elevation, and are established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
1.  Approach Zones. One foot in height for each twenty feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred feet from the end of the runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway; 
2.  Transition Zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point one hundred feet from the centerline of runway measured at right angles to the longitudinal centerline of the runway, and extending upward to a maximum height of one hundred fifty feet above the established airport elevation, which is two hundred thirty-nine feet (highest point of usable landing area) above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance, measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones, and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces; 
3.  Horizontal Zone. One hundred fifty feet above the established airport elevation or a maximum height of three hundred eighty-nine feet above mean sea level elevation; 
4.  Conical Zone. One foot in height for each twenty feet of horizontal distance, beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and measured in an inclined plane passing through the airport reference point. 
B.  Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 18, 1969) 
14.08.060 - Additional land use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 19, 1969) 
14.08.070 - Nonconforming uses-Regulations not retroactive. 
    The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and which is diligently prosecuted. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 20(a), 1969)

Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
1.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the grounds except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone. 
2.  In the areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zone. 
3.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
B.  Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter, except as set forth in Section 14.08.050. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 21 (a), 1969) 
14.08.100 - Existing uses-Permit restrictions. 
    No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 21(b), 1969) 
14.08.110 - Hazard marking and lighting. 
    Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city, at its own expense to install, operate and maintain thereon or adjacent, such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 21(e) , 1969) 
14.08.120 - Nonconforming uses-Procedure when abandoned or destroyed. 
    Whenever the planning commission determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 21(c), 1969) 
14.08.130 - Variances. 
    Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the planning commission for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. 
(Ord. 218-69 § 21(d), 1969) 
14.08.140 - Rules and regulations relating to the municipal airport and airport facilities.

A.  A preliminary soil report shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the state, based upon test borings or excavations unless waived as provided in this title. The borings or excavations shall be taken at specific locations determined by the city engineer or at random locations if no specific locations are established. Not less than one test shall be made for every forty lots or ten acres, whichever represents the lesser area, and in no case shall there be less than two borings for each subdivision. The city engineer may require additional tests when he determines the soil conditions within the subdivision are so varied that additional tests will be needed. If the city engineer has knowledge of the soil qualities of the subdivision, he may waive some or all of the borings. The borings shall be at least ten feet in depth. The depth of borings shall be adjusted to represent soil profiles after any proposed lot grading and shall take into consideration the soil composition after excavations, fills and embankments have been completed. The preliminary soil report shall contain the following information: 
1.  The maximum amount of excavation and fill to be expected; 
2.  The location of foundations in relation to excavations and fills; 
3.  The expansive qualities of the soils encountered where foundations are to be placed thereon and shall state the percentage of swell of a soil section taken from a representative undisturbed core sample under a load of six hundred twenty-five [pounds] per square foot, laterally restrained, saturated and allowed to swell. If footings are to be placed in fills, the expansive tests shall be performed under a load of six hundred twenty-five pounds per square foot, laterally restrained and compacted to ninety percent of maximum density with the moisture content below the shrinkage limit. The percentage of expansion shall be recorded after twenty-four hours. If the swell of the sample exceeds three percent, it shall be presumed that the soil involved is critically expansive and a soil investigation as required in subsection B of this section will be required; 
4.  Recommended bearing values for the soils; 
5.  Whether other soil problems exist which, if not corrected, could lead to structural defects; 
6.  Copies of the test boring analysis. Water well drilling logs shall not be substituted. 
7.  R-values for pavement design. 
B.  If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils, or other soils or fills would be of such depth that foundations will not rest on original ground, a soil investigation shall be prepared for each lot in the subdivision by a civil engineer who is registered by the state. The soil investigation report shall include the following: 
1.  The physical properties of subsurface formations; 
2.  The composition of subsurface soil and rock and groundwater conditions; 
3.  The stability of anticipated cut or fill slopes; 
4.  The general type of site grading; 
5.  Recommendations on corrective actions which are likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed. These recommendations may include the requirement that the corrective work must be under the supervision of a registered civil engineer. 
    The soil investigation shall be reviewed by the city engineer who shall approve the investigation if he determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed. 
C.  Waiver of Soil Report. The city engineer may waive the preliminary soil report if he has knowledge of the soil qualities within the subdivision. 
D.  Approval Where Soils Problem Exists. The council may approve the subdivision or portion thereof where soils problems exist if it determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed, and as a condition to the issuance of any building permit, may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure. 
E.  Notice of Soil or Geologic Report. When a soil report, a geologic report, or soil and geologic report have been prepared specifically for the subdivision, such fact shall be noted on the final map, together with the date of such report or reports, the name of the engineer making the soil report and geologist making the geologic report and a statement indicating that the reports are on file for public inspection with the city clerk.

A.  The parcel map shall be prepared by or under direction of a registered civil engineer or licensed surveyor. 
B.  It shall be a map legibly drawn, printed, or reproduced by a process guaranteeing a permanent record in black on tracing cloth or polyester base film including certificates, except that such certificates may be legibly stamped or printed upon the map with opaque ink. If ink is used on polyester base film, the ink surface shall be coated with a suitable substance to assure permanent legibility; 
C.  The size of each sheet shall be eighteen by twenty-six inches. A marginal line shall be drawn completely around each sheet leaving an entirely blank margin of one inch. 
D.  The scale of the map shall be no greater than one inch equals one hundred feet; except that subdivisions with lots of two and one-half acres or greater may use a scale of one inch equals two hundred feet. The city engineer may require one inch equals fifty feet if complexity of detail so warrants. 
E.  When the parcel map consists of more than two sheets, a key map drawn to a scale shall be placed on sheet number one indicating the relationship among all sheets. The particular number of each sheet and the total number of sheets comprising the map shall be stated on each of the sheets, and its relation to each adjoining sheet shall be clearly shown. 
F.  The title of each parcel map shall consist of a parcel map number conspicuously placed on the sheet followed by the words "consisting of...sheets" (showing the number thereof) followed by the words "In the City of Chowchilla." There shall appear a description of all the property being subdivided, by reference to such map or maps of the property shown thereon as previously recorded or filed in the county recorder's office or previously recorded or filed with the county recorder pursuant to a final judgment in any action in partition, or previously filed in the office of the county recorder under authority of Chapter 3, Part 2 of Division 4 of the Business and Professions Code, or by reference to the plat of any United States Survey. Each reference, in such description, to any tract or subdivision shall be spelled out and worded identically with the original records thereof and must show a complete reference to the book and page of records of the county recorder. The description shall also include reference to any abandonment with the date, book, and page of records of the county recorder. 
G.  The exterior boundary of the land included within the subdivision shall be indicated by distinctive line and clearly so designated. The map shall show the location of each parcel and its relation to surrounding surveys. The location of any remainder of the original parcel shall be shown. If such remainder has a gross area of five acres or more, it need not be shown as a matter of survey, but only by reference to the existing record boundaries of such remainder. 
H.  A lot shall be shown in its entirety on one sheet. The parcel map shall particularly define, delineate and designate all parcels intended to be reserved for private purposes, all parcels offered for dedication for any purpose, and any private roads, with all dimensions, boundaries and courses clearly shown and defined in every case. Parcels offered for dedication other than for roads, alleys, pedestrian walkways, water lots, or easements shall be designated. The parcels shall be numbered consecutively and shall continue without omission or duplication throughout the entire subdivision. Each parcel containing an area of one acre or more, excluding public easements of record, shall have designated thereon the net acreage of such lot shown not less accurately than to the nearest one-hundredth of an acre. 
I.  Certificates and acknowledgments as are required by the Subdivision Map Act shall appear on the title sheet of the parcel map, unless their omission is permitted in the manner provided by the Subdivision Map Act.

However, with respect to a division of land into four or fewer parcels, where dedications or offers of dedications are not required, the certificate shall be signed and acknowledged by the subdivider only; provided, however, where a subdivider does not have a record title ownership interest in the property to be divided, the subdivider shall provide the city clerk with satisfactory evidence that the persons with record title ownership have consented to the proposed division. For purposes of this section, "record title ownership" means fee title of record unless a leasehold interest is to be divided, in which case record title ownership means ownership of record of such leasehold interest; record title ownership does not include ownership of mineral rights or other subsurface interests which have been severed from ownership of the surface. 
K.  A certificate for the city clerk shall be required where dedications are offered and shall certify the action of the council to accept or reject the proposed dedications. 
L.  Evidence of title, acceptable to the county recorder, shall be secured from a title company indicating that, as shown by public records, the parties whose signatures appear on the map and consent to the recordation of the map are all the parties having a record title interest in the land being subdivided whose signatures are required by the Subdivision Map Act.

Chapter 17.40 - FEES AND SECURITY 
Sections: 

17.40.010 - Park and recreation fees. 
A.  Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code of the state. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this section are in accordance with the recreation element of the general plan. 
B.  Condition of Approval. As a condition of approval of a final map, parcel map or parcel map waiver certificate, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this section. 
C.  General Standard. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that four acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within this city be devoted to local public park and recreational purposes. 
D.  Standards and Formula for Dedication of Land. 
1.  Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the open space, recreation and conservation plan, an element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision. 
2.  The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following standards and formula: 
Density Formula 
Net density per dwelling unit Percentage of the gross area of the subdivision required when park land is dedicated 1 D.U. per acre or more 0.60% 1 D.U. per 1/2 to 1 acre 1.20% 1 D.U. per 10,000 sq. ft. to 1/2 acre 1.73% 1 D.U. per 9,000 to 9,999 sq. ft. 2.70% 1 D.U. per 8,000 to 8,999 sq. ft. 3.01% 1 D.U. per 7,000 to 7,999 sq. ft. 3.40% 1 D.U. per 6,000 to 6,999 sq. ft. 3.90% 1 D.U. per 5,999 sq. ft. to 19 D.U.'s per acre 5.79% 20 to 29 D.U.'s per acre 9.30% 30 to 39 D.U.'s per acre 12.56% 40 or more D.U.'s per acre 15.58%  
E.  Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication. 
1.  General Formula. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the city open space, recreation and conservation plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in subsection D of this section and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection F of this section, such fee to be used for a local park which will serve the residents of the area being subdivided. 
2.  Fees in Lieu of Land-Fifty Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in subsection D of this section and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection F of this section. 
F.  Amount of Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication. Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be determined in the following manner: 
1.  The subdivider shall request that an appraisal be prepared pursuant to the procedures set forth below and shall pay the in-lieu fee based upon the fair market value established in that appraisal. 
2.  Upon request of the subdivider, the city shall cause an appraisal to be made. The appraisal shall be made at the subdivider's expense, payable to the city in advance, by a person on the city's list of approved appraisers, who will be qualified as a certified general real estate appraiser by the California Office of Real Estate Appraisers and shall meet the standards specified in the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice. The appraiser shall appraise the property at its unencumbered (free and clear) value, as if at the approved tentative map stage of development and as if any assessments or other encumbrances to which the property is subject had been paid off in full prior to the date of appraisal. Factors to be considered during the evaluation shall include the following: 
a.  Conditions of the tentative map; 
b.  The general plan; 
c.  Zoning and density; 
d.  Property location; 
e.  Off-site improvements facilitating use of the property; 
f.  Site characteristics of the property; 
g.  Existing public improvements. 
3.  The appraisal shall value the property as of a date no earlier than ninety days prior to the recording of the final map, or the payment of the fee, whichever occurs later. The appraisal shall clearly state the fair market value of the property. 
4.  Alternatively, the subdivider may disclose to the city the market price paid for the land if the land has been purchased in the past one year, and the city has the option of accepting that price as the basis for an in-lieu fee. 
G.  Subdivisions Not Within the General Plan. Where the proposed subdivision lies within an area not then but to be included within the general plan, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, in accordance with the adopted park and recreational principles and standards of the general plan and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
H.  Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the council accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
1.  Recreational element of the general plan; 
2.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
3.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
4.  The feasibility of dedication; 
5.  Compatibility of dedication with the city park, recreation and conservation plan; and 
6.  Availability of previously acquired park property. The determination of the council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof shall be final and conclusive. 
I.  Credit for Private Open Space. Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed fifty percent, may be given against the requirements of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met: 
1.  That yards, court areas, setbacks and other areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
2.  That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or restrictions; and 
3.  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; and 
4.  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and 
5.  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the general plan. 
J.  Procedure. At the time of approval of the tentative subdivision map, the council shall determine, pursuant to subsection H of this section, the land to be dedicated and/or fees to be paid by the subdivider. At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land or pay the fees as previously determined by the council. Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final subdivision map. 
K.  Commencement of Development. At the time of approval of the final subdivision map, the council shall specify how and when it will use the land or fees or both to develop park or recreational facilities. Any fees collected under this title shall be committed within five years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such fees are not committed, they shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. 
L.  Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes; provided, however, that a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. The provisions of this section shall not apply to industrial subdivisions; nor to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added; nor to parcel maps for a subdivision containing less than five parcels for a shopping center containing more than three hundred thousand square feet of gross leasable area and no residential development or uses.

Chapter 17.68 - DEVELOPMENT FEES FOR THE REALIGNMENT OF CHOWCHILLA BOULEVARD AND ROBERTSON BOULEVARD 
Sections: 

17.68.010 - Applicability of chapter. 
    The fees established by this chapter shall apply to an applicant for approval of a site plan or a tentative subdivision map or a building permit for any development project which is constructed on the benefitted properties. The council has determined that certain properties which are within the city limits are benefitted by the improvements described in this chapter, and when those properties develop, the owners of those benefitted properties would normally be required to construct the improvements described herein. These benefitted properties, on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter bear the following assessor's parcel numbers: 02-060-03(W), 02-060-03(E), 02-060-04(W), 02-060-04(E), 02-060-05 and 02-120-01. It is recognized that the last property mentioned parcel is benefitted only as to the storm drainage improvements and should share in only the cost of the storm drainage improvements. The fees established by this chapter shall apply to any approval of any development project on the benefitted properties, whether or not the owners at the time of the application for a building permit are the current owners of the property. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.68.020 - Findings. 
A.  The purpose of the fees set forth in this chapter is to reimburse the city for the costs of constructing certain public improvements, including but not limited to streets (including but not necessarily limited to street paving, sidewalks, and street lights), sewer mains, water mains, storm water drainage and other related improvements, in the realignment of the southern intersection of Chowchilla Boulevard and Robertson Boulevard. A fair and just cost distribution between the benefitted properties for each of these improvements would be to base the distribution upon net acreage of each of the properties. 
B.  Such fees shall be used to reimburse the city's enterprise funds' capital accounts for the cost incurred by the city in constructing the public improvements and shall be used by the city in conformity with the limitations placed upon those accounts. 
C.  There is a reasonable relationship between the purpose of these fees and the benefitted properties because the benefitted properties will benefit from the public improvements and the development of the benefitted properties would necessitate the construction of these public improvements at that time. 
D.  The size of the fees shall be determined by the council by resolution. No such fee shall be set unless it is determined by the council to bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the public facilities attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed. Each such resolution which sets the amount of the fees shall identify the public improvement for which the fee is charged and the method of determining the amount of the fee. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.68.030 - Payment of fees a requirement for any site plan, tentative subdivision map or building permit approval. 
    No site plan shall by approved for any of the benefitted properties, no tentative subdivision map shall be approved for any of the benefitted properties and no building permit shall be issued for any construction on any of the benefitted properties without the payment of all sums required by this chapter. Each of the benefitted properties shall be assessed for a proportional share of the costs to the city of constructing the public improvements. The proportion shall be determined by the council by resolution but shall be based on the level of benefit which the council determines is applicable to that parcel of benefitted property compared to the level of benefit received by the other benefitted properties. The council may determine that each of the parcels are benefitted equally from the public improvements, in which case the fraction shall be one divided by the total number of properties which are determined to be benefitted properties. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.68.040 - Amount of fees. 
A.  The fees set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time, but at least annually, after a public hearing, subject to council review and approval, to reflect changes in the project costs of construction. Once determined, the actual cost of construction of these improvements, adjusted for inflation, shall be used. 
B.  The formula for the determination of the amount of these fees for each parcel, based upon net acreage, would be to apply the percentage set forth in the following tables to the cost of the improvements identified: 
1.  For sewer, water and street improvements, this calculation would lead to a distribution of costs as follows (the benefitted properties are identified by assessor's parcel numbers, (APNs)): 
APN Net Acreage Percent 02-060-03(W) 1.07 26.68 02-060-03(E) 1.32 32.92 02-060-04(W) 0.16 3.99 02-060-04(E) 0.18 4.49 02-060-05 1.28 31.92 4.01 100.00  
2.  For storm drainage improvements this calculation would lead to a distribution of costs as follows: 
APN Net Acreage Percent 02-060-03(W) 1.07 20.94 02-060-03(E) 1.32 25.83 02-060-04(W) 0.16 3.13 02-060-04(E) 0.18 3.52 02-060-05 1.28 25.05 02.120.01 1.10 21.53 5.11 100.00  
C.  Once the actual cost of construction has been determined, the annual adjustment thereafter shall be based on both the increase in the actual cost of construction but also upon the interest which these funds would have earned had they been held in the city's enterprise funds instead of used to fund the cost of this construction project. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.68.050 - Disposition of development fees. 
A.  Pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, there is established a separate reserve account, within the street and roads fund, and a separate reserve account within the water enterprise fund and a separate reserve account within the sewer enterprise fund. Any fee paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be placed into the respective reserve accounts established for such fees and used solely for the purpose of implementation of the applicable public purpose for which the reserve account was established. All moneys in the reserve accounts established by this chapter shall be held separate and apart from other city funds. All interest or other earnings of each such reserve account shall be credited to that account. 
B.  All moneys and interest in the reserve accounts established by this chapter shall be expended on the implementation of the applicable public purpose for which the fee was established: 
1.  The reimbursement for all direct and indirect costs incurred by the city for such implementation pursuant to this chapter, including but not limited to, the costs of land acquisition, planning, legal advice, engineering, design, construction and equipment, as well as the actual cost of construction. 
2.  The reimbursement for all costs incurred by the city and associated with the administration of each account. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.68.060 - Annual review. 
A.  Each year, during the budget review process, the council shall review the status of compliance with this chapter, and the degree to which fees collected pursuant to this chapter are mitigating the impacts of new commercial and residential development projects and new development entitlement. 
B.  For each of the reserve accounts established by this chapter, the city shall, within sixty days after the close of each fiscal year, make available to the public all the following information: 
1.  The beginning and ending balance for the fiscal year in that reserve account; 
2.  The fee, interest, and other income to that reserve account for the fiscal year; 
3.  The amount of expenditure by public facility from that reserve account during the fiscal year; 
4.  The amount of refunds made pursuant to Section 6601(e) of the Government Code out of that reserve account during the fiscal year. 
C.  The council shall review the information described in subsection B of this section, at the next regularly scheduled public meeting not less than fifteen days after the information required by that subsection is made available to the public. 
D.  Five years after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the council shall consider a report by the city administrator reviewing the fee formulae established to implement the provisions of this chapter, and their bases to determine whether any adjustments in the fee formulae are warranted. 
E.  Once all the benefitted properties have developed and paid the fees associated with them have been paid, the council shall determine whether there is any further need for this chapter. If there is none, the council may rescind the ordinance codified in this chapter and provide a final accounting of the reserve accounts created pursuant to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

Chapter 17.72 - DEVELOPMENT FEES FOR NEWLY ANNEXED PARCELS 
Sections: 

17.72.010 - Definitions and applicability of chapter. 
A.  Whenever used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: 
    "Affordable housing" means residential property which is to be developed as housing for persons and/or families of very low, low or moderate income, as those terms are defined in Section 65915 (b) of the Government Code. 
    "Benefitted properties" means all properties which are annexed to the city during the term of the tax sharing agreement. 
    "Tax sharing agreement" means the agreement between the city and the county of Madera dated on or about August 14, 1990. 
B.  The fees established by this chapter shall apply to an applicant for the annexation of any benefitted property. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.020 - Findings. 
A.  The city is allowed by law to impose a sales tax of up to one percent of the gross sales which occur within the city and, if the city imposes less than the one percent allowed by law, the county of Madera receives whatever portion of the one percent of gross sales which the city does not receive. The city had, up until the time of the tax sharing agreement, imposed and collected the full one percent sales tax allowed by law and so the county of Madera had received none of this one percent. The local agency formation commission (LAFCO) determined that no annexation of land to the city could proceed without a tax sharing agreement between the city and the county. The county would not enter into a tax sharing agreement with the city unless such agreement included a provision requiring the city to impose less than the one percent sales tax over the ten-year term of the tax sharing agreement. 
B.  All properties which are annexed to the city from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are benefitted by the tax sharing agreement, when those properties annex to the city, and the owners of those benefitted properties should be required to participate in the reimbursement to the city of the costs incurred by the city described herein. 
C.  The purpose of the fees set forth in this chapter is to reimburse the city for the costs of obtaining a tax sharing agreement with the county of Madera. A fair and just cost distribution between the benefitted properties for these costs is to base the distribution upon net acreage of each of the properties. 
D.  Such fees shall be used to reimburse the city's general fund for the cost incurred by the city in entering into said tax sharing agreement, and shall be used by the city in conformity with the limitations placed upon that account. 
E.  There is a reasonable relationship between the purpose of these fees and the benefitted properties because the benefitted properties will benefit from annexation to the city which could not have occurred, but for the tax sharing agreement and the development of the benefitted properties within the city could not occur without such a tax sharing agreement. 
F.  The size of the fees shall be determined by the council by resolution. No such fee shall be set unless it is determined by the council to bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the tax sharing agreement. Each such resolution which sets the amount of the fees shall identify the improvement for which the fee is charged and the method of determining the amount of the fee. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.030 - Payment of and determination of amount of fees. 
    Such fee shall be payable at the time of and as a condition of the city processing an application for annexation to the city. Each of the benefitted properties shall be assessed for a proportional share of the costs to the city of the tax sharing agreement. The council hereby determines that the following formula shall be applied for this purpose: 
A.  For all property, other than property which is annexed for the purpose of being developed as affordable housing, the amount of the fee shall be determined by determining the level of benefit to the property from the tax sharing agreement. The level of benefit shall be expressed as a fraction which shall be the acreage of that particular benefitted property divided by the total acreage of all the benefitted properties which had annexed to the city between the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, including the benefitted property, plus one thousand fifteen acres (which is all the property located in the Greenhills annexation). 
B.  In order to determine the amount of the fees to be paid by this particular benefitted property, that fraction shall then be multiplied by the projected loss in sales tax revenue to the city for the remaining term of the tax sharing agreement. 
C.  Residential property which is to be developed as affordable housing shall count as having no acreage. 
1.  If a portion of the land to be annexed is to be used for an affordable housing project and a portion is to be used for some other purpose, then only that land which is to be used for the other purpose shall be counted in determining that benefitted property's fee. 
2.  If, after land is annexed into the city as property to be developed as affordable housing, the property owner then applies for any development entitlements which are inconsistent with the affordable housing use indicated, the property owner shall be required as a condition of the issuance of that development entitlement to pay all annexation fees which [they] would have had to pay, but for the waiver based on the affordable housing use designation. 
3.  For the purpose of interpreting this section, the term "development entitlements" shall include each of the following: tentative or final parcel map; tentative or final subdivision map; site plan; building permit; certificate of occupancy. 
4.  Once a property has been annexed into the city under the terms of this clause, if it is then developed as and used as affordable housing for a period of ten years, then any future development entitlements for that property would not require the payment of the waived annexation fees. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.040 - Amount of fees. 
    The fees set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time, but at least annually, after a public hearing, subject to council review and approval, to reflect changes in the cost of the tax sharing agreement based upon the actual sales tax revenue received during the immediately preceding year. The formula for the determination of the amount of these fees for each parcel, based upon the fraction determined under the previous code section, would be to multiply the fraction against the total amount of the cost of the tax sharing agreement projected for the balance of the life of the tax sharing agreement, based on the actual sales tax revenue for the preceding year, as determined by the council. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.050 - Disposition of development fees. 
A.  Pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, there is hereby established a separate reserve account, within the general fund. Any fee paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be placed into the reserve account established for such fees and used solely for the purpose of replacing the sales tax revenue not received by the city by virtue of the tax sharing agreement. All moneys in the reserve account established by this chapter shall be held separate and apart from other city funds until the council determines otherwise for that year. All interest or other earnings of each such reserve account shall be credited to that account. 
B.  All moneys and interest in the reserve accounts established by this chapter shall be expended on the implementation of the applicable public purpose for which the fee was established: 
1.  The reimbursement for all direct and indirect costs incurred by the city for such implementation pursuant to this chapter, including but not limited to, the actual revenue lost due to the setting of the prior year's sales tax at a rate lower than one percent; 
2.  The reimbursement for all costs incurred by the city and associated with the administration of each account. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.060 - Annual review. 
A.  Each year, during the budget review process, the council shall review the status of compliance with this chapter, and the degree to which fees collected pursuant to this chapter are mitigating the impacts of new commercial and residential development projects and new development entitlement. 
B.  For the reserve account established by this chapter, the city shall, within sixty days after the close of each fiscal year, make available to the public all the following information: 
1.  The beginning and ending balance for the fiscal year in that reserve account; 
2.  The fee, interest, and other income to that reserve account for the fiscal year; 
3.  The amount of expenditure by line item category from that reserve account during the fiscal year; 
4.  The amount of refunds made pursuant to Section 66001(e) of the Government Code out of that reserve account during the fiscal year. 
C.  The council shall review the information described in subsection B of this section, at the next regularly scheduled public meeting not less than fifteen days after the information required by that subsection is made available to the public. 
D.  Five years after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the council shall consider a report by the city administrator reviewing the fee formulae established to implement the provisions of this chapter, and their bases to determine whether any adjustments in the fee formulae are warranted. 
E.  Once the current tax sharing agreement has been terminated, either by the passage of time or by other means, the council shall determine whether there is any further need for this chapter. If there is none, the council may rescind the ordinance codified in this chapter and provide a final accounting of the reserve accounts created pursuant to this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.070 - Repeal of inconsistent prior actions. 
    Any provision of previously adopted ordinances or resolutions of the city inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, to the extent of such inconsistency and no further, is repealed or modified to the extent necessary to effect the provisions of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.72.080 - Right of appeal to council. 
    Any person subject to a fee required by this chapter may apply to the council for a reduction, adjustment or waiver of that fee based upon the absence of a reasonable relationship between the impact of that person's development project and the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be provided. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
Chapter 17.76 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES 
Sections: 

17.76.010 - Establishment, purpose and use of development impact fees. 
A.  The council creates and establishes a separate development impact fee for the city which shall be used to mitigate unfavorable impacts attributed to new development for public facilities in each of the following categories: fire facilities, equipment and training; general facilities and equipment necessary for the administration of the city which are not listed in any one of the other categories of essential infrastructure; law enforcement facilities, equipment and training; public works facilities and equipment; recreation facilities; sewage collection facilities; sewage treatment facilities; streets and thoroughfares; storm drainage facilities; traffic control facilities; water distribution facilities; or water supply well facilities. The council has already established and affirms its development facility fees for each of the following: 
1.  Water production facilities and water delivery facilities, which are more fully set forth in Section 13.04.065 of this code; 
2.  Sewage treatment facilities and sewage collection facilities, which are more fully set forth in Section 13.12.050 of this code; 
3.  Recreation and park facilities, which is more fully set forth in Section 17.40.010 of this code; 
4.  Storm drainage facilities, which is more fully set forth in Section 17.40.020 of this code. 
    For convenience, all the development fees so established or affirmed shall be referred to in this chapter in the singular, as "the fee." Specifically, the fee shall be used by the city to pay a portion of the costs of designated public facilities and, insofar as is legally permissible, for operations and cost increases due to development. The fee shall be based on a method designed to ensure that developers pay their fair share of the cost of such public facilities required to serve the city's growing population. 
B.  Such public facilities are currently identified in the most recent capital improvement program, master plans, development impact fee studies, and/or any other document adopted by the city specifying public facilities to be constructed , (all of which are referred to collectively hereinafter as the CIP studies) prepared for the city by the director, the city engineer and the city attorney's offices. The CIP facilities may be added to or deleted from the plan, but the council directs that the fee shall be used only for public facilities in any one of the categories of "essential infrastructure," (as that term is defined in this chapter) for which that fee was collected. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018)

    "General facilities and equipment" means the additional space at city hall, the city corporation yard, city offices located elsewhere, city parking areas, and similar facilities, along with necessary equipment in or through which the city conducts general city operations, necessary in order to accommodate the growth in city government which will be necessary in order to maintain the present level of government services and still accommodate the anticipated new development in the city until build out of the city. 
    "Law enforcement facilities, equipment and training" means any capital improvements or capital equipment related to the city police department, along with the cost of recruiting, training and equipping such additional police department personnel as will be required, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide police protection services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and build out of the city. 
    "New development" means any residential, commercial, or industrial development which occurs in the city after the effective date of said ordinance and/or any amendment to this chapter, including but not limited development on any so-called in-fill lots created prior to January 1, 1985 to the extent the resolution implementing this chapter determines that such fees are applicable to in-fill lots. 
    "Public works facilities and equipment" means any capital improvement or capital equipment related to the work of the city's department of public works which is not included in either sewage collection facilities, sewage treatment facilities, streets and thoroughfares, storm drainage facilities, traffic control facilities, water distribution facilities or water supply well facilities, which will be required either to improve and/or expand existing facilities or to construct new facilities, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide public works services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of said ordinance and build out of the city at a level which is comparable to the level currently provided to the existing residents of the city. 
    "Recreation facilities" means any capital improvement or capital equipment related to the city park and recreational facilities, which will be required either to improve and/or expand existing facilities or to construct new facilities, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide park and recreational services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and build out of the city at a level which is comparable to the level currently provided to the existing residents of the city. This fee does not include the actual acquisition of the land for new parks or the expansion of existing parks, since that is in fact subject to the Quimby Act and Section 17.40.010 of this code and may require new development to provide land (or a fee in lieu of land) at a level of service which is higher than is currently provided by the city. 
    "Related facilities" means any major landscaping, fountains, monuments, signs or similar facilities, activities and operations of a general benefit to the city which will be necessary to construct adequate facilities to meet the needs of new development within the city, as described in the CIP studies, or any of them.

This sum does not include any such facilities which the developer is required to provide himself but is calculated using data based upon the capacity of shared facilities. 
    "Sewage treatment facilities" means all of the sewage treatment facilities, including sewage treatment plants, basins for de-watering treated or partially treated sewage, sludge drying beds, sludge storage and transportation facilities, any farm land acquired by the city for the purpose of disposing of water which is the byproduct of the treatment of sewage, and related facilities which are necessary for the purpose of treating domestic sewage as will be required by the city, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide sewage treatment services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of said ordinance and build out of the city. The provisions of Section 13.12.050 of this code set forth the method by which the amount of this fee is calculated. 
    "Streets and thoroughfares" means the cost of widening, construction of additional lanes of travel as well as other work which will be required due to new development generating additional motor vehicle trips on the city's existing network or arterial, collector and local streets, as is defined in detail in the CIP studies. These costs include but are not limited to the costs of the acquisition of additional right of way, the cost of clearing, grading and paving as well as the costs of necessary traffic studies to determine the timing of the construction of these facilities so that the city's traffic congestion level remains at no worse than at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
    "Storm drainage facilities" means all of the stormwater collection, retention and disposal facilities, including stormwater mains, ditches, canals, pumps, pump stations, retention basin, detention basins and related facilities which are necessary for the purpose of collecting stormwater run-off and transporting it to the appropriate stormwater basin as will be required, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide sewage collection services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of said ordinance and build out of the city. This sum does not include any such facilities which the developer is required to provide himself but is calculated using data based upon the capacity of shared facilities. The provisions of Section 17.40.020 of this code set forth the method by which the amount of this fee is calculated. 
    "Traffic control facilities" means the cost of acquiring, installing, wiring and regulating traffic signals, traffic signs and any other traffic control devices which will be required to regulate the flow of motor vehicle traffic due to new development generating additional motor vehicle trips on the city's existing network of arterial, collector and local streets, as is defined in detail in the CIP studies. 
    "Water distribution facilities" means all of the domestic water facilities, including water mains, water laterals, pumps and pump stations and related facilities which are necessary for the purpose of transporting domestic water from the water well to any water storage facility, if necessary, and then transporting and delivering domestic water to the ultimate user of that water as will be required, based on the CIP studies, or any of them, to provide water delivery services to the new development which is projected to come into the city between the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and build out of the city. This sum does not include any such facilities which the developer is required to provide himself but is calculated using data based upon the capacity of shared facilities.

( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.030 - Relationship between the need for the additional public facilities and the type of development. 
    For all the essential infrastructure the council is committed to maintaining the same level of public facilities and services and the same facilities-to-population relationship which existed on the date of the most recent amendment of this chapter in order to ensure that, to the extent that growth of the city occurs in the future, there will be an adequate level of public facilities and services. For park land, the council determines, pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code, to require new development to either dedicate land or pay fees in lieu thereof based on a minimum ratio of at least three acres of land per one thousand new residents of the city, even though that ratio exceeds the actual ratio in existence at the time of the adoption of the ordinance establishing this new standard. The council finds that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for additional public facilities, equipment and operations which the fee is designed to pay, and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons: 
A.  The council has determined that commercial and industrial developments result in a need for additional public services which, in turn, ultimately result in a need for additional government and public facilities for essential infrastructure and related facilities. Based on the level of public services and public facilities-to-population relationship which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter, and the extent to which commercial and industrial developments contribute to growth, the council determines that commercial and industrial development should be assessed at rates to be established by resolution of the council as the fair share of contribution for the costs of these required facilities and services. 
B.  The council has determined that residential development, including new mobilehome park development, results in significant increases in city population and that such residential development adversely affects the public facilities-to-population relationship which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter. The council has further determined that because residential development results in significant increases in population, such development results in the need for essential infrastructure and related facilities (including but not limited to parks and recreation facilities) based on the public facilities-to-population relationship which existed on said date, residential development shall be assessed at the rate established by resolution of the council for the costs for these required public facilities and services. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.040 - Adjustment of fee. 
    The fee set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time but not less than annually, subject to council review and approval, after a noticed public hearing, to reflect changes in costs as determined by the city administrator and department head level staff. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.050 - Relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of facilities attributable to the development upon which the fee is imposed. 
    The council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee set by resolution of the council and the cost of the public facilities or portions thereof attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed. The basis for such determination is set out in reports to the council from the city administrator, the director and the city engineer and such consultants as the council determines are necessary, if any, to develop accurate costs and fees to cover such costs. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.060 - Relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development upon which the fee is imposed. 
    The council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee for specified categories of public facilities and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons: 
A.  The council finds that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for parks and recreation facilities is not reasonable because the council determines that there is no substantial demand placed on such facilities as a result of commercial and industrial development. The council finds further that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for stormwater facilities is reasonable in instances where regional collection systems and drainage basins are planned. However, the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for stormwater facilities is not reasonable where no regional collection systems and basins are planned, and the city has required such commercial and industrial development to provide for its own on-site disposal of site generated stormwater thereby substantially diverting its demand on the city's stormwater facilities as a result of such commercial and industrial development. Because commercial and industrial developments do increase demand on all other essential infrastructure and related facilities, the council finds that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for such facilities is reasonable and is supported by the city engineer's applicable stormwater calculations and estimates based on site use. 
B.  The council finds that the use of fees generated from residential development for all essential infrastructure and related facilities, including but not limited to parks and recreations facilities and stormwater fees, is reasonable because growth in residential population places demand on all such facilities as outlined and provided under the general plan and its associated environmental documents. 
C.  The council further finds that funding of the costs of essential infrastructure, including capital equipment set forth in the current CIP studies of the city engineer on file with the public works department and/or the office of the city engineer accomplishes the goals and purposes set forth in subsections A and B of this section and that the use of revenues generated by the specified development impact fees for projects and outlays set forth in the CIP studies is warranted and justified. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.070 - Payment of fee. 
    Any owner or developer applying for a building permit for commercial or industrial development shall be assessed and shall pay the fee in conjunction with payment for the building permit subject to the provisions of Government Code Section 66007. Any owner or developer of a residential development shall pay the fee on the date of final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs first. In the case of subdivision, the fees shall be paid on a lump sum basis, as follows: 
A.  When the first dwelling in the development receives its final inspection or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first, that portion of the fee shall be paid which represents payment for each of the following: fire facilities, equipment and training; general facilities and equipment; law enforcement facilities, equipment and training; public works facilities and equipment. 
B.  As a condition of filing the final subdivision map, that portion of the fee shall be paid which represents payment for each of the following: recreation facilities; sewage collection facilities; sewage treatment facilities; streets and thoroughfares; storm drainage facilities; traffic control facilities; water distribution facilities; or water supply well facilities. 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.080 - Exempted activities. 
    Any owner or developer engaging in development activities which satisfy the following criteria shall not be required to pay the fee: 
A.  An alteration which does not increase the floor area of a structure; or 
B.  An addition to a single-family residential dwelling unit which does not constitute the addition of a dwelling unit as defined by the Uniform Building Code; 
C.  Construction of a single-family dwelling on a legal lot that was created prior to January 1, 1985 (in-fill development). 
( Ord. No. 492-18 , § 2(Att. A), 12-11-2018) 
17.76.085 - Multi-family in-fill. 
    Any owner or developer engaging in development activities which satisfy the following criteria shall not be required to pay the fee: 
    Any owner or developer engaging in the development activities for multiple units constructed on legal in-fill lots created prior to January 1, 1985 shall pay the following facility and development fees based on the following number of units:

Sections: 

18.06.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish zone districts and a zoning map to classify, regulate, restrict, and segregate the uses of land and buildings, to regulate and restrict the height and bulk of buildings, and to regulate the area of yards and other open spaces about buildings, and to regulate the density of population. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.020 - Applicability. 
    The zoning districts are applicable in all areas of the city. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.030 - Establishment of zone districts. 
A.  Base zone districts establish the basic land use and property development regulations applicable to all property within the city, as provided in Section 18.02.110. Overlay zone districts provide additional regulations that are to be exercised over certain lands within the overlay zone to meet special community health, safety, welfare, environmental or development objectives described by the general plan or a specific plan. Overlay zone district regulations apply in addition to base zone district regulations and other regulations of this chapter. 
B.  The base zoning districts are hereby established as follows: 
1.  Low Density Residential zone, abbreviated as R-L. 
2.  Medium Density Residential zone, abbreviated as R-M. This zone is divided into: 
a.  Medium Density Residential zone, five thousand square foot lots abbreviated as R-M-5. 
b.  Medium Density Residential zone, six thousand square foot lots abbreviated as R-M-6. 
3.  Medium High Density Residential zone, abbreviated as R-MH.

C.  The overlay zoning districts are hereby established as follows: 
1.  Airport Overlay zone, abbreviated at AO. 
2.  Specific Plan Overlay zone, abbreviated as SPO. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.040 - Establishment of zoning map. 
A.  To ensure that comprehensive zoning regulations may be applied uniformly to all incorporated territory upon adoption of this title, a zoning map is hereby established to delineate the location and boundaries of zone districts within the city. The zoning map is incorporated into this title by this reference with the same force and effect as if the boundaries, together with any notations, references, and information shown on the zoning map were specifically stated and described in this title. 
B.  The zoning map, together with such additional maps as may be adopted in accordance with the provisions of this title, shall be collectively known as the "City of Chowchilla Zoning Map." 
C.  The official copy of the zoning map shall be kept, maintained, and made available to the public by the Chowchilla Community Development Department. The zoning map may be maintained in hard copy and/or electronic formats. 
D.  All property within incorporated territory shall be delineated within a zoning district on the zoning map. 
E.  The location of zoning districts on the zoning map shall be consistent with the applicable policies and land use designations set forth in the general plan. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.050 - Interpretation of zoning boundary lines. 
    Whenever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary line between two zoning districts shown on the zoning map, the following interpretations shall control: 
A.  Where a zoning boundary line is indicated as following a street, alley, railroad right-of-way, drainage channel, or other watercourse, the center line of such street, alley, railroad right-of-way, drainage channel, or other watercourse shall be the boundary line. 
B.  Where a zoning boundary line is indicated as following a lot line or property line, the boundary line shall be construed as following such lot line or property line. 
C.  Where a zoning boundary line is not indicated as following a street or alley and does not follow or coincide approximately with a lot line or property line, the zoning boundary line shall be determined using the scale designated on the zoning map. 
D.  Where further uncertainty exists, the planning commission, upon a written application from the owner of the property in question or upon its own motion, shall determine the location of the zoning boundary line in question, giving due consideration to the location indicated on the zoning map, the purposes and objectives of the zoning ordinance, and the applicable policies set forth in the general plan. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.060 - Zone changes. 
A.  Changes to the zoning map shall be approved by ordinance of the city council in accordance with Chapter 18.86. 
B.  When the director determines that there is a technical error on the zoning map, the zoning map may be corrected to remove the technical error without approval of an ordinance. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.06.070 - Prezoning. 
    Territories proposed for annexation into the city shall be prezoned concurrent with the city council initiation of annexation proceedings, in accordance with Chapter 18.86.

Chapter 18.56 - SIGNS AND OUTDOOR ADVERTISING STRUCTURES 
Section: 

18.56.290 - Enforcement. 
18.56.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs as an information system that preserves and enhances the aesthetic character and environmental values of Chowchilla, its residential neighborhoods, its downtown, and commercial/industrial areas, while also providing an effective means for members of the public to express themselves through the display of signs. These regulations recognize the importance of business activity to the economic vitality of the city as well as the need to protect the visual environment. Specifically, these regulations are intended to implement the general plan and to: 
1.  Provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, public welfare, and traffic safety by controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of signs and sign structures; 
2.  Preserve and enhance the visual attractiveness of the city for residents, businesses, and visitors; 
3.  Protect and enhance property values and community appearance by encouraging signs that are compatible with the architectural style, character, and scale of the building to which they relate and with adjacent buildings and businesses; 
4.  Restrict signs that may create visual clutter or a nuisance to nearby properties, violate privacy, or create hazards or unreasonable distractions for pedestrians and drivers; 
5.  Provide adequate opportunity for the exercise of the free speech by display of a message or image on a sign, while balancing that opportunity with other community and public interests; 
6.  Ensure that commercial signs are accessory or auxiliary to a principal business or establishment on the same premises, rather than functioning as general advertising for hire; and 
7.  Prohibit signs that may cause traffic or pedestrian safety hazards or interfere with ingress and egress. 
B.  It is the city's policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner that is content neutral as to noncommercial messages which are within the protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the corollary provisions of the California Constitution. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018)

18.56.030 - No discrimination against noncommercial speech. 
    Subject to the property owner's consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any commercial message or any other noncommercial message provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this title. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.

( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.56.070 - Sign design principles. 
A.  The following sign design principles should be used as criteria for review and approval of sign permits and master sign programs. 
1.  Architectural Compatibility. A sign, including its supporting structure, if any, should be designed as an integral design element of a building's architecture and be architecturally compatible, including color and scale, with any building to which the sign is to be attached and with surrounding structures. A sign that covers a window or that spills over "natural" boundaries or architectural features and obliterates parts of upper floors of buildings is detrimental to visual order and will not be permitted. Common indicators of compatibility include quality sign design and construction, proportional size and scale; and use of materials, shapes and colors that complement the building's architectural style and the surrounding environment. 
2.  Legibility. The size and proportion of the elements of the sign's message, including logos, letters, icons, and other graphic images, should be selected based on the average distance and average travel speed of the viewer. Sign messages oriented towards pedestrians may be smaller than those oriented towards automobile drivers. Colors chosen for the sign text and/or graphics should have sufficient contrast with the sign background in order to be easily read during both day and night. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words. Substantial contrast should be provided between the color and materials of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read. 
3.  Readability. A sign message should be easily recognized and designed in a clear, unambiguous and concise manner, so that a viewer can understand or make sense of what appears on the sign. 
4.  Visibility. A sign should be conspicuous and readily distinguishable from its surroundings, so a viewer can easily see the information it communicates. 
5.  Placement. Often, a building's architectural details create logical places for signage. Signs should not cover or interrupt architectural details or ornaments of a building's façade. On buildings with a monolithic or plain façade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. Well-designed and well-located retail signs create visual interest and continuity with other storefronts on the same or adjacent buildings. 
6.  Materials. Signs shall be made of sturdy, durable materials. Paper, cardboard, or other material subject to rapid deterioration can only be used for signs that comply with applicable requirements for temporary signs. Fabric signs are restricted to awnings, canopies, flags, and temporary signs. 
B.  Sign permits or master sign programs that are determined by the director to be substantially inconsistent with these sign design principles may be denied. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.56.080 - Rules for sign measurement. 
A.  For the purposes of this chapter, lot frontage shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  If a lot fronts on two streets, both frontages may be used to determine the allowable sign area. 
2.  If a lot fronts on three or more streets, the length of only two contiguous sides shall be added together to determine allowable sign area. 
B.  The building frontage shall be the building facade in which main customer access is provided to the establishment. A building's frontage is considered continuous if projections or recesses in the building facade do not exceed fifteen feet in any direction. For buildings with two or more frontages, the length of the wall and allowable sign area shall be calculated separately for each building frontage. 
C.  The area of an individual sign shall be calculated as follows. 
1.  Sign area shall include the entire area within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles that enclose the extreme limits of all sign elements, including, but not limited to, sign structures or borders, written copy, logos, symbols, illustrations, and color. Supporting structures such as sign bases and columns are not included in sign area provided that they contain no lettering or graphics. 
2.  Where two faces of a double-faced sign are located two feet or less from one another at all points or located at an interior angle of forty-five degrees or less from one another, the sign area shall be calculated as the area of one face. Where the two faces are not equal in size, the larger sign face shall be used. Where two faces of a double-faced sign are located more than two feet or forty-five degrees from one another, both sign faces shall be counted toward sign area. 
3.  On a three-faced sign, where at least one interior angle is forty-five degrees or less, the sign area shall be calculated as the sum of the largest and the smallest face. In all other situations involving a sign with three or more sides, sign area shall be calculated as the sum of all faces. 
4.  Three-Dimensional Signs. The size of signs that consist of, or have attached to them, one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks), shall be calculated as the sum of the square footage of the two adjacent sides of the smallest theoretical cube that would encompass the sign. 
D.  The height of a sign shall be calculated as follows. 
1.  The height of a sign that is not a freestanding sign shall be the vertical distance measured from the ground level directly beneath the sign to the highest point at the top of the sign, including any structural or architectural components of the sign. 
2.  The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade at the edge of the right-of-way along which a freestanding sign is placed to the highest point of the freestanding sign, including any structural or architectural components of the sign. When the grade at the edge of the right-of-way is higher than the site on which the sign is placed, that portion of the sign below the grade at the edge of the right-of-way shall not be included in determining the freestanding sign's overall height. Freestanding signs oriented towards a freeway shall be measured from the site's finished grade or pad, whichever is lower. 
E.  Sign clearance shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments. 
F.  For the purpose of determining the allowed number and size of signs, an integrated shopping center shall be considered as one site.

WCF with support structures must be constructed to Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard titled "Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures" (or equivalent), as it may be updated or amended. Antenna/towers supported by guy wires are prohibited within the city. 
C.  Lighting. WCF shall not be artificially lighted, except for: 
1.  Security and safety lighting of equipment buildings if such lighting is appropriately shielded to keep light within the boundaries of the site; and 
2.  Lighting of the tower or antenna may be required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable authority. Said lighting is to be installed in a manner to minimize impacts on adjacent properties. 
D.  Security. WCF with tower/antenna structures shall be enclosed by a security fence not less than six feet in height and the structure shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
E.  Noise. A description of all audible noise generating equipment, including the times and decibel levels of the noise which will be produced shall be submitted with the application for the project. No equipment shall be operated at a WCF which produces noise in excess of the applicable noise standards stated in the Chowchilla General Plan. In emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis as determined by the community development department. 
F.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding WCF sites: 
1.  The site shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least five feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound's fence. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether in the discretion of the director and where applicable, the planning commission. 
2.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible, as determined by the director; provided, however, vegetation causing interference with the antennas or inhibits access to the equipment facility may be trimmed. 
G.  Painting. All equipment, antennas, poles or towers shall have a non-reflective finish and shall be painted or otherwise treated to minimize visual impacts. Antennas which will be viewed primarily against the skyline shall be painted light gray or light blue or other sky blending color. WCF with tower antenna structures shall be designed and painted to blend in with existing surroundings to the extent feasible as determined by the community development department, including the use of compatible colors. Equipment facilities shall, to the extent practicable, use materials, colors and textures that will blend with the natural setting and existing building environment. 
H.  Visual Aesthetics. To minimize overall visual impact, new wireless communication facilities shall be co-located with existing facilities and with other planned new facilities whenever possible. In addition, service providers shall co-locate antennas with other facilities such as water tanks, light standards, and other utility structures where the co-location is found to minimize the overall visual impact. Conditions of approval shall require all applicants to cooperate in the placement of equipment and antennas to accommodate the maximum number of providers at a single site and require an applicant to allow for future co-location of additional antennas at its site. Antenna/towers with guy wires are prohibited. Cables leading from the antenna to the ground base equipment be neatly bundled and securely fastened to the antenna/tower and be underground from the antenna/tower to the equipment room.

B.  If said standards and regulations are modified or amended and require pre-existing WCFs to comply with the new or amended standards or regulations, the owners and operators of the towers and antennas shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of the new standards and regulations, unless the new standards or regulations or the applicable federal or state agency identify a different and specific compliance period, in which case the owners and operators of the towers and antennas shall bring their towers and antennas into compliance within that specific compliance period. 
C.  Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute a violation of this chapter and the city may require removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
( Ord. No. 491-18 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
18.68.140 - Removal of abandoned antennas, towers, supporting equipment and structures. 
A.  Any antenna, tower, supporting equipment and structure that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna tower, or owner of the land which it is located on shall remove said antenna, tower or supporting equipment within ninety days of receipt of notice from the director notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety days, the city may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
B.  If the cost of removal of the antenna or tower are not paid within thirty days after the date on which the notice of request for payment is mailed to the owner of the property, the city council may direct the county tax assessor to place the unpaid costs, including administrative fees associated with the removal on the county tax roll, as a special assessment against the property pursuant to Section 25845 of the Government Code of the state of California. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes.

Public notice for a hearing should be published at least once in a local newspaper no later than ten days before the hearing. The notice should briefly describe the project, highlight the major environmental impacts expected, and indicate where the environmental impact report can be obtained if it is available. 
D.  No public or private project which will have serious detrimental environmental impact and to which there are feasible alternatives or available mitigating measures shall be approved. 
E.  After preparing an environmental impact report, the city shall make it available to the public for inspection. Members of the general public requesting copies of the report shall pay the actual cost of that copy. Copies of the report shall be distributed to such public agencies as may have legal jurisdiction over or special expertise in various impacts. 
F.  A final environmental impact report as described in Section 15146 of the state guidelines shall be prepared upon completion of the review process. It must summarize the report, and must describe the disposition of issues raised (e.g., revisions to the proposed project to mitigate anticipated impacts of objections). In particular, the major issue raised when the city's position is at variance with recommendations and objections must be addressed in detail (e.g., reasons why specific comments and suggestions could not be accepted, and factors of overriding importance prohibiting the incorporation of suggestions).
