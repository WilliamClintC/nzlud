The Town of Elsmere, as the Franchising Authority for the Town of Elsmere,

they currently read and hereafter may be amended, which are herewith
incorporated by reference.

party, including but not limited to the Franchising Authority or its designee,
the cable operator, subscribers and residents of the franchise area. In
addition to all other provisions required by the laws of the State of Delaware
and the Town of Elsmere for such proceedings, and in order to provide for
§ 5-5 ELSMERE CODE § 9-2

such opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested party, the
Franchising Authority shall take the following actions:
A. The Franchising Authority shall publish in a local newspaper (and/or,
as appropriate, post in a conspicuous place in Town Hall), and mail,
by certified mail, to the cable operator a public notice of the intent to
conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates and/or charges
for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the FCC,
the cable operator will pay for any costs associated with the public
notice.
B. Said public notice shall state, among other things, that cable television
rates are subject to municipal review and explain the nature of the rate
review in question; that any interested party has a right to participate in
the proceeding, that public views may be submitted in the proceeding,
explaining how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting
any such view; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the
cable television rates or equipment rate in question will be governed
by the Rules and Regulations of the FCC; and that the decision of the
Franchising Authority is subject to review by the FCC.
C. The Franchising Authority shall conduct a public proceeding to
determine whether the rates or proposed rate increase or decrease are
reasonable and shall be vested with all powers of a presiding officer to
conduct such public proceeding.
(1) Nature of the proceeding. The nature of such proceeding will be
determined by the Franchising Authority and may include public
hearing, opportunities for the submission of written or oral
comment, informal meetings or as the Franchising Authority
otherwise determines appropriate under the circumstances.
(2) Record. The Franchising Authority will maintain a record of all
written submission. At the discretion of the Franchising Authority,
in appropriate cases, a transcript of any statement made at a public
proceeding will be maintained; provided, however, that the cable
operator may request, at the time it submits any proposed rates or
changes in rate, that the Franchising Authority direct a transcript
of such proceeding, provided further that upon such request the
cable operator shall pay all costs of such transcript, including copies
for the Franchising Authority, and shall provide two copies of such
transcript to the Franchising Authority as soon as reasonably
possible.
(3) Delegation. The Franchising Authority may delegate the
responsibility to conduct the proceeding to any duly qualified and
eligible individual(s) or entity.
(4) Orders. If the Franchising Authority or its designee cannot
determine the reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the
time period permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, it may
toll the effective date of the proposed rates for an additional period
of time as permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, and issue
any other necessary or appropriate order and give public notice
accordingly.
§ 9-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 9-2
1:9
D. In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the Franchising
Authority may request additional information from the cable operator
or any other party that is reasonably necessary to determine the
reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment charges.
(1) Verification. Any such additional information submitted to the
Franchising Authority by the cable operator shall be verified by an
authorized representative of the cable television system supervising
the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and
submitted by way of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating
that the response is true and accurate to the best of that person's
knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry.
(2) Proprietary information. The Franchising Authority may request
propriety information, provided that the Franchising Authority shall
consider a timely request from the cable operator that said
proprietary information shall not be made available for public
information, consistent with the procedures set forth in Section
0.459 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Furthermore, said
proprietary information may be used only for the purpose of
determining the reasonableness of the rates and charges or the
appropriate rate level based on a benchmark rate or a cost-of-service
showing submitted by the cable operator.
(3) Powers. The Franchising Authority may exercise all powers under
the laws of evidence applicable to administrative proceedings under
the laws of the State of Delaware and of the Town of Elsmere to
discover any information relevant to the rate regulation proceeding,
including but not limited to subpoena, interrogatories, production of
documents and deposition. The Franchising Authority may require
the attendance as witness of one or more representatives of the
cable operator.
E. Upon termination of the rate regulation proceeding, the Franchising
Authority shall adopt and release a written decision as to whether the
rate or proposed rate increase are reasonable or unreasonable, and
if unreasonable, its remedy, including prospective rate reduction, rate
prescription and refunds.
F. The Franchising Authority may not impose any fines, penalties,
forfeitures or other sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC Rules
and Regulations, for charging an unreasonable rate or proposing an
unreasonable rate increase. However, the Franchising Authority may
impose fines or monetary forfeitures on a cable operator that does not
comply with a rate decision or refund order of the Franchising Authority,
directed specifically at the cable operator, pursuant to the laws of the
State of Delaware, the Codes, Rules and Regulations of the Town of
Elsmere.
G. Consistent with FCC Rules and Regulations, the Franchising Authority's
decision may be reviewed only by the FCC.
H. The Franchising Authority shall be authorized, at any time, whether or
not in the course of a rate regulation proceeding, to gather information
as necessary to exercise its jurisdiction as authorized by the laws of
the State of Delaware, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,

1:10
and the FCC Rules and Regulations. Any information submitted to the
Franchising Authority shall be verified by an authorized representative
of the cable television system supervising the preparation of the
response on behalf of the entity, and submitted by way of affidavit or
under penalty of perjury, stating that the response is true and accurate
to the best of that person's knowledge, information and belief formed
after reasonable inquiry.
§ 9-3. Certification by FCC.
The Franchising Authority shall file with the FCC the required Certification
form (FCC Form 328). Thirty days later, or as soon thereafter as
appropriate, the Franchising Authority shall notify the cable operator that
the Franchising Authority has been certified by the FCC and that it has
adopted all necessary regulations so as to begin regulating basic service
tier cable television rates and equipment charges.
§ 9-4. Notification of changes in rates, equipment or nature of
service.
With regard to the cable programming service tier, as defined by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC Rules and

to exercise rate regulation, the cable operator shall give notice to the
Franchising Authority of any change in rate for the cable programming
service tier or tiers, any change in the charge for equipment required to
receive the tier or tiers, and any changes in the nature of the services
provided, including the program services included in the tier or tiers. The
cable operator shall provide such notice 30 days before the charges are to
become effective.

subsection of this section shall prevent the substitution of another

to vote, depending on the decision. A person denied permission to
vote shall leave the polling place immediately. A person challenged for
bribery may take and subscribe to the oath as provided in § 4940 of Title

pay or other valuable thing or reward; that I have not been promised,
or in any manner been led to believe that I will at any time directly or
indirectly receive any money, pay or other valuable thing or reward from
such candidate or other person other than that provided by law and if
I shall discover any partiality, unfairness or corruption in the conduct of
the election, I shall disclose the same to the Board of Elections that is
conducting the election and to the Attorney General to the end that the
subject may be investigated, so help me God (or so I solemnly affirm).
F. Bribery.
(1) No person who is accused of receiving or accepting or offering to
receive or accept, or who pays, transfers or delivers, or offers or
promises to pay, transfer or deliver, or who contributes or offers or
promises to contribute to another to be paid or used any money or other
valuable thing as a compensation, inducement or reward for giving or
withholding or in any manner influencing the giving or withholding
a vote at any Town of Elsmere election shall vote at such election
unless such person being challenged for any of said causes takes and
subscribes to the oath or affirmation as provided for in § 4940 of Title
15.
(2) Such oath or affirmation shall be conclusive evidence to the Election
Officers of the truth of such oath or affirmation, but if any such oath or
affirmation shall be false, the person making the same shall be guilty of
perjury, and no conviction thereon shall bar any prosecution under § 8
of Article V of the Constitution of this state. Such oath or affirmation,

or polling place. Each Election Officer shall witness and verify that
the numbers listed on the voting machine certificate are the same as
the voting machine serial number, case seal number, printer door seal
number, ballot number and protective counter number on the voting
machine. If a number is different, the Inspector shall strike through the
§ 19-10 ELSMERE CODE § 19-10
1:22
number, enter the appropriate correction, and initial the entry on each
of the certificates.
(4) The Election Officers shall then observe the opening of the polls
procedure for each voting machine assigned to the district or polling
place. If the light in the "polls ready to open" box on the officer's control
panel is in any other but the top position prior to the Inspector pressing
the open polls button, stop the procedure and contact the Board of
Elections. The machine cannot be used. If, during the opening of the
polls procedure, the paper tape shows "error all counters not zero," stop
the procedure and contact the Board of Elections. The machine cannot
be used. At the conclusion of the open polls procedure for each voting
machine assigned to the district or polling place as appropriate, each
Election Officer signs the paper tape. Each Election Officer shall then
sign § 1 of the voting machine certificate after any discrepancies that
were observed were noted on the certificate.
(5) At the time the polls are scheduled to open, the Inspector shall admit
voters and authorized challengers to the voting room.
I. Voting procedure.
(1) Since the Town uses the state's voter registration information as the
basis of permitting a person to vote, the following procedure applies:
A person shall show proof of identity and address, the Election Officer
shall circle the person's name on the poll list, have that person sign
the voter log, give the person an authorization to vote, and direct that
person to the voting machine.
(2) If the Election Officer determines that the person is not eligible to
vote in the election, the Election Officer shall refer the person to the
Inspector. The Inspector, after hearing and considering evidence, shall
determine whether to permit the person to vote. Upon making the
decision, the Inspector shall appropriately annotate the poll list and/or
voter log.
(3) If a person's eligibility to vote is challenged by anyone for any reason,
the Inspector shall immediately hear and consider the evidence and
then decide whether the person is eligible to vote. Once the Inspector
has made that Inspector's decision, there is no appeal at the polling
place.
J. At the close of the polls; unofficial results.

voting machine, record the protective counter and seal numbers on the

§ 19-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 19-10
1:23
tabulation for the election, and post a copy of the results tape from each
voting machine on the door of the polling place.

the unofficial results announced, shall deliver all election documents,
envelopes and absentee ballots to the Town of Elsmere's Board of
Elections.

envelopes and absentee ballots until such time that they need to canvass
the election.

(4) A voter may only vote for two or more choices for any office or
question when specifically instructed on the ballot that it is
allowable;

candidates and/or responses to a question, the voter may make fewer
than the allowable number of choices;
(6) If a ballot is marked for more names or responses than are
permitted, it shall not be counted for that office or question, but it
shall be counted for all other offices or questions on the ballot in
accordance with these rules; and
(7) If a ballot has been defaced or torn so that it is impossible to
determine the voter's choice for one or more offices or questions,

choice(s) can be determined.

and the next closest candidate is 1/2 of 1% or less than the total
votes cast for the office.
(4) If, following certification of the election and the resolution of any
contest, there is a tie vote, then the State Election Commissioner
shall order a new election in which only the candidates or positions
tied will be on the ballot. The Town shall conduct the special election

Department of Elections shall defray the cost of such election to a
cap of $2,500.
(5) The Board of Election, following certification of the election and the
resolution of any contest, shall audit the election records in order to

1:25
B. Who may contest; causes. Any person claiming to be elected to an office
within the Town of Elsmere may contest the right of any person declared
to be duly elected to such office for any of the following causes:
(1) For malconduct on the part of the Election Officers or clerks holding
the election, or any one of them.
(2) When the person whose right to the office is contested was not at
the time of the election eligible for such office.

Inspector, Judge, or clerk of election any bribe or reward or shall
have offered any bribe or reward for the purpose of procuring his or
her election.
(4) On account of illegal votes.
C. Irregularities not invalidating election. No inequality or improper
conduct in the proceedings of the Election Officers or clerks or any one
of them shall be construed to amount to such malconduct as to annul
or set aside any election unless the inequality or improper conduct
shall have been such as to procure the person whose right to the office
may be contested to be declared duly elected when he or she has not
received the highest number of legal votes cast at the election.
D. Requirements to set aside election because of illegal voting. Nothing in
§ 19-12 of this chapter shall be so construed as to authorize an election
to be set aside or annulled on account of illegal votes unless it shall
appear that an amount of illegal votes has been given to the person
whose right to the office is contested which, if taken from the person,
would reduce the number of the person's legal votes below the number
of votes given to some other person for the same office, after deducting
therefrom the illegal votes which may be shown to have been given to
such other person.
E. Circumstances under which contestant need not claim to have been
elected. When an election is contested because of alleged malconduct of
the Election Officers holding the election, or because the person whose
right to office is contested was not eligible for such office, a proceeding
may be instituted under § 19-12 of this chapter against such person by
the person who received the next highest number of votes for the office
at the election under which such ineligible person was declared elected,
notwithstanding the person so contesting the election does not claim to
have been elected.
F. Statement of contestant; contents. When any person authorized to do so
under § 19-12 of this chapter desires to contest the right of any person
declared duly elected to such office, he or she shall, within 20 days
after the result of the election shall have been officially ascertained
by the Board of Canvass or officers legally authorized to ascertain
the same, and at least 60 days before the first day of the term of
court at which the contest shall be tried or called for trial, file with
the Prothonotary in the county in which the contest is made a full,
particular, and explicit statement setting forth fully and specifically
the names of any and all Election Officers upon the malconduct of
whom he or she will rely and respecting which he or she intends
to procure evidence, and setting forth the election districts of such
§ 19-12 ELSMERE CODE § 19-12
1:26
Election Officers and the particular malconduct of each, respectively,
and the names and residences of the witnesses and the substance of
their testimony, by whom he or she expects to prove such malconduct.
If such contest is based upon ineligibility of a person to hold the office,
the statement shall specifically, fully, and explicitly state the grounds
and causes of the ineligibility of the person whose right to the office
is contested. When such contest is based on alleged bribe or reward,
or the offer of a bribe or reward, the statement shall explicitly, fully,
and clearly state the name of any elector, Election Officer, or other
person to whom any bribe or reward shall have been offered and the
time, place and amount of such bribe or reward and the name and
residence of the witnesses by whom the contestant expects to prove
the offering of any bribe or reward, with a brief statement of their
testimony. When the contest shall be on the ground of illegal votes,
the statement shall specifically, fully, and explicitly set forth the names,
residences and respective causes of disqualification of each person
alleged to have illegally voted, the polls at which such illegal vote
has been received, the names of the Election Officers favoring the
acceptance of such vote, whether such vote was challenged by the duly
accredited challenger of the party of which the contestant was the
candidate, and whether all the judges or inspectors present at such polls
concurred in accepting and receiving such vote. If it appears that all
of such judges or inspectors concurred in accepting or receiving such
vote, or that the right of the voters respectively, to deposit such votes
was not at the time challenged by the duly accredited challenger of the
party of which the contestant was a candidate, the legality or illegality
of such vote shall not be brought into question in any such contest.
The statement shall further set forth the names and residences of the
witnesses who shall be produced on behalf of the contestant to prove
such illegal votes and the substance of the testimony to be given by
each.
G. Verification of contestant's statement. The statement shall be verified by
the oath of the contestant that the matters therein set forth are, so far
as they relate to his or her own act and deed, true and that what relates
to the act and deed of any other person he or she believes to be true.
H. Security for costs. Any person contesting any election under § 19-12 of
this chapter shall be required to give security for costs in such amount
and manner as the Court shall order. Such security, however, shall in
no case be enforced unless judgment for costs is rendered against the
contestant.
I. Citation; service and return. Before the statement is filed, the
Prothonotary shall docket the case in the appearance docket and
immediately issue a citation for the person whose right to the office is
contested to appear on the first day of the second term of the Superior
Court to make such defense as he or she may have, which citation shall
be delivered to the Sheriff or, if the Sheriff is a party to the contest,
to the coroner of the county, and be served by him or her upon the
party defendant in person or, if the party defendant cannot be found,
by leaving a copy thereof at the house where the party defendant
§ 19-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 19-12
1:27
last resided at least five days before the day to which such citation is
returnable. The original citation shall be returned to the Prothonotary
on or before the first day of the next term of Court after it is issued,
and the manner of service shall be endorsed thereon and signed by the
officer serving the same.
J. Dismissal of proceedings. The Court may dismiss the proceedings if
the statement of the cause or causes of contest do not conform to
the requirements set forth in § 19-12 of this chapter or for want of
prosecution.
K. Trial. If proceedings are not dismissed, the case shall proceed upon its
merits and be tried and determined by the Court by the rules of law and
evidence governing the determination of questions of law and facts in
the Superior Court, so far as the same are applicable.
L. Trial by Court; by jury. All cases of contest under § 19-12 of this chapter
shall be fully heard and determined by the Court, without the aid or
intervention of a jury, unless one or both of the parties to the contest
shall claim a trial by jury, and the Court shall, in its judgment, determine
that it is a case which, under the Constitution and laws of this state, the
party or parties are entitled to a trial by jury. In such case, a jury shall be
empanelled and the cause proceeds according to the rules and practice
of the Court in jury trials.
M. Proof and evidence limited by statement. At the trial of any contest
under § 19-12 of this chapter, the contestant shall be limited in his or her
proof and in the admission of evidence to the witnesses named in the
statement, and the witnesses shall be limited in their testimony to the
facts set forth in the statement with respect to which it shall be stated
that they will be expected to testify.
N. Examination of ballots by Court. In the trial of any contested election
under § 19-12 of this chapter, the Court may make an examination of
the ballots given in such election, except that wherever the ballot boxes,
ballots, poll lists, tally sheets, or other books or records pertaining to
any election, excepting the certificate of election of the officer against
whom the contest may be made, duly signed by the Court constituting
the Board of Canvass and under the seal of court and delivered
according to law, shall have come in any way, legally or illegally, into
the possession, care or custody of any person, officially or otherwise,
who shall have been a candidate and voted for upon the same official
ballot as a candidate of the same political party as the contestant,
no such ballot boxes, poll lists, tally sheets or other books or records
pertaining to the said election, excepting the certificate of election, shall
be offered in evidence in any contest begun or prosecuted under the
provisions hereof, and the Court may make and enforce by attachment
all necessary orders to obtain possession of the same.
O. Judgment.
(1) After hearing the allegations and proofs in the cause, the Court shall
render judgment (in accordance with the verdict of the jury, if a
jury shall have tried the cause) either confirming or annulling such
election altogether.
§ 19-12 ELSMERE CODE § 19-12
1:28
(2) If it appears by the judgment of the Court or the verdict of the jury
(if there be a jury) that any other person than the one whose election
is contested received the highest number of legal votes, judgment
shall be rendered declaring such person duly elected.
(3) When the person whose election is contested is proved to be
ineligible to the office, judgment shall be rendered declaring the
election void and the office vacant, and such proceedings shall then
be had as in vacancies happening from any other cause. When
it shall appear that two persons have received an equal number
of legal votes for the same office, the provisions of law for the
settlement of such cases shall prevail, if there be any such provision;
if there be none, then the office shall be adjudged and declared
vacant, and such proceedings shall then be had as in vacancies
happening from any other cause.
P. Costs.
(1) Costs in all cases under § 19-12 shall be awarded against the
unsuccessful party to the contest.
(2) Charges for costs shall be as near as possible to the charges for
similar services in other cases tried in the Superior Court.
(3) Execution may issue to collect costs.

date and time provided for withdraw of nomination in § 19-5D(1) of this
chapter, only one candidate has filed for a particular council district or
for a particular office that is voted upon at large, neither the candidate
nor the particular office shall appear on the official ballot of the Biennial
Town Election. These unopposed candidates shall be deemed to have
been elected to the office to which they filed.
B. Cancellation of the biennial election. If upon the expiration of the date
and time provided for withdraw of nomination in § 19-5D(1) of this
chapter, only one candidate has filed for each particular council district

H. Counting procedure for absentee ballots. At any time between the opening and the
closing of the polls on an election day, absentee election judges selected by Town
of Elsmere's Board of Elections shall count absentee ballots at a properly noticed
public meeting in the Town of Elsmere's offices or at the place of the election, at
the Town of Elsmere's discretion, in accordance with the procedures set out below.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, at the discretion of the Town of
Elsmere, the Board of Elections may itself act as the absentee election judges.
(1) The Town of Elsmere's Board of Elections shall appoint a sufficient number
of teams of absentee election judges, each consisting of an odd number of
electors, to open and tally the absentee ballots before the close of the polls.
The Board of Elections shall be responsible for deciding all challenges and
overseeing the process.
(2) The Town of Elsmere shall provide a list of persons who have returned
absentee ballots for review by the public and challengers at the meeting.
Challenges must be made prior to the opening of the ballot envelope for the
voter being challenged.
(3) If a person has challenged an absentee voter as provided in § 19-10C(5) of this
chapter, an absentee election judge shall give that person's ballot envelope
to the Board of Elections who shall then hear the evidence and decide the
challenge. If the Board of Elections upholds the challenge, the Chairperson
shall write the word "CHALLENGED" on the ballot envelope, the reason for
the challenge and then sign the Chairperson's own name. When the challenge
is denied, the ballot envelope shall be returned to the team to be opened and
counted. The Board of Elections, after the close of the polls, shall seal the
ballot envelopes for all voters who were successfully challenged in a carrier
envelope along with a log sheet showing the serial number of the carrier
envelope.
(4) Where absentee ballots have been prepared for counting in advance of the
opening of the polls in accordance with § 19-14I of this chapter and are
in a carrier envelope, the absentee election judges, upon opening a carrier
envelope, shall verify that the serial number on the log sheet is the same as the
serial number on the carrier envelope. If the numbers are not the same, the
judges shall report the discrepancy to the Board of Elections and then follow
the instructions of the Board regarding that carrier envelope. If there are no
discrepancies or the discrepancy has been resolved, the team shall remove the
ballots from the carrier envelope.
(5) Where the ballots are in the ballot envelopes, a team of absentee election
judges shall:
(a) Check the ballot envelopes against the list of absentee voters. The teams
shall not process any ballot envelopes that the Town of Elsmere has not
listed as returned on the list of absentee voters until the discrepancy has
been resolved to the Board of Elections' satisfaction.
(b) Reject ballot envelopes that the voter did not sign or seal, or for a voter
who is known to be dead. An absentee election judge shall print the word
"REJECTED" and the reason for the rejection on the front of the ballot
envelope and then at least two of the absentee elections judges shall initial
beside the entry.
(c) Open each ballot envelope in such a manner as not to deface or destroy
the self-administered affidavit thereon or the absentee ballot enclosed and
§ 19-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 19-14
1:33
then remove the ballot in such manner as to avoid seeing the markings
thereon from the ballot envelope. If there is no ballot in the ballot envelope
or if there is more than one ballot in a ballot envelope, an absentee election
judge shall write the word "REJECTED" and the reason for the rejection
on the front of the ballot envelope and then at least two absentee elections
judges shall initial beside the entries. In the case where there was more
than one ballot in a ballot envelope, the team shall put the ballots back into
the ballot envelope.
(d) Once an absentee ballot judge has removed a ballot from a ballot envelope,
the judge shall put it face down on the table without examining it. The
team shall open ballot envelopes until they have a sufficient number
of ballots and ballot envelopes to fill a carrier envelope, create a
predetermined batch, or they have opened all of the ballot envelopes for
a Town of Elsmere election district or the election, whichever occurs first.
The team shall then shuffle the ballots and then proceed to tally the votes
for that group of ballots.
(6) The team of absentee election judges shall then tally the votes for a group of
ballots on absentee vote tally sheets with one person reading the votes and two
others tallying the votes on separate absentee vote tally sheets. Once the team
has tallied a group of ballots, they shall verify that the results on both absentee
vote tally sheets are the same. If the results are not the same, the team shall
retally the votes until the result is the same. During the tally process, the
team shall attempt to determine the voters' intent pursuant to § 19-11 of this
chapter in the event that a voter did not mark the ballot as instructed.
(7) Once a team has tallied the absentee votes for a group of ballots, the members
shall sign both copies of the absentee vote tally sheet and then put the voted
ballots, rejected ballots, ballot envelopes, and one copy of the absentee vote
tally sheet into a carrier envelope. The team shall then complete the log sheet
showing the serial number of the carrier envelope, put the log sheet into the
carrier envelope and then seal the carrier envelope. The team shall then give
the carrier envelope and the second copy of the absentee vote tally sheet to
the Board of Elections.
(8) Upon receipt of a carrier envelope and the second copy of the absentee vote
tally sheet for that carrier envelope, the Board of Elections shall:
(a) Put the carrier envelope in a secure location until such time as it is needed
for a recount, legal action, or is to be destroyed as provided in this chapter;
and
(b) Record the results from the absentee vote tally sheet onto a master
absentee vote tally sheet for the election. After the Board of Elections
has received all of the absentee vote tally sheets and has entered the
results for each candidate on the master absentee vote tally sheet, the
Board shall total the votes for each candidate and then, after the polls have
closed, enter the results on the vote tabulation for the election. The Board
of Elections shall then seal the absentee vote tally sheet, or sheets, in a
carrier envelope along with a log sheet showing the serial number of the
carrier envelope.
(9) Ballot envelopes received after the ballots have been counted, or the ballots
for a specific Town of Elsmere election district have been counted, shall be
opened and tallied in accordance with the above procedure except that they all
§ 19-14 ELSMERE CODE § 19-14
1:34
shall be sealed in one or more carrier envelopes, as necessary, after the polls
have closed.
(10) The teams shall repeat the above process as many times as necessary in order
to count the absentee ballots.
(11) The Town of Elsmere shall establish a procedure to insure that persons who
voted by absentee ballot shall not be permitted to vote at a polling place on
the day of the election.
(12) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, when the number of
absentee ballots returned to the Town of Elsmere is less than five, the Town
of Elsmere may develop a counting procedure protective of the secrecy of the
ballot.
I. Preparing absentee ballots to be counted. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, the Town of Elsmere Board of Elections may open absentee ballot
envelopes in a public meeting in order to prepare them to be counted. Such meeting
shall take place, upon proper notice, at any time between 8:00 a.m. of the day
prior to the election and up to one hour before the polls are scheduled to open.
The Town of Elsmere shall notify each candidate on the ballot that they may have
challengers at the meeting during which the Board of Elections opens the absentee
ballots. At such meeting, the Board of Elections shall act in accordance with the
same procedures as set out in § 19-14H(1), (2), (3) and (5)(a) through (d) of this
chapter inclusive, with the exception that the absentee ballot judges shall not
proceed to tally the votes for any group of ballots, but shall then secure such ballots,
ballot envelopes, and any rejected ballot envelopes in a carrier envelope along
with the log sheet showing the serial number of the log sheet. The absentee ballot
judges shall then seal the carrier envelope, or envelopes, and deliver it/them to the
Board of Elections. The Board of Elections shall then secure the carrier envelope,
or envelopes, in locked cabinets until opened at a subsequent public meeting to
tally the ballots on the day of the election in accordance with § 19-14H(4) and (6)
through (10) of this chapter.
J. Carrier envelope specifications; carrier envelopes as ballot boxes.
(1) The Town of Elsmere shall purchase envelopes to be used as carrier envelopes,

1:35
move them, in a secure fashion, to the location where the carrier envelopes will
be opened and the votes inside inspected.
(5) Upon completion of any inspection of votes pursuant to this subsection,
absentee ballots shall be returned to the carrier envelopes from which they
were removed and the carrier envelopes shall be:
(a) Resealed in a secure manner or shall be placed in another security
envelope, for the purposes of securely protecting the contents thereof from
tampering, removal, or substitution without detection; and

not be opened but shall instead be endorsed thereon as, "REJECTED," giving

other property of whatever kind in his possession belonging to the Town.

medical or medicinal benefit to the animal's owner or a member of
his/her family residing in the residence and that harboring the animal
would not adversely affect the general value of property within the area,
nor adversely affect the right of other property owners to the safe and
comfortable enjoyment of their property, the Town Manager may issue
an exemption to § 71-11 of this chapter.
D. If the Town Manager decides to issue an exemption he may make the
issuance of the exemption contingent upon any terms, restrictions or
conditions he feels appropriate.

General Provisions
§ 102-1. Findings.
A. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified
special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the Town of Elsmere.
Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare. Development that is inadequately elevated, improperly
floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also
contributes to the flood loss.
B. The Town of Elsmere, by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements
of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for
participation in the program on December 31, 1976. Subsequent to that
date or the initial effective date of the Town of Elsmere Flood Insurance
Rate Map, all development and new construction, as defined herein,

new construction, and substantial improvements subsequent to the
effective date of these regulations shall be compliant with these

and general welfare, and to:
A. Protect human life, health and welfare;
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
C. Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal
systems;
D. Maintain natural drainage;
E. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction
of development in areas subject to flooding;
F. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
G. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
H. Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges;
I. Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas
should assume responsibility for their actions;
J. Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
K. Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
§ 102-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 102-2
1:121
L. Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the floodplain;
M. Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and

Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44
CFR 59.22.

which establish base flood elevations, delineate one-hundred-year
floodplains, floodways or other areas of special flood hazard.
(4) The Town of Elsmere may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas should be delineated and
adopted on a Local Flood Hazard Map using best available
topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of
record, historic high-water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
(5) Where field-surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations
are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas
not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a flood hazard map,
the area shall be considered as a special flood hazard area.
B. Maps and studies that establish special flood hazard areas are on file
at the Town of Elsmere Code Enforcement Office, located at 11 Poplar
Avenue, Elsmere, Delaware 19805.
§ 102-5. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing
ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances or
building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject
to such interests shall also be governed by these regulations.
§ 102-2 ELSMERE CODE § 102-6
1:122
§ 102-6. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
A. Considered as minimum requirements;
B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes; and
D. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence, where more
restrictive.
§ 102-7. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard
areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part
of the Town of Elsmere, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in
§ 102-4.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The date of issuance of permits for new
construction and substantial improvements, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual
start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the

would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start
of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
§ 102-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 102-8
1:129
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified
prior to the application for a development permit by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in these regulations
is presumed to be in violation until such time that documentation is
provided.

a Letter of Map Revision shall be provided.
§ 102-16. Flood Insurance Rate Map use and interpretation.
The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as
to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries,
and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and
interpretation of special flood hazard maps and data:
A. In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation
and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA
has not identified special flood hazard areas, any other flood hazard
data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed
and reasonably used. When a Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map
has been provided by FEMA to identify base flood elevation where such
elevations were not previously shown, the base flood elevations on the
Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be used.
B. Special flood hazard area delineations, base flood elevations, and
floodway boundaries on FEMA maps and in FEMA studies shall take
precedence over delineations, base flood elevations, and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced special flood
hazard area, reduced floodway width and/or lower base flood elevations.
C. Other sources of data shall be reasonably used, with the approval of the
Floodplain Administrator, if they show increased base flood elevations
and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps and
studies.
D. Where field-surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations are
below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special
flood hazard on a flood hazard map, the area shall be considered as a
special flood hazard area.

Variances
§ 102-30. Variance authorization and requirements.
The Town of Elsmere Board of Adjustment shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the requirements of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot
or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
A. Application for a variance.
(1) Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall submit an application for a variance to the Floodplain
Administrator.
(2) At a minimum, such application shall contain the following
information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the
existing use; description of the proposed use; location of the
floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the
variance request. Each variance application shall specifically
address each of the considerations in § 102-30B and the limitations
and conditions of § 102-30C.
B. Considerations for variances. In considering variance applications, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, requirements specified in other sections
of these regulations, and the following factors:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents (if
applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
development to the community.
(5) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosion
damage.
(6) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable, or if the facility is a functionally dependent use.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
§ 102-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 102-30
1:147
(11) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.
C. Limitations for variances.
(1) An affirmative decision on a variance request shall only be issued
upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause. A good and sufficient
cause is one that deals solely with the physical characteristics
of the property and cannot be based on the character of the
planned construction or substantial improvement, the personal
characteristics of the owner or inhabitants, or local provisions
that regulate standards other than health and public safety
standards.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.
(c) Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of
these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to
the applicant.
(d) A determination that the granting of a variance for development
within any designated floodway, or special flood hazard area with
base flood elevations but no floodway, will not result in increased
flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations.
(e) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws.
(f) A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
(g) A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(2) Upon consideration of the individual circumstances, the limitations
and conditions, and the purposes of these regulations, the Board
of Adjustment may attach such conditions to variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
(3) The Board of Adjustment shall notify, in writing, any applicant to
whom a variance is granted for a building or structure with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation that the variance is to
the floodplain management requirements of these regulations only,
and that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk.

privately owned property viewable from a public or quasi-public
place, the Town Manager shall be authorized to use public funds
for the removal of the graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of
the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the
painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that where
the graffiti is located, unless the Town Manager, or his/her designee,
determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be
repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement
to the neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner
or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or
repairing the more extensive area.
(2) Right of entry on private property.
§ 110-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 110-7
1:155

a public entity other than the Town for the purpose of graffiti
removal the Town shall attempt to secure the consent of the
property owner or responsible party and a release of the Town
from liability for property damage or personal injury.
(b) If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the
offending graffiti within the time specified by this chapter, or

offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party
has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the Town
and consistent with the terms of this section, the Town shall
commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the
graffiti removal according to the provisions specified below.
D. Abatement and cost recovery proceedings.

Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall provide the property
owner of record and the party responsible for the maintenance
of the property, if a person different from the owner, not less
than 48 hours' notice of the Town's intent to hold a due process
hearing at which the property owner or responsible party shall
be entitled to present evidence and argue that the property does
not constitute a public nuisance.
(b) Notice shall be served by personal notice or telephonic
conversation to the owner or current occupant of the property. If
the owner of record cannot be contacted after a diligent search,
the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a
conspicuous place upon the property for a period of seven days.
(2) Determination of Hearing Officer. The determination of the Hearing
Officer after the due process hearing shall be final. If, after the
due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the owner or
the responsible party or their respective agents, the Hearing Officer
determines that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public
or quasi-public place, the Hearing Officer shall give written notice
in an abatement order that, unless the graffiti is removed within 72
hours, the Town shall enter upon the property, cause the removal,
painting over (in such color as shall meet with the approval of the
Hearing Officer), or such other abatement thereof as the Hearing
Officer determines appropriate, and shall provide the owner and the
responsible party thereafter with an accounting of the costs of the
abatement effort on a full cost recovery basis.
(3) Abatement efforts. Not sooner than the time specified in the order of
the Hearing Officer, the Town Manager, or the designee of the Town
Manager, shall implement the eradication order and shall provide
an accounting to the owner and the responsible party of the costs
thereof.

(a) The owner or responsible party may request a cost hearing
before the Hearing Officer on the abatement accounting, and
§ 110-7 ELSMERE CODE § 110-7
1:156
appropriate due process must be extended to the owner or
responsible party. If, following the cost hearing or, if no hearing
is requested, after the implementation of the abatement order,
the Hearing Officer determines that all or a portion of the costs
is appropriately chargeable to the abatement effort, the total
amount set forth in the abatement accounting, or an amount
thereof determined as appropriate by the Hearing Officer, shall
be due and payable by the owner or responsible party within 30
days.
(b) Any amount of abatement charges assessed by the Hearing
Officer that are less than the total amount set forth in the
abatement accounting shall be explained by written letter from
the Hearing Officer to the Mayor and Council.
§ 110-8. Lien.
As to such property where the responsible party is the property owner, if all
or any portion of the assessed abatement charges remaining unpaid after 30
days, the portion thereof that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien on the
property that was the subject of the abatement effort. The Town Manager
shall authorize the Town Attorney to proceed with any appropriate legal
action(s) to accomplish the filing of a lien against the property.
§ 110-9. Design of potential graffiti-attracting surfaces.
Whenever an applicant for design review approval, a conditional use permit,

other form of development or building permit is received, and the proposed

persons in like businesses, professions, pursuits or callings or by
considering other facts which may be available to the Town Manager or

ARTICLE III
Registration of Home Occupations
[Adopted 3-10-2016 by Ord. No. 612]
§ 131-32. Purpose.
The regulations relating to the registration of certain home occupations are
designed to protect and maintain the residential character of established
neighborhoods while recognizing that certain professional and limited
business activities have traditionally been performed in the home. This
article recognizes that when properly limited and regulated such activities
can be performed in a residential structure without changing the character
of either the neighborhood or the structure.
§ 131-33. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
HOME OCCUPATION  A business, profession, occupation or trade
conducted for gain or support entirely within a residential building or a
structure accessory thereto, which is incidental and secondary to the use
of such building for dwelling purposes and which does not change the
essential residential character of such building.
IMMEDIATE FAMILY  For the purpose of this article, spouse, mother,
father, guardian, child, sister, brother, grandparent, grandchild, plus the
various combinations of half, step, in-law and adopted relationships that can
be derived from those named.
§ 131-34. General requirements; restrictions.
A home occupation, as defined in § 131-33, may be permitted so long as
such business conforms to the following standards:
A. The home occupation use shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to
the use of the premises for residential purposes;
B. No alteration of the principal residential building shall be made which
changes the character and appearance thereof as a dwelling;
C. The home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the principal
dwelling unit or within an accessory structure, and in no event shall
such use be apparent from any public way. The area used for the
home occupations shall not exceed 25% of the gross floor area of the
residence;
D. There shall be no outdoor operations, storage or display of products,
materials, goods, supplies or equipment associated with the home
occupation;
E. Home occupations shall not be conducted in such a manner as to
produce noise, dust, vibration, glare, smoke, odor, electrical
interference, fire hazard, traffic or any other nuisance not typically
experienced in the zoning district where the property is located;
§ 131-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 131-34
1:197
F. Deliveries shall not exceed those normally and reasonably occurring
from a residence and shall not exceed more than an average of one truck
delivery per day which shall only occur between the hours of 7:00 a.m.
and 9:00 p.m., provided that no delivery shall be made via a combination
vehicle (for example, a vehicle commonly known as a eighteen-wheeler);
G. Home occupations that attract customers or clients to the premises shall
not be allowed under this article and must comply with the special
exception use of a home occupation in accordance with Town of Elsmere
Code Chapter 225 and/or home occupations that attract customers or
clients to the premises shall be permitted and exempt from all other
parking regulations provided that the frequency and consistency of
traffic to and from the site in relation to the home occupation does
not interfere with the community's comfort, safety, or enjoyment of the
neighborhood around the subject property as a residential area or create
a visual or traffic annoyance to persons of normal sensibilities such
that a public nuisance is created. High-volume visits and traffic to and
from the site during the hours of 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. is evidence
that the home occupation is not indistinguishable from other dwellings
and therefore creates a public nuisance in the residential neighborhood;
[Amended 6-9-2016 by Ord. No. 615]
H. No one may be employed in the home occupation other than members
of the immediate family of the owner or primary person renting the
property;
I. Home occupations do not include garage sales and yard sales;
J. If the property is being used solely as a mailing address for a
professional license the owner(s) possesses, and no business is being
conducted on the premises and no visitors, phone calls, or advertising is
conducted on the premises, no fee will be required. [Added 6-9-2016
by Ord. No. 615]
§ 131-35. Registration requirements.
No home occupations shall operate within the corporate limits of the Town
of Elsmere without first registering the home occupation with the Town and
obtaining a home occupation permit by completing the registration form
furnished by the Town Manager or his or her designee or such other person
as the Council may hereafter designate and paying an annual registration
fee in the sum of $50.
A. Application shall be made by the legal occupant of the residence. In such
case in which application is not made by the legal property owner, the
property owner shall submit an affidavit acknowledging the application
for a home occupation;
B. Permits for a home occupation shall be granted to a designated person
who resides at the residential address and are nontransferable from
person to person or address to address. The address must be the
applicant's primary residence;
C. The Town Manager may revoke any home occupation permit for
noncompliance with any of the provisions of this chapter or if the
property has been deemed a public nuisance. If the permit is revoked,
such home occupation use shall be terminated immediately;
§ 131-34 ELSMERE CODE § 131-35
1:198
D. Home occupations shall comply with all local, state or federal
regulations pertinent to the activity pursued, and the requirements of
or permission granted by this article shall not be construed as an
exemption from such regulations. Proof of compliance must be
submitted at the time of application;
E. All annual home occupation registrations required by this article shall
be for the period of November 1 of one year to October 31 of the next
ensuing year;
F. Whenever a home occupation permit has been issued, the person(s)
conducting business at the location shall not need to obtain a business
license in order to conduct business at the permitted location.
§ 131-36. Delinquencies; violations and penalties.
A. Delinquency dates. All registration fees required by this article shall be
deemed delinquent if not paid on or before the close of business on the
first day of November of each year.
B. Penalties. Whenever the permit fee required by this article is not paid on
or before the delinquency date, in addition to the permit fee a penalty
equal to 50% of the amount of the permit fee shall be imposed and due
immediately. Additionally, any permit fee and/or penalty required by this
article which remains unpaid at the close of business on the first day
of December of each year shall be treated as if the person required to
obtain the permit had failed to obtain the licenses and therefore shall be
subject to the penalties contained in § 131-36C and D of this article.
C. Failure to obtain license.
(1) Anyone required to register under this article who conducts business
prior to obtaining the required home occupation permit shall be
fined not less than $300 nor more than $500 and shall immediately
cease and desist from conducting business until he/she has obtained
the proper permit.
(2) Each day a person continues to conduct or engage in any business,
profession, occupation or trade as a home occupation without a valid
home occupation permit shall constitute and be a separate offense
and punishable as such.
D. Criminal penalties. No person shall conduct or engage in any business,
profession, occupation or trade as a home occupation as defined by or
coming within the provisions of this article, without first obtaining a
permit, as required by this article. No person having been permitted
and being delinquent in the payment of the permit fee shall continue
to conduct or engage in the business, profession, occupation or trade
for which he or she may have been licensed without first removing
such delinquency. Each day's operation, conducting or engaging in any
business, profession, occupation or trade in violation of this article shall
constitute and be a separate offense and punishable as such. The
individuals composing any firm, partnership or association and each of
them, and the president, managing officer and the directors and each
or any of them of any corporation violating this article shall, for each
and every offense, be deemed guilty of violating this article and shall
be punishable as provided herein. Every person violating any provision
§ 131-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 131-36
1:199
of this article shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon
conviction thereof before a court of competent jurisdiction, besides
being liable for the payment of said license fee, together with all
penalties, shall forfeit and pay a fine of not less than $300 nor more than
$500 for each such offense.
§ 131-37. Effective date.
The provisions of this article shall become effective March 31, 2016. All
existing home occupations are required to register within 60 days of the
effective date of this article. The fee for the first home occupation
registration period of March 31, 2016, through October 31, 2016, shall be
$25.

The Mayor and Council finds and determines that the existence of buildings,
structures, properties and open lots which are repeatedly in violation of
or the subject of repeated neighborhood complaints concerning violations
of the Property Maintenance Code, and the General Code of the Town of
Elsmere, can have a devastating impact upon the use of such property
as well as surrounding properties and upon the surrounding community,
including the promotion of illegal activities, the threat to the public health,
safety and welfare, the interference in the community's quality of life as well
as the value of surrounding properties, and, therefore, constitute public
nuisances that endanger the health, safety and general welfare of the
people of the Town of Elsmere and to the businesses thereof and visitors
thereto.

ARTICLE II
Public Nuisance Receivership
[Adopted 3-9-2017 by Ord. No. 626]
§ 145-8. Findings.
The Mayor and Council finds and determines that a system of housing
receivership is a necessary tool to address public nuisances as defined
in § 145-2 of this chapter, particularly in those instances in which,
notwithstanding reliance upon provisions of Article I of this chapter and
other provisions of this code, the public nuisance persists.
§ 145-9. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings respectively ascribed to them in Article I of this chapter and
as follows:
ABANDONED PROPERTY  The definition of abandoned property in
Elsmere Code § 209-13 shall apply.
TOWN MANAGER  The Town Manager of Elsmere, or his or her designee
as applicable.
§ 145-10. Unsafe structures.
A. Any structure or part of a structure found to be abandoned, unsafe or
unfit for human habitation or other authorized use must be rehabilitated
or, as permitted or required by the Town Manager, demolished. A
structure may be unsafe or unfit for human habitation or other
authorized use because of:
(1) Conditions constituting a fire hazard or conditions of damage, decay,
dilapidation, obsolescence, abandonment, vacancy, insanitation, or
vermin or rodent infestation that constitute a hazard to the health,
welfare, or safety of occupants or the public;
(2) Lack of sanitation, illumination, ventilation, heating, plumbing,
exitways, fire protection, utilities, or other facilities adequate to
protect the health, welfare, or safety of occupants or the public; or
(3) Conditions that are so unsafe, insanitary, overcrowded, improper in
use or occupancy, or otherwise dangerous to life, health, welfare, or
safety as to create a hazard to occupants or the public.
B. Whenever the Town Manager determines all or any part of an occupied
structure to be unsafe or unfit for human habitation or other authorized
use:
(1) The Town Manager may post an order requiring the structure or
affected part to be vacated, and take necessary steps to remove
occupants who fail or refuse to vacate.
(2) Once vacated, the structure or affected part may not be reoccupied
until it is rehabilitated to comply with all applicable codes and
ordinances, and the Town Manager has issued an occupancy permit.
§ 145-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 145-10
1:215
(3) Pending rehabilitation, the structure must be kept secure against
casual entry and the premises kept free of occupants, litter, high
grass, and weeds.
C. Any structure or part of a structure that has been left unoccupied
without removing appliances or portable equipment or furniture and
without disconnecting utility service must be safeguarded by closing and
securely locking all windows, doors, and other openings.
D. Required safeguarding. Every abandoned property must be cleaned,
closed, and safeguarded as follows:
(1) Before the structure is closed and secured, all litter, trash, and other
debris must be removed from the premises.
(2) All windows, doors, and other openings must be closed, securely
locked, and, if readily accessible, boarded up with substantial
material, including masonry, approved by the Town Manager. The
Town Manager may require windows facing streets to be boarded
with lexan, vinyl, or similar material, protected by security grills, or
both.
(3) As long as the structure remains unrehabilitated, it must be kept
boarded, the premises must be conspicuously posted against
trespass, and the premises must be kept free of occupants, litter,
trash, debris, high grass, and weeds at all times.
(4) Boarding, posting, and cleaning, however, do not relieve the owner
of responsibility to demolish or to repair and maintain the property
in conformity with this article.
(5) The structure may not be reoccupied until the Town Manager has
issued an occupancy permit.
E. Emergency condition. An abandoned property that is not kept boarded
and free from accumulations of debris and high vegetation or that, in
the opinion of the Town Manager, is so dangerously unsound or so
deteriorated that rehabilitation is not feasible, constitutes an emergency
condition that imminently threatens the public health and safety and
requires immediate resolution.
F. Rehabilitation, demolition, and stabilization. Except as otherwise
authorized or required under this article, a structure found to be an
abandoned property, or unsafe or unfit for human habitation or other
authorized use must be rehabilitated and an occupancy permit obtained.
(1) Permitted demolition. On timely appeal of an order to rehabilitate,
the Town Manager may permit an owner to demolish an unsafe
structure instead of rehabilitating it if, in the Town Manager's
opinion, demolition is not detrimental to the immediate
neighborhood.
(2) Required demolition. The Town Manager may order the immediate
demolition of any unsafe structure that, in the Town Manager's
opinion, is either so dangerously unsound or so deteriorated that
rehabilitation is not feasible.
(3) Rescission of demolition order. The Town Manager may rescind or
modify a demolition order if the owner demonstrates the financial
ability and requisite expertise to rehabilitate the structure within a
reasonable time, as determined by the Town Manager, and agrees to
§ 145-10 ELSMERE CODE § 145-10
1:216
comply with a specified timetable. Failure to comply with an agreed
timetable reinstates the demolition order.
(4) Stabilization. The Town Manager may permit or order an interim
stabilization of an unsafe structure pending its rehabilitation.
G. Vacant lot maintenance. When a structure has been demolished under

provisions of this article.
B. Photographs of dangerous conditions. In all emergencies, if it is practical

photographed before any demolition or other work or operation is begun
to eliminate the dangerous or unsafe condition.
C. When necessary for the public safety, the Town Manager may
temporarily close adjacent structures and adjacent sidewalks, streets,
and other public ways and prohibit them from being used.

(1) The Town Manager enforces any provision of this article, including,
but not limited to: the elimination of any safety, health, or fire

A. In general. If any land or structure becomes unsafe or dangerous to
public health or safety, the Town Manager may condemn the land,
structure, or equipment and issue a condemnation notice of this article.
The issuance of a violation notice is not a prerequisite for the
condemnation of real property.
B. Posting notice. If the Town Manager condemns any land or structure,
the Town Manager must cause a notice to be conspicuously displayed on
the condemned land, structure, or equipment. The notice must:
(1) Be at least 24 inches wide and eight inches high;

C. Emergencies. In case of an emergency where life or property may be in
immediate danger, the Town Manager need not post the property and
may proceed in accordance with § 145-11 of this article.
D. Vacating condemned property. A notice posted under Subsection B is
deemed to be sufficient warning to all occupants of the condemned
property to leave immediately. If any occupant fails to vacate the
§ 145-12 ELSMERE CODE § 145-13
1:218
property immediately after the notice is posted, the Town Manager may
take whatever action is proper and expedient to remove that occupant.

Town Manager may:
(1) Take any action authorized under § 145-13; or

appointment of a receiver.
F. Status of condemned property. After property has been condemned
and posted in accordance with this § 145-13, that property remains
condemned and may not be occupied or used again until the Town
Manager declares the property safe for occupancy or use and has
removed the condemnation.
G. Order to demolish. If, in the Town Manager's opinion, a structure is
so dangerously unsound or so deteriorated that rehabilitation is not
feasible, the condemnation notice may order the owner to demolish the
structure immediately.
H. Removal of unsafe conditions. Any time after notice has been posted
in accordance with this § 145-13, the Town Manager may demolish,
move, alter, repair, rehabilitate, rebuild, reconstruct, or take any other
appropriate action to eliminate or make safe and secure any dangerous
or unsafe condition.
§ 145-14. Abandoned property receiver.
A. Scope. This § 145-14 applies to an abandoned or condemned property.
B. In general. The Town Manager may petition a Delaware court of
competent jurisdiction for appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate
an abandoned or condemned property, to demolish it, or to sell it to
a qualified buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this § 145-14, the
receiver may be any person.
C. Contents of petition. In seeking the appointment of a receiver, the Town
Managers must include in the petition:
(1) A copy of the original abandoned property or condemned property
notice or order; and
(2) A verified pleading that avers that the property is abandoned or
condemned and required rehabilitation or demolition has not been
completed, and identifies and states the qualifications of the
proposed receiver, if other than the Town Manager.
D. Named respondents. The petition for appointment of receiver must
name as respondents:
(1) The owner of the property.
(2) Any lien holder of record.
E. Notice to judgment creditors and lien holders. After filing the petition
but before seeking finalization of the appointment of a receiver, the
Town Manager must give notice of the pendency and nature of the
proceedings by regular and certified mail to the last-known addresses of
all judgment creditors and lien holders with a recorded interest in the
property, subject to the following exceptions:
(1) This notice is not required for respondents named under § 145-14
that have been served with process under Delaware law.
§ 145-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 145-14
1:219
(2) The Town Manager is not required to send notices to any creditor or
lien holder whose interest in the property is unrecorded.
F. Appointment of receiver. If no qualified person with an ownership
interest requests appointment to rehabilitate or demolish the property,
or if an appointee is dismissed, the Town Manager must then request
that the court appoint a receiver of the property for the purpose of
rehabilitating and managing the property, demolishing the property, or
selling it to a qualified buyer, subject to the following:
(1) Parties divested of authority. On appointment of a receiver to
rehabilitate, demolish, or sell the property, all parties are divested
of any authority to act with respect to that property.
(2) Penalties. Any party who takes any step to rehabilitate, demolish, or
sell the property is subject to the penalties for contempt.
(3) Receiver not responsible to maintain or protect the property. A
receiver appointed to rehabilitate, demolish, or sell a vacant
building has no duty to, and is not personally liable for failing to,
maintain the property or protect the property from casualty or loss.
G. Powers of receiver appointed to rehabilitate or demolish. The Town
Manager shall seek from the court such authority for the receiver that,
in addition to all necessary and customary powers, includes the right of
possession with authority to:
(1) Contract for necessary labor and supplies for rehabilitation or
demolition;
(2) Borrow money for rehabilitation or demolition from an approved
lending institution or through a government agency or program,
using the receiver's lien against the property as security;
(3) Manage the property after rehabilitation, with all the powers of a
landlord, for a period of up to two years and apply the rent received
to current operating expenses and to repayment of outstanding
rehabilitation expenses; and
(4) Foreclose on the receiver's lien or accept a deed in lieu of
foreclosure.
H. Powers of receiver appointed to sell. The Town Manager shall seek from
the court such authority for the receiver that, in addition to all necessary
and customary powers, includes the right for the receiver to sell the
property to the high bidder at public auction, following all relevant
laws and notice requirements in Delaware, or to sell the property in a
private sale if the property fails to sell at public auction, subject to the
following:
(1) Buyer qualifications. Before any sale, the applicants to bid in a
public sale or the proposed buyer in a private sale must demonstrate
the ability and experience needed to rehabilitate the property within
a reasonable time.
(2) Application fee. The receiver may charge a reasonable fee to
applicants in connection with the application to bid at a public sale
or in connection with the solicitation of offers for a private sale.
(3) Application of sale proceeds. After deducting the expenses of the
sale, the amount of outstanding taxes and other government
assessments, and the amount of the receiver's lien, the receiver
§ 145-14 ELSMERE CODE § 145-14
1:220
must apply any remaining proceeds of the sale, first to the
petitioner's costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's
fees, and then to the liens against the property in order of priority.
I. Tenure of receiver appointed to rehabilitate. The Town Manager must
seek court approval that the tenure of a receiver appointed to
rehabilitate a vacant building may extend no longer than two years after
rehabilitation, and that after rehabilitation, any party to the receivership
may file a motion to dismiss the receiver on payment of the receiver's
outstanding costs, fees, and expenses.
J. Final accounting. The Town Manager shall request the court require
that at the end of the receiver's tenure the receiver file a final
accounting with the court.
K. Receiver's lien for costs, etc. Any costs or fees incurred by the Town
Manager or the receiver are a lien against the property in accordance
with § 145-12 of this article. The receiver's lien has priority over all
other liens and encumbrances, except taxes or other government
assessments as required by Delaware law. The receiver must allow the
Town Manager's costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's
fees, to be paid to the extent that the proceeds of the sale permit.
L. Foreclosure of lien. A receiver may foreclose on the lien by a sale of
the property at public auction, following one public notice and notice
to interested parties in the manner of a mortgage foreclosure. After
deducting the expenses of the sale, the receiver must apply the
proceeds of the sale to the liens against the property, in order of priority.
In lieu of foreclosure, and only if the receiver has rehabilitated the
property, an owner may pay the receiver's costs, fees, including
attorney's fees, and expenses or may transfer all ownership in the
property to either the receiver or an agreed-on third party for an amount
agreed to by all parties to the receivership as being the property's fair
market value.
M. Transfer on sale. The Town Manager shall request the court to require,
following court ratification of a sale, that the receiver sign a deed
conveying title to the buyer, free and clear of all liens, judgments, and
other encumbrances. The Town Manager shall also request the court to
require, upon court ratification of the sale, that any secured interest of a
lien holder or judgment creditor automatically attaches to the proceeds
from the sale, to the extent those proceeds are available.
N. Dismissal. The Town Manager shall request the court to require that,
on sale of the property, the receiver must file with the court a final
accounting, and, at the same time, file a motion with the court to dismiss
the action.

witnesses of the alleged violation of good conduct.

more likely than not the person accused in fact committed the violation,
the Town Manager may:
(1) Attempt to determine if the parties can reach a consensus as to how
the issue can be resolved.
(2) Direct that the parties seek the services of a mediator provided by
many nonprofit organizations in an attempt to resolve the issue(s).
If this method is agreed to and the accused does not attend the
mediation, fails to reach an agreement at the mediation or fails to
follow any agreement made at the mediation, the Town Manager
shall issue a notice to the accused prohibiting him or her from
§ 155-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 155-5
1:233

(1) Placing another person in fear of imminent physical injury by some
movement of a person's body or any instrument.
(2) Intentionally causing inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to any

gesture or display, or addressing abusive language to any person

4,11,16, or 21 of the Delaware Code if committed in a parkland or

§ 155-5 ELSMERE CODE § 155-5
1:234
all of the period of exclusion, such as for work or to attend or
participate in a particular event (without regard to the content of
any speech associated with that event), and any other criterion the
Town Manager determines to be relevant to the determination of
whether or not to grant a waiver.
(4) Notwithstanding the granting of a waiver under this Subsection,
the prohibition will be included for purposes of calculating the
appropriate length of prohibition.
(5) The Town Manager's decision to grant or deny, in whole or in part,
a waiver under this Subsection is at the sole discretion of the Town
Manager, and is not subject to appeal or review.
I. If an appeal of the prohibition is timely filed, the effectiveness of the
prohibition shall be stayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. If the
prohibition is affirmed, the remaining period of exclusion shall be
effective immediately upon the issuance of the decision.
J. If a person is issued a subsequent prohibition while a previous
prohibition is stayed pending appeal (or pending judicial review, should
a court stay the exclusion), the stayed prohibition shall be counted in
determining the appropriate length of the subsequent exclusion. If the
previous prohibition is set aside, the term of the subsequent prohibition
shall be reduced, as if the previous prohibition had not been issued.
If multiple prohibitions issued to a single person for a single park are
simultaneously stayed pending appeal, the effective periods of those
which are affirmed shall run consecutively.
K. No person shall enter or remain in any parkland or recreational area
at any time during which there is in effect a notice of prohibition
issued under this section prohibiting that person from that parkland or
recreational area.

at any time during which there is in effect a notice of prohibition
issued under this section prohibiting that person from that parkland
or recreational area shall be guilty of Trespass in the third degree as
defined by Section 821 of Title 11 of the Delaware Code.

B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Code Enforcement Officers shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If
a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Code Enforcement Officers ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater,
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.
(3) The Town shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Town has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement
agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
(7) If the Town has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the Code Enforcement
Officer is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare
of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
§ 190-10 ELSMERE CODE § 190-11
1:280
§ 190-11. Use of best management practices to prevent, control,
and reduce stormwater pollutants.
The Town requires best management practices for any activity, operation,
or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination
of stormwater, the MS4, or waters of the United States. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of
these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible
for a property or premises which is, or may be, the source of an illicit
discharge may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
§ 190-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 190-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4, or waters
of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure
the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of
such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
Town of Elsmere within three business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
§ 190-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-13
1:281
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five years.
§ 190-14. Enforcement.
A. Notice of violation. Whenever the Town finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation
to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
C. The Town, at its discretion, may file charges in Justice of the Peace (JP)
Court for violating this article of the Town Code. If needed, the Town will
contact DNREC's Office of Community Services' Environmental Crimes
Unit. All of DNREC's environmental officers are certified police officers
with full police powers.
§ 190-15. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received
within 10 days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place
within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision
of the municipal authority or its designee shall be final.
§ 190-16. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 15
days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of
the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
§ 190-13 ELSMERE CODE § 190-17
1:282
§ 190-17. Cost of abatement of violation.
Within 10 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within 10 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely
manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this article shall become liable to the Town by reason of such
violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments and
shall also include per-annum interest on the total amount due, computed on
the basis of the amortized amount outstanding at the rate provided by 6 Del.
C. § 2301.
§ 190-18. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the authorized
enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations
or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
§ 190-19. Compensatory action.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by
this article, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance
at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
§ 190-20. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise

be subject to a criminal penalty of $200 per violation per day and/or
imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed 120 days. The authorized

mortgagee holding the defaulted mortgage from all the requirements of

article must report any change of information contained in the
registration within 10 days of the change.

parcel: [Added 7-11-2013 by Ord. No. 568]
(1) Any prior action which changed the zoning classification; or
(2) A prior rejection of an application to amend the zoning classification.
C. The Building Official shall determine whether or not any proposed
amendment to the Zoning Map is subject to the two-year time restriction
set forth in Subsection B of this section. If the Building Official finds that
the time restriction does apply, no further processing of the application
to amend the Zoning Map shall occur unless the Town Council shall, by
resolution and after public hearing, determine that with respect to such
parcel there is a reasonable basis to believe there has been a substantial
change in the circumstances or conditions affecting the property or in
the proposed use or plans for the use after the time of the prior action
referred to in Subsection B of this section which would justify the change
of zoning classification for such parcel, provided that a determination
with respect to such change shall not be made more than once within the
two-year period specified in Subsection B of this section. A two-thirds
vote of all members of the Town Council shall be required to approve

more than two accessways to any one public highway or street.
Neither of such accessways shall be more than 32 feet in width. The
intent of this section is to encourage the use of common accessways
by two or more permitted highway uses in order to reduce the
number and closeness of access points along the highway and to
encourage the fronting of commercial structures upon a marginal
street, private roadway or similar area and not directly upon a

of a residence zone, an area of not less than 50 feet in width shall be
§ 225-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-20
1:441
set aside as a buffer area and used for no other purpose. Said buffer
area shall be planted with a screen of evergreen shrubs, which in
the opinion of the Planning Commission will be sufficient to preclude
any adverse effect of the use upon adjacent residential properties,
either by reason of objectionable view from the residential property
or from the transmission of headlight glare across the property line.
In addition to the landscape screen, the area shall be adequately
planted with other landscape materials, grass and/or ground cover
to present an attractive appearance. Prior to the issuance of a zoning
permit, the Building Official shall submit the applicant's plans for
such buffer area to the Planning Commission for its approval.

§ 225-30. Variances in Floodplain Districts.
A. The Board of Adjustment shall have original jurisdiction and powers

the granting of variances:
(1) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that:
(a) Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant
and a determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances;
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief;
(c) The Building Official shall notify the applicant in writing that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of the insurance
coverage, and such construction below the base flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in
Subsection B(1)(d) below; and
(d) The Building Official shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in its annual report submitted to the Federal
Insurance Administrator.
(2) No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in
the one-hundred-year-flood elevation.
C. Variances may be issued by the Building Official for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register

Except as otherwise provided in this article, the lawful use of land or
buildings existing at the date of the adoption of this chapter may be
continued although such use or building does not conform to the regulations
specified by this chapter for the zone in which such land or building is
located; provided, however:
A. That no nonconforming lot shall be further reduced in size.
B. That no nonconforming building shall be enlarged, extended or
increased unless such enlargement would tend to reduce the degree of
nonconformance, except that an existing eating and drinking place may
add a covered patio not exceeding 1,400 square feet that is connected to
the nonconforming building.
C. That no nonconforming use may be expanded.
§ 225-32. Abandonment.
A nonconforming use shall be adjudged as abandoned when there occurs a
cessation of any use or activity by an apparent act or failure to act on the
part of the tenant or owner to reinstate such use within a period of three

§ 225-33. Restoration.
If any nonconforming building shall be destroyed by reason of windstorm,
fire, explosion or other act of God or the public enemy to an extent of less
than 50% of the recorded true valuation, then such destruction shall be
deemed partial destruction and the nonconforming building may be rebuilt,
restored or repaired within one year from the date of the destruction. If
such a structure is located within the Floodplain District, the development
regulations cited in § 225-22B shall be utilized to the greatest extent
possible; provided, however, that if such a structure is located within the
floodplain, as that area is defined in § 225-22A(1), then the requirements
of § 225-22B(1)(d), as amended, must be satisfied, notwithstanding the
destruction of less than or more than 50% of the recorded valuation of the
structure. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition any wall, floor or roof which has been declared unsafe by
the Building Official.
§ 225-34. Reversion.
No nonconforming use shall, if once changed into a conforming use, be

§ 225-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-35
1:463
conforming to the requirements of this chapter, and further provided that an
existing eating and drinking place may add a covered patio not exceeding
1,400 square feet that is connected to the nonconforming building. In
the Floodplain District, until a regulatory floodway is designated, no
enlargement or extension or remodeling which would be considered a
substantial enlargement shall be permitted unless the applicant has
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at
any point within the community.
§ 225-36. Zone changes.
Whenever the boundaries of a zone shall be changed so as to transfer an
area from one zone to another of a different classification, the foregoing
provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein or
created thereby.
§ 225-36.1. Nonconforming use permit.
A. Whenever any person with an actual or potential interest in any land or
building that is a nonconforming use as defined in this article shall need
to determine whether a proposed use of such land or building would
be permitted, such person may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a
nonconforming use permit. Any person who obtains a nonconforming use
permit under the procedures provided for by this subsection shall be
entitled to rely upon such permit as a defense to any claim that the use
so permitted violates the Town of Elsmere Zoning Code.
B. The procedures and rights of appeal provided for other proceedings
before the Board of Adjustment under Article VIII of this chapter shall
be equally applicable as far as practical to any determination of an
application for a nonconforming use permit.

considered, the Town Attorney shall be notified of the meeting. The
Attorney shall review the application and facts of the request. He or

the Committee holding the hearing any comments he or she deems
appropriate. [Amended 4-12-2012 by Ord. No. 547]
D. The fee to be paid at the time an application for a nonconforming use
permit is filed shall be $200 for a residential property and $500 for a
commercial property. In addition, all petitions shall provide for a deposit
of $500 at the time of application. Town Attorney's fees related to the
petition will be deducted from this $500. Any remaining balance shall be
returned to the petitioner upon resolution of the petition.

justice done.

respect of which the decision appealed from was made, unless the
officer or committee from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the
Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
with him or the committee, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life

notices of such hearing shall be mailed to every civic association or
association of residents in the Town which shall have registered its

shall first have been submitted to the Planning Commission for approval
or disapproval or suggestions, and the Planning Commission shall have
30 days after the formal submission of the proposed amendment or
