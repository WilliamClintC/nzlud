PREFACE 
    The Kenai Peninsula Borough Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1975, has been kept current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the Borough Clerk. From 1987 through June 1997, the Borough Clerk's Office was responsible for keeping the Code current. In the Fall of 1997, Municipal Code Corporation performed an audit of the Code. The audited Code was republished in its entirety in April 1998. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the number of the title, chapter and section. Thus, Section 18.12.050 is Section .050 located in Chapter .12 of Title 18. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in codification. 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This republication of the Code brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 97-73, enacted December 16, 1997.

KENAI PENINSULA BOROUGH 
HISTORICAL NOTE 
    The Kenai Peninsula Borough was incorporated on January 1, 1964, as a borough of the second class by the Mandatory Borough Act (Chapter 52, SLA 1963) and the election held pursuant thereto on December 3, 1963, for determination of whether the borough should be first-class or second-class. 
    As so incorporated, the borough consisted of the combined Seward Election District No. 9 and the Kenai-Cook Inlet Election District No. 10 except for the Wildwood Station which was specifically excluded under Section 3(d) of said Act by the following provision: 
"(d)" So long as the following areas remain military reservations, they shall be excluded from any borough incorporated in accordance with this section; provided, however, that when an area shall no longer be subject to a military reservation, it shall become a part of the borough surrounding it. Areas excluded at this time are: 
"___________ 
"(7) Wildwood Station (base proper) ..." 
    Pursuant to the provisions of said Mandatory Borough Act referred to above, Wildwood Station became a part of the Kenai Peninsula Borough on June 30, 1973, the effective date of the Public Land Order No. 5346 revoking Public Land Order No. 773 which had withdrawn said land for use fo the Department of the Army for military purposes. 
    Other modifications of the original boundaries of the Kenai Peninsula Borough have been accomplished by action of the Local Boundary Commission of the State of Alaska pursuant to law. 
    The city school districts existing in the borough at the time of its incorporation were integrated into the borough by Sections 24.05.050, 25.05.010, and 24.05.015 of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Code of Ordinances adopted December 7, 1965, within the 2-year period of incorporation mandated by the statute applicable at the time, and since this integration has been accomplished, as require, by a special act of the assembly, they will not be codified in the new code. 
    By ordinance 69-11 the borough assembly, with the concurrence of the district school board, enacted Section 24.050.012 of the Code of Ordinances of the Kenai Peninsula Borough to provide for a school board of seven members. Since AS 14.12.040 provides that the number of members shall not be changed once a district has a seven-member board, this ordinance a special act of the assembly and will not be codified in the new code.

1.  discourage borough employees from acting upon personal or financial interests in the performance of their public responsibilities; 
2.  improve standards of public service; and 
3.  promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this borough in employees; 
C.  Holding borough employment is a public trust and, as one safeguard of that trust, the people require the borough employees to adhere to a code of ethics; 
D.  A fair and open government requires that the borough employees conduct the public's business in a manner that preserves the integrity of the governmental process and avoids conflicts of interest; 
E.  In order for the rules governing conduct to be respected both during and after leaving public service, the code of ethics must be administered fairly without bias or favoritism; 
F.  No code of conduct, however comprehensive, can anticipate all situations in which violations may occur, nor can it prescribe behaviors that are appropriate to every situation; in addition, laws and regulations regarding ethical responsibilities cannot legislate morality, eradicate corruption, or eliminate bad judgment; and 
G.  Compliance with a code of ethics is an individual responsibility; thus all who serve the borough have a solemn responsibility to avoid improper conduct and prevent improper behavior by colleagues and subordinates.

A voter may mark his ballot with a cross mark, "X" mark, diagonal, horizontal or vertical mark, solid mark, star, circle, asterisk, check or plus sign using the marking device provided at the polling place or with any black-inked marker. The marks will be counted only if they are clearly spaced in the square opposite the name of the candidate the voter desires to designate. 
2.  A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more candidates does not itself invalidate the entire ballot. 
3.  If a voter marks fewer names than there are persons to be elected to the office, a vote shall be counted for each candidate properly marked. 
4.  If a voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected to the office, the votes for candidates for that office shall not be counted. 
5.  The mark specified in subsection 1 of this section shall be counted only if it is substantially inside the square provided, or touching the square so as to indicate clearly that the voter intended the particular square marked. 
6.  Improper marks on the ballot shall not be counted and shall not invalidate marks for candidates properly marked. 
7.  An erasure or correction invalidates only that section of the ballot in which it appears. 
B.  The rules set out in this section are mandatory and there shall be no exceptions to them. A ballot may not be counted unless marked in compliance with these rules. 
(Ord. No. 2002-17, § 7, 6-4-02; Ord. No. 94-08, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 84-28, § 1(part), 1984) 
4.70.050. - Write-in votes.

B.  In order to vote for a write-in candidate, the voter must write a candidate's name in the space provided and, in addition, mark the square opposite the candidate's name in accordance with KPB 4.70.040A. Stickers may not be used. Use of stickers can cause that portion of the ballot to be invalidated. 
C.  Write-in votes shall only be tabulated by person if the total number of write-in votes for an office exceeds the smallest number of votes cast for a candidate for that office whose name is printed on the ballot. 
(Ord. No. 2002-17, § 8, 6-4-02; Ord. No. 94-08, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 84-28, § 1(part), 1984)

The election board shall, immediately upon completion of the certificate or as soon thereafter as the local mail service permits, send in one sealed package to the election supervisor one copy of the certificate and the register. In addition, all ballots properly cast shall be mailed or hand delivered to the election supervisor. The package shall clearly indicate the precinct from which it came. In those areas of the borough where ballots are counted by hand and computer counting centers away from the central counting center, the chairman shall forward their election results by telephone, telegram, radio or electronic transmission on the night of the election.

1.  Remove the ballot portion of the transmission from the portion that identifies the voter; 
2.  Place the ballot portion in a secrecy sleeve; 
3.  Seal the secrecy sleeve in an outer envelope of the type used for absentee ballots returned by mail, and seal that envelope;

G.  An electronically transmitted ballot shall be counted in the same manner as other absentee ballots, even though this procedure may reveal to one or more election officials the manner in which a particular absentee voter cast his or her ballot. However, it shall be unlawful to display a telefax ballot in a manner revealing the way in which a particular voter cast his or her ballot to any person other than the borough clerk, a member of the clerk's staff, an election official in the course of his or her duties, or an attorney advising the clerk on legal questions concerning the ballot.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2002-17, § 13, adopted Jun 4, 2002, repealed § 4.80.090, which pertained to absentee voting by personal representative. See the Code Comparative Table. 
4.80.095. - Special needs voting.

Absentee ballot envelopes shall be examined by the canvas board who shall determine whether the absentee voter is qualified to vote at the election and whether the ballot has been properly cast.

A.  No later than the Monday following each election, the election canvass board shall meet in public session and canvass all election returns. In full view of those present, the election canvass board shall judge the applicability of absentee and questioned ballots, shall open and tally those accepted, and shall compile the total votes cast in the election. The canvass of the ballot vote counted by the precinct election boards shall be accomplished by reviewing the tallies of the recorded vote to check for mathematical error by comparing totals with the precinct's certificate of results. All obvious errors found by the election canvass in the transfer of totals from the precinct tally sheets to the precinct certificate of results shall be corrected by the canvass board. A mistake which has been made in precinct returns that is not clearly an error in the transfer of the results from the tallies to the certificate of results empowers the canvassing board to recommend a recount of the results of the precinct or precincts for that portion of the returns in question. 
B.  Upon completion of the canvass, the canvassing board shall prepare a final certificate of the results of votes cast by absentee, questioned and challenged ballots and of votes cast by regular ballot, and shall prepare a written report of the results to be submitted to the assembly. 
C.  If election materials have not been received from a precinct prior to completion of the canvass, but election results have been transmitted by telephone, telegram, radio or electronic transmission, the canvassing board shall count the election results received. If the borough clerk has reason to believe that a missing precinct certificate, if received, would affect the result of the election, the clerk shall await the receipt of the certificate until 2:00 p.m. on the Tuesday following the election. If the certificate is not received by the clerk by 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, then the certificate shall not be counted nor included in the final certification of the canvassing board.

4.90.030. - Procedures for handling questioned ballots. 
    The canvassing board by majority vote may refuse to accept the question and count the ballot of a person properly questioned. If the ballot is refused, the clerk shall return a copy of the statement questioning the ballot to the voter, and shall enclose all rejected ballots in a separate envelope with statements of the basis for the question. The envelope shall be labeled with "rejected ballots" and shall be preserved with other voted ballots. If the ballot is not refused, the large envelope shall be opened, the smaller inner envelope shall be placed in a container and mixed with other absentee ballot envelopes or, in the case of counting questioned ballots, with other questioned ballot envelopes. The mixed smaller envelopes shall be drawn from the container and opened, and the ballots shall be counted according to the rules for determining properly marked ballots.

4.90.050. - Certification of the election results. 
A.  As soon as possible after completion of the canvass, but no later than the Tuesday following the election, the assembly shall meet in public session to receive the report of the canvass board. For a run-off election which is held the same year as a state election and a scheduling conflict exists, the assembly shall meet in public session to receive the report of the canvass board, no later than the second Wednesday following the election. If, after considering the report, the assembly determines that the election was validly held, the election shall be certified by resolution and entered upon the minutes of the meeting, together with the total number of votes cast for each candidate and for or against each proposition or question. 
B.  If the canvass board reports that a failure to comply with provisions of state law and borough ordinances, or an illegal election practice has occurred, and that such failure is sufficient to change the outcome of the election, then the assembly may exclude the votes cast in one or more precincts where such failure or illegal practices occurred from the total returns, or may declare the entire election invalid and order a new election. 
C.  If the canvass board reports an apparent discrepancy in the returns of one or more precincts, the assembly may order a recount of votes cast in said precinct or precincts. Such recount shall be conducted immediately by the canvass board and the results shall be reported to the assembly. The assembly shall meet as soon as possible to certify the results of the election recount. 
D.  Upon certification of a valid election, the clerk shall deliver to each person elected to office a certificate of election, signed by the clerk and authenticated by the seal of the borough.

B.  In conducting the recount, the recount board shall review all ballots to determine which ballots, or parts of ballots, were properly marked and which ballots are to be counted in the recount, and shall check the accuracy of the original count, the precinct certificate, and the review.

Further, in order to insure clear, fixed and reliable standards, it is necessary that citizens and those officials charged with the validation of petitions be able to rely on designated official, published maps, plats and records of the borough and on the published voter registration records of the state. 
(Ord. No. 94-08, § 1(part), 1994) 
4.130.020. - Application for petition.

(Ord. No. 94-08, § 1(part), 1994)

Further, in order to insure clear, fixed and reliable standards, it is necessary that citizens and those officials charged with the validation of petitions be able to rely on designated officials, and on the published voter registration records of the state.

The appeal must state the name of the owner, a legal description of the property, and the grounds for the appeal. If the party making the request is an assign of the record owner, documentation of the assignment must bear a stamp reflecting the recording district and the book and page number or serial number of the recorded assignment. If the party making the request is an agent of the property owner, the property owner's signature granting the authority must be notarized and attached to the request. It must be submitted to the borough clerk within 30 days after the mailing of the notice of assessment, or the right to appeal ceases unless the board of equalization finds that the taxpayer was unable to comply. No appeal application may be accepted unless a filing fee in the amount listed in the most current Kenai Peninsula Borough Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees is received by the clerk at the time of filing. If the appeal is withdrawn before evidence is due, or if the appellant or agent of the appellant is present for the appellant's hearing before the BOE or participates telephonically pursuant to KPB 5.12.060(T) then the filing fee shall be fully refunded within 30 days after the hearing date. For purposes of this section, the appeal is submitted on the date it is received in the office of the clerk or, if delivered by first class mail, the date it is postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service. Appeal forms shall be available from the borough assessor's office, borough clerk's office, or city offices within the borough. The borough clerk will provide to the assessor each appeal within two days of receipt. An application to proceed with an appeal as an indigent may be filed with the borough clerk's office in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in KPB 21.20.250(B). 
C.  Taxpayer request for a finding that the taxpayer was unable to comply with the timely filing requirement of KPB 5.12.050(B). 
1.  A property owner or agent or assign of the property owner may request a finding that the taxpayer was unable to comply with the requirement to timely file an appeal as required in paragraph B. of this section by filing a written request with the borough clerk within 14 days after the inability to comply ceased or within 14 days after the taxpayer should have become aware of the reason for filing the appeal, whichever is earlier. 
2.  The request for a finding of inability to comply must be based upon a serious condition or event beyond the taxpayer's control that resulted in the inability to timely file the appeal. For purposes of this subsection, a serious condition or event may include a serious medical condition or other similar serious condition or event that prevented the taxpayer from timely filing the appeal. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a failure to pick up or read mail or to make arrangements for an appropriate and responsible person to pick up or read mail or a failure to timely provide a current address to the Department of Assessing will not be deemed to result in an inability to comply. 
3.  A request for a finding of inability to comply is limited to an appeal of the notice of assessment for the current assessment year. 
4.  The written request must be submitted on a request form supplied by the borough clerk and must include the following: 
a.  Name of the property owner or agent or assign of the property owner; 
b.  The parcel number of the property; 
c.  If the party making the request is an assign of the record owner, documentation of the assignment must bear a stamp reflecting the recording district and the book and page number or serial number where the assignment is recorded; 
d.  If the party making the request is an agent of the property owner, the property owner's signature granting the authority must be notarized and attached to the request; 
e.  A description of the justification for the request must be subscribed and sworn or affirmed before a notary public or other official with similar authority by the property owner or duly authorized agent or assign; 
f.  Information sufficient to determine whether the request has been submitted within the time stated in KPB 5.12.050(C)(1); 
g.  An attached and properly completed and executed appeal form alleging one or more of the grounds for appeal stated in KPB 5.12.050(E). 
5.  A request bearing insufficient justification or information for evaluation constitutes a basis for final denial of the request. 
D.  Determination by the chair whether a request meets the requirements for consideration, procedure for evaluation of the merits of the asserted justification, and for scheduling a required hearing. 
1.  The chair is delegated the authority to review the request for compliance with KPB 5.12.050(C)(4). If the chair determines that the request does not meet the requirements of KPB 5.12.050(C)(4)(a-g), the chair will so indicate on the request. 
2.  If the chair finds that the request meets the requirements for consideration of the inability to comply, the chair will so indicate on the request. The chair will then consider the merits regarding the nature of circumstances of the inability to comply with the timely filing requirement. The chair may require additional evidence or testimony from the property owner or agent or assign. The clerk shall notify the party and shall schedule a time to meet with the chair, if necessary. Any additional information provided by the property owner shall be preserved for potential review. 
3.  If the chair determines that the taxpayer has not proven an inability to comply, the taxpayer may appeal the chair's decision within 15 days of the notice of decision to a panel of three other BOE members chosen by lot. The BOE panel shall conduct a review of the merits of the taxpayer's inability to comply. No deference shall be given to the decision by the chair. No new evidence may be presented to the panel. The decision by the three-member BOE panel shall be the final decision of the BOE. The clerk shall notify the parties in writing of the BOE's decision. 
4.  The taxpayer and borough shall have the right to appeal a final decision under KPB 5.12.050(C) and KPB 5.12.050(D) to court under the rules of appellate procedure governing appeals from administrative agency decisions. 
5.  If the chair or three-member BOE panel determines that the appellant's inability to comply with the filing requirements of KPB 5.12.050(B) was due to a serious condition or event beyond their control as defined in KPB 5.12.050(C)(2), the clerk shall schedule a hearing for the appeal and give the notices required by KPB 5.12.050(F). The matter shall proceed as provided in this Chapter. 
E.  The grounds for appeal are: unequal, excessive, improper or under valuation of the property not adjusted by the assessor to the property owner's satisfaction, or an error in ownership or classification of property. The potential validity or invalidity of asserted errors in assessment shall have no bearing on the determination of whether the taxpayer was unable to timely file an appeal. 
F.  After the time for filing valuation appeals has expired and after consultation with the assessor, and at the direction of the chair of the board of equalization, the borough clerk shall schedule meetings of the board of equalization. The clerk on behalf of the assessor shall schedule meetings of the board of equalization. The clerk on behalf of the assessor shall notify each appellant by electronic transmission, if the appellant consents to electronic notice, or first class mail of the time and place of hearing and board of equalization procedures at least 15 days before the evidence or documents required by KPB 5.12.055(A) and (B) must be provided to the borough clerk. A party can request a continuance of hearing only for good cause and the continuance must be requested no later than 15 days prior to the hearing date unless the reason for the continuance is a serious condition or event that prevented a timely request or that arose after the deadline. For the purposes of this subsection, a serious condition or event may include a serious medical condition, a serious family emergency requiring the presence of the party, a death in the family, or other similar serious condition or event. Additionally, a continuance shall not be granted if it will cause substantial prejudice to the other party. The chair of the board of equalization is given the discretion to determine whether to grant a request for a continuance. A continuance, however, does not extend the deadline for any party to file any documents or evidence under KPB 5.12.055(A) or (B), if the application was not filed with the borough clerk before the original deadline for filing such documents or evidence. If the application for a continuance was filed before the original deadline for filing documents and the application is denied, the application for a continuance will not extend the original deadline for filing documents. A hearing shall be scheduled for all notices of appeal unless the notice is clearly not based on one or more of the grounds stated in KPB 5.12.050(E) as determined by the BOE chair. When a hearing is not scheduled, the borough clerk shall notify the person who submitted the notice that a hearing will not be scheduled. 
G.  A city in the borough may appeal an assessment to the borough board of equalization in the same manner as the property owner. Within five days after receipt of the appeal, the assessor shall notify the property owner of the appeal by the city. The property owner may appear and participate in an appeal of an assessment by a city.

5.12.055. - Record-Discovery-Motions-Written presentation-On appeal. 
A.  Discovery: No more than 20 days after a written appeal is filed, the assessor and the appellant may submit interrogatories and requests for production to the other party. All such interrogatories and requests must seek information relevant to the valuation or, in the case of a flat tax appeal, an alleged error in ownership or classification of property. A party may not submit more than ten interrogatories and ten requests for production, including all discrete subparts of each interrogatory and request for production, to the opposing party. Responses shall be due no later than ten days after the request has been served by fax, in person, or mail upon the opposing party. For good cause shown the board chair may grant additional time to respond and authorize additional interrogatories and requests for production. In determining good cause for this purpose, the chair shall consider the burden and expense on the party to timely produce the requested information, whether the party seeking the extension has exercised due diligence in attempting to respond timely, whether the party seeking additional information has exercised due diligence in attempting to gain the necessary information from other sources, the complexity of the case, prejudice to the other party for allowing additional time and/or requests for information, and other factors deemed relevant by the chair. Any request for an extension or for additional discovery that is granted to one party shall also be equally granted to the other party. In any event, all responses must be delivered to the requesting party no later than 20 days before the board hearing on the appealed assessment. 
B.  Upon receipt of a written appeal, the assessor shall provide documents or evidence relating to each assessment that is appealed, including a summary of assessment data, to the borough clerk, for the board of equalization, no later than 15 days before the board hearing on the appealed assessment.

C.  The appellant shall provide a copy of any documents or evidence relating equalization, no later than 15 days before the board hearing on the appealed assessment. Pages shall be marked as appellant's exhibits and numbered. The clerk shall provide a copy of the appellant's documents to the assessor within two business days of receipt. 
D.  The appellant's case may be made by written presentation, if the appellant so elects, the pages shall be marked as appellant's brief and numbered. The written presentation, along with any documents and evidence referred to in 5.12.055(B), must be provided to the borough clerk, for the board of equalization, no later than 15 days before the board hearing on the appealed assessment. The clerk shall provide a copy of appellant's filings to the assessor upon receipt.

The chair of the board, or in his or her absence, the vice-chair, is authorized to decide each submitted motion. The decision may be reviewed by the board at the discretion of the chair or vice-chair, as appropriate. For good cause shown, including without limitation the bad faith conduct of the other party or new evidence which could not reasonably be obtained before the seven-day deadline with the exercise of due diligence, a party may submit a motion to the board no less than two business days before the scheduled hearing. In this instance, the chair, or in the chair's absence the vice-chair, shall provide the opposing party with a reasonable opportunity to oppose the motion prior to issuing a decision.

5.12.060. - Board of equalization procedure. 
A.  All appeals must be heard and decided before June 1, unless the board finds a hearing after this date will not prejudice the appellant and the delay is administratively justified or the appellant has requested a later hearing date. The board must also find that the proposed hearing date will enable the assessor to substantially comply with the requirement that the assessment roll be certified by June 1. The meetings of the board may be scheduled either on weekends, during business hours, or during evening hours. In no event may an appeal hearing begin after midnight. 
B.  A quorum of the board must be present in order for the board of equalization to convene and take action. Actions of the board shall be by the majority of members present. A quorum consists of three members. The presiding officer shall select the alternate member to fill a vacancy or substitute in the absence of a regular board member. If membership of the board changes while an appeal is pending the new member may participate only by making an oral or written statement on the record that the member has reviewed the record and proceedings thus far and feels qualified to render an informed and impartial decision. 
C.  The chairperson shall preside over the board hearing. In the absence of the chairperson, the vice-chairperson shall preside. If both are absent, the members present shall select a person to preside. The borough clerk shall attend the hearings to record the proceedings, record votes, and administer the oaths to witnesses. The borough attorney or designee shall attend the hearing to advise the board. 
D.  The presiding officer shall open the board session by calling the board to order and by calling each appellant's name and asking if the appellant or representative is present. The presiding officer shall bring each appeal before the board in the order scheduled by the borough clerk. 
Agenda. Each appeal shall be conducted in the following order: 
1.  Summary of Assessment Data (read into the record by the presiding officer); 
2.  Appellant's Opening Presentation; 
3.  Assessor's Opening Presentation; 
4.  Rebuttal by the Appellant; 
5.  Rebuttal and closing by the Assessor; 
6.  Sur-Rebuttal and closing by the Appellant. 
E.  If the appellant or representative is not present when called, the board shall consider any written presentation, evidence, and documents presented to it pursuant to KPB 5.12.055 and thereafter proceed according to the remaining applicable provisions of this chapter. 
F.  All persons presenting evidence shall do so under oath, administered by the borough clerk. 
G.  1.  Hearing: The hearing shall be conducted informally with respect to the introduction of evidence. Irrelevant evidence may be excluded by the presiding officer. Each side shall have a total of no more than 15 minutes to present their case. Each side shall be responsible for dividing their 15 minutes between oral presentation, argument, testimony (including witness testimony), and rebuttal. The board may expand or limit the length of the hearing depending on its complexity, or take other action to expedite the proceedings. Cross-examination will not be permitted during presentation of the case. If a witness testifies during presentation of either the appellant's or the assessor's case, unless excused by the board with the concurrence of the appellant and the assessor, the witness must remain available in the assembly room to be called to testify during rebuttal by the appellant and the assessor. 
2.  Exhibits: The only exhibits that shall be admitted into the record at the hearing are those exhibits provided to the clerk in accordance with KPB 5.12.055 B through KPB 5.12.055 D. However, at the hearing, parties may use demonstrative or illustrative exhibits, provided that all such exhibits may only be duplicates of exhibits or information provided to the board in accordance with KPB 5.12.055 B through KPB 5.12.055 D. Additionally, witnesses may write on a board while orally testifying to illustrate their testimony. The limitation on the use of exhibits in this section shall not preclude the parties from presenting oral testimony at the hearing. 
3.  Failure to respond to requests: Failure to timely provide information requested pursuant to these rules without good cause shown shall, upon notice from the requesting party to the clerk and the other party, prevent the party failing to provide the information from including such information in the written evidence or using such evidence at the hearing. Before a ruling is issued on this matter, the party failing to provide the requested information shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity by the board chair to present its case as to why this sanction should not be imposed, and the opposing party shall have a reasonable opportunity to respond. 
H.  The presiding officer shall first present a brief, factual summary of assessment data concerning the appealed property. This summary is not charged against the time allowed the assessor to present his or her case. 
I.  The appellant or representative then presents the appellant's case when called by the presiding officer. At this time the appellant may call the assessor or appropriate appraiser or any other witnesses the appellant intends to present as a witness at this time. The scope of direct questioning is limited to the issues in dispute. Should the appellant wish, and prior to beginning the presentation, a portion of the 15 minutes allowed may be reserved for rebuttal, sur-rebuttal, and closing arguments. At the conclusion of the appellant's presentation, board members may question the appellant or their witnesses. 
J.  The assessor or designee then presents the borough's case when called by the presiding officer. At this time the assessor may call the appellant or any other witnesses the assessor intends to present as a witness. The scope of direct questioning is limited to the issues in dispute. Should the assessor wish, and prior to beginning the presentation, a portion of the 15 minutes allowed may be reserved for rebuttal, and/or closing argument. At the conclusion of the assessor's presentation, board members may ask questions of the assessor or their witnesses. 
K.  The time required to answer questions from the board shall not be charged against either party. 
L.  If the appellant or the assessor has reserved a portion of their 15 minutes, each may then present rebuttal evidence, with the appellant proceeding first. The appellant and assessor may call and cross-examine each other's witnesses during rebuttal. The scope of cross-examination is limited to the issues raised in direct questioning. 
M.  The assessor may recommend changes to the existing value during the hearing. 
N.  After the appellant and assessor have presented their cases, the hearing shall be closed by the presiding officer, and no further evidence shall be offered or considered in deliberations unless a member of the board of equalization asks for additional information from either party. Both parties shall be given an equal opportunity to respond to any such requests for additional information. 
O.  The board may decide the appeal after the presentations, or it may defer a decision until no later than the last hearing date. The board may move to go into an adjudicative session for purposes of making a decision. Final board action shall be taken by motions, after reconvening in public, that set out specific findings of fact, and shall not be reconsidered, amended or rescinded by the board. The motions available to the board are: motion to uphold the assessor's valuation, motion to reduce the assessment, motion to increase the assessment, motion to dismiss the appeal, motion to defer the decision, or any other motion set out in Alaska statutes and regulations governing board of equalization appeals. Only one motion may be on the floor at a time, and the board shall vote on the motions until its findings are established. The vote must be taken and entered into the permanent record of the proceedings. 
P.  The burden of proof is on the appellant. The only grounds for the board to adjust the assessment are proof of unequal, excessive, improper, or under valuation, based on facts proven at the appeal hearing. The board may not alter the assessment of a property unless a timely written appeal has been filed concerning the property. If an appellant has refused or failed to provide the assessor or the assessor's agent full access to property or records related to assessment of the property, upon notice from the assessor to the appellant and the clerk, the appellant shall be precluded from offering evidence on the issue or issues affected by that lack of access. Before a ruling is issued on the admissibility of such evidence, the appellant shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity by the presiding officer to present its case as to why this sanction should not be imposed, and the assessor shall have a reasonable opportunity to respond. 
Q.  After the last scheduled appeal is heard, the presiding officer shall adjourn the session. 
R.  The attorney for the board shall prepare the board's decisions. The borough clerk shall certify the decisions of the board, and shall keep the decisions on file as part of the public record. The clerk shall promptly mail a copy of the board's decision to each appellant, by certified mail, and deliver a copy to the borough assessor. 
S.  Either the appellant or the assessor may appeal the decision of the board to the superior court in the Kenai venue district, within 30 days of the date of mailing of the board's decision, as provided by the rules of appellate procedure governing appeals from administrative agency decisions. The record on appeal is the record established at the board hearing. 
T.  All parties or their agents and witnesses must appear in person at the BOE hearing unless good cause, such as a serious medical condition that prevents travel, or where the reasonable travel expenses clearly outweigh the potential benefit of the appeal is shown. Telephonic participation may be denied if it would cause substantial prejudice to the other party. Any request for telephonic participation must be received by the borough clerk at 144 North Binkley Street, Soldotna, Alaska, no later than 15 days before the hearing, unless good cause is shown for filing a late request. Good cause for filing a later request may include a serious medical condition, a serious family emergency requiring the presence of the party, a death in the family, or other similar serious condition or event that either prevented the party from filing a timely request for telephonic participation or that arose after the deadline for filing the request. If telephonic participation is approved, then the party requesting telephonic participation shall be responsible for arranging the telephone call and for payment of associated telephone charges. The chair of the board of equalization is given the discretion to determine whether to grant a request for telephonic participation.

For property that first qualifies for a low-income housing credit under 26 U.S.C. § 42 on or after January 1, 2001, the assembly may determine, by parcel, whether the property shall be assessed based on the estimated price that it would bring in an open market and under the then-prevailing market conditions in a sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer both conversant with the property and with prevailing general price levels, or on the basis of actual income derived from the property without adjustment based on the amount of any federal income tax credit given for the property. Once the manner of assessment of the property has been determined under this subparagraph, the assembly may not change the manner of assessment of that parcel of property if debt relating to the property incurred in conjunction with the properties qualifying for the low-income housing tax credit remains outstanding. 
C.  To secure an assessment based upon the actual income derived from the property under this section, an owner of property that qualifies for the low-income housing credit shall apply to the assessor before May 15 of each year in which the assessment is desired.

A.  A single parcel of real property owned and occupied as the primary residence and permanent place of abode is exempt from taxation as set forth in subsections 1 and 2 of this section. The limitation to a single parcel shall apply unless the applicant has applied for and received a determination that any additional parcel proposed for exemption qualifies as a subsidiary parcel eligible for inclusion as part of the primary residence and permanent place of abode under state law. In no event shall an exemption be allowed for a total value in excess of $300,000.00 for all parcels included under the exemption, unless a hardship is granted as described in KPB 5.12.105(I).

C.  Only one exemption may be granted for the same property and, if two or more persons are eligible for an exemption for the same property, the parties shall decide among themselves who is to receive the benefit of the exemption.

E.  No exemption under this section may be granted except upon written application on a form prescribed by the assessor. The application must be postmarked by or hand-delivered to the assessing department no later than March 31 of the tax year for which the exemption is sought. If March 31 does not fall on a borough business day, then the application is timely filed if postmarked or hand-delivered during the next borough business day after March 31. A qualified senior citizen, disabled veteran, or surviving widow or widower of either, need not file such an application for successive tax years if there is no change in ownership, no change in permanent place of abode by the owner of record, or no change in status of disability if the owner is a disabled veteran.

Exemption applications filed after March 31 of the tax year must be accompanied by a signed affidavit stating good cause for failure to comply with the March 31 filing deadline. If a qualified claimant files an untimely application, the assembly may, for good cause shown, waive the claimant's failure to make timely application and authorize the Assessor to accept the application as if timely filed. An application, whether timely filed or filed after a grant of extension of time to file, may be held open for consideration through the following three years if eligibility for the exemption is contingent upon a determination by another entity. If a failure to timely file has been waived and the application for exemption is approved, the amount of tax that the claimant has already paid, if any, for the year the property would have been eligible for exemption shall be refunded to the claimant. 
1.  If property is occupied by a person other than the eligible applicant and his or her spouse and minor children, this exemption applies only to the portion of the property occupied by the eligible applicant and his or her spouse and minor children as a permanent place of abode.

It shall be the responsibility of every person who obtains an exemption under this section to notify the borough assessor of any change in ownership, residency, permanent place of abode or status of disability.

Property owners shall notify the borough when the requirements for exemption are no longer met. 
3.  It shall be the responsibility of every person who obtains a property tax exemption under this chapter to notify the borough assessor of any change in ownership, property use, residency, permanent place of abode, status of disability, or other factor affecting qualification for the exemption. If the assessor determines that the property is not eligible for this exemption, all taxes, penalty, and interest due on the property for all tax years beginning with the year the property should have been subject to taxation shall be immediately due and owing. 
4.  Good cause shown. If an otherwise qualified claimant is unable to comply with the March 31 deadline for filing an application, the assembly may, by resolution, waive the claimant's failure to file the application by such date for good cause shown, and authorize the Assessor to accept the application as if timely filed. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" means an inability to comply with the March 31 deadline that was caused by a serious condition or extraordinary event beyond the taxpayer's control. A serious condition or extraordinary event may include a serious medical condition or other similar serious condition or extraordinary event. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a failure to pick up or read mail or to make arrangements for an appropriate and responsible person to pick up or read mail or a failure to timely provide a current address to the Department of Assessing will not be deemed to result in an inability to comply. This section does not create any private rights whatsoever, nor does it in any manner require the mayor or any assembly member to introduce or approve any such resolution. 
F.  The assessor may presume that property has not been occupied as a primary residence and permanent place of abode if the applicant occupied it for less than 185 days during the previous year unless the applicant provides satisfactory evidence that he or she meets the statutory criteria for an allowable absence under AS 43.23.008 as now enacted or may be hereinafter amended.

3.  Equipment failure if the failure is not a predictably frequent or recurring event or preventable by adequate equipment maintenance or operation. 
C.  Eligibility. To be eligible for reassessment, the damage to the property shall have been caused by any of the following: 
1.  A disaster in an area or region declared by the mayor, the governor, or the president to be in a condition of disaster emergency. 
2.  A disaster as that term is defined in this section. 
3.  A disaster that, with respect to a possesory interest in land owned by the state or federal government has caused the permit or other right to enter upon the land to be suspended or restricted. 
D.  Application for reassessment. 
1.  The application for reassessment must be filed with the assessor within 60 days of the disaster by delivering to the assessor a written application, on a form provided by the assessor, requesting reassessment and describing the condition and value of the property immediately before and after the damage or destruction. 
2.  If no application is made and the assessor determines that within the calendar year a property has suffered damage caused by disaster that may qualify the property owner for relief under an ordinance adopted under this section, the assessor may provide the last known owner of the property with an application for reassessment. The property owner shall file the completed application within 30 days of the date of the mailing of notification by the assessor but in no case more than 60 days after the occurrence of said damage. 
3.  Upon receiving the proper application, the assessor or assessor's designee will inspect the property and verify the prior year's full and true value of land, improvements, personal property, or the proposed or certified current year's value immediately before and after the damage or destruction. 
4.  If an applicant has refused or failed to provide the assessor or the assessor's agent full access to property or records reasonably requested by the assessor, the applicant shall be precluded from any reduction or relief, and any valuation or valuation issue affected by the lack of access shall be decided in favor of the assessor. 
5.  If the sum of the full and true values of the land, improvements, and personal property before the damage exceeds the sum of the values after the damage by $10,000.00 or more, the assessor shall also separately determine the percentage reduction in value of the land, improvements, or personal property due to the damage or destruction. The assessor shall reduce the values appearing on the assessment roll by the percentage of damage or destruction computed pursuant to this section, and the taxes due on the property shall be adjusted as provided this section. However, the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the actual loss. 
6.  Any damages to land, improvements, personal property, or additions that do not appear on the assessment roll are not eligible for consideration under this section. 
E.  Notice of reassessment. The assessor shall notify the applicant in writing of the amount of the proposed reassessment. The notice shall state that the applicant may appeal the proposed reassessment to the board of equalization within 30 days of the date of mailing the notice. 
F.  Appeal. Appeals of the reassessed value shall be heard in accordance with the valuation and flat tax appeal procedures provided in this chapter. A decision of the board of equalization regarding reassessment issued pursuant to this section shall create no presumption regarding the value of the affected property subsequent to the date of the damage. 
G.  Tax roll adjustment. Any reassessed value resulting from one or more reductions in full and true value of amounts, as determined above, shall be forwarded to the finance director. The finance director shall calculate and enter the reassessed tax values on the finance roll as a tax adjustment request (TAR). 
H.  Tax adjustment. The tax rate fixed for the property so reassessed shall be applied to the amount of the reassessment as determined in accordance with this section. The owner of record shall be liable for a prorated portion of the taxes that would have been due on the property for the current calendar year had the disaster not occurred. This proration is determined on the basis of the number of days remaining in the calendar year beginning with the date of the disaster. For purposes of applying the calculation in prorating taxes, the term "calendar year" means the portion of the current tax year used to determine the adjusted amount of taxes based on a 365-day year. If the damage or destruction occurred after January 1 and before the beginning of the next calendar year, the reassessment shall be utilized to determine the tax liability for the current year. Any tax paid in excess of the total tax due shall be refunded to the taxpayer as an erroneously collected tax within 60 days of the final determination of the adjusted tax liability. 
I.  Effect of revised assessment. The assessed value of the property in its damaged condition, as determined pursuant to this section shall be the taxable value of the property until December 31 of the year in which the disaster occurred, unless the value is otherwise adjusted as allowed by law.

C.  Watercraft for which all certificates of number, registration, or documentation, or other form of maritime licensing or registration and the ADF&G number, if applicable, have been surrendered to the issuing authority by January 1 of the tax year shall be taxed on an ad valorem basis.

    "Destroyed" means aircraft that have been damaged by age, weather, neglect and/or external influences outside the owner's control, and only unusable parts remain that, due to their condition can no longer be assembled to create any contrivable aircraft. This shall be evidenced by photographs and a physical inspection by the KPB Assessing staff appraiser if deemed necessary by the borough assessor. 
    "Dismantled" means aircraft that have been voluntarily disassembled and only parts remain that can no longer be assembled to create any contrivable aircraft.

The method is as follows: 
1.  The population of each tax authority group (TAG) shall be determined. Population shall be established by the latest figures determined by the Kenai Peninsula Borough and accepted by the State of Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs for allocation of state revenue sharing funds, or other reliable data. Where a TAG boundary and the boundary of the most similar area counted for population (usually a voting precinct) do not coincide, an estimate of the population of the dissimilar area shall be made to arrive at the most accurate determination of population of the TAG. The sum of the populations of all TAGs shall equal the total population of the borough. 
2.  The total receipts shall be apportioned to each TAG based upon its percentage of the total borough population. 
3.  The receipts apportioned to a particular TAG shall be distributed to the tax authority funds (TAFs) which make up that TAG. Such distribution shall be based upon the mill rates of the TAFs compared to the total mill rate of the TAG. The percentage shall be equal to the TAFs mill rate divided by the total mill rate for the TAG. 
D.  One motor vehicle per household owned by a resident 65 years of age or older on January 1st of the assessment year is exempt from the registration tax under AS 28.10.431. An exemption may be granted under this subsection only upon written application on a form prescribed by the department of public safety.

No. 98-61 is hereby repealed." 

5.14.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health of the anadromous streams identified in KPB 21.18.025 by providing tax credits as partial reimbursement for habitat protection and restoration project expenses on and adjacent to these streams. 
(Ord. No. 2011-37, § 1, 1-1-12; Ord. No. 2000-24, § 2, 8-1-00; Ord. No. 95-32, § 1(part), 1995) 
5.14.020. - Administration. 
A.  This chapter shall be administered by the director of planning and the director of assessing under the direction of the mayor. 
B.  Prior to beginning construction of a project for which one wishes to receive a tax credit, the property owner must submit an application for prequalification of the project to the planning department on a form provided by the director of planning. This application must be accompanied by all necessary federal, state, and local permits or approvals for the project. Within 30 business days of application, the director of planning shall mail notice to the applicant as to whether the proposed project has pre-qualified. If this notice is not mailed as provided herein, prequalification is deemed denied. 
C.  Upon completion, the applicant must schedule an inspection of the project with the planning department. If the applicant does not schedule an inspection the borough may enter the property to conduct the inspection. Inspections must be scheduled no later than January 15 of the year for which the tax credit is sought. Within 30 business days of this inspection, the planning department shall mail notice to the applicant whether the project as completed qualifies for the tax credit. The notice shall contain a determination of the costs being allowed. A copy shall be sent to the assessor. If this notice is not mailed as provided herein, the tax credit is deemed denied. 
D.  For the first tax year following completion of the project, the assessor shall provide a credit to the owner of the land upon which the project was constructed of up to 50% of the taxes levied upon that land, or the taxable interest in that land, for that year or the costs incurred on the project, whichever is less. In the second year, the assessor will provide a further tax credit of up to 50% of the taxes levied upon that land, or the taxable interest in that land, for that year of the remainder of the costs incurred on that project not previously credited, whichever is less. In the third year, the assessor will provide further tax credit of up to 50% of the taxes levied upon that land, or the taxable interest in that land, for that year or the remainder of the costs expended on that project not previously credited, whichever is less. The credit must be taken in 3 consecutive years and is limited to those 3 years regardless of the costs incurred by the applicant. Only the land value, which is defined as that value attributed to the land in the assessor's notice of assessment, is included in calculating the amount of the tax credit. 
E.  If prequalification of the tax credit is denied, or less costs for the project are allowed than the applicant thinks appropriate, the applicant may appeal that decision to the mayor on a form provided by the mayor. Appeals shall be made within ten days of the date of notice of any decision under this section. In reviewing a denial, the mayor shall grant prequalification if the proposal conforms to the requirements of the ordinance. The mayor shall grant the credit if the project, as completed, substantially conforms to the plans submitted for prequalification or if the mayor determines the project conforms to the requirements of the ordinance. Appeals from the mayor's determination shall be taken to superior court in Kenai Alaska pursuant to the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure Part 6. 
(Ord. No. 2012-37, § 2, 10-9-12; Ord. No. 2011-37, § 1, 1-1-12; Ord. No. 97-27, § 1, 1997; Ord. No. 96-29, § 1, 1996; Ord. No. 95-32, § 1(part), 1995) 
5.14.030. - Limitations on tax credit. 
A.  The tax credit for the protection/restoration project will only be granted for preapproved and verified out of pocket costs. In the calculation of the out of pocket expenses, federal, state and private non-repayable grants cannot be considered. Out of pocket costs not pre-approved may be granted if shown to be necessary and they are verified in writing. Invoices or other written verification must identify the owner of the property as the ultimate purchaser. 
B.  The tax credit is not transferable, including but not limited to, a purchaser of the land upon which the project was constructed. 
C.  Projects which are required by state, federal, or local authorities do not qualify for the tax credit. 
D.  All projects must be located within 150 horizontal feet from the mean high tide line or ordinary high water line of the rivers and streams listed in KPB 21.18. 
E.  The tax credit only applies to that portion of the taxes levied by the borough and any applicable service area and the credit would be apportioned pro rata between them based on their respective mill rates. However, if a city within the borough adopts a tax credit ordinance identical to this ordinance and the city further requests that the borough administer the city's tax credit ordinance, then the borough will do so. 
F.  The total tax credit available in any year is 50% of the taxes due on the land value for that year regardless of the number of projects on that property. 
G.  Any exemption applicable to property for which the tax credit is sought shall first be deducted from the improvement value of the property and then from the land value remaining before determining the amount of the tax credit. No tax credit may be granted during a year on property for which no taxes are due for that year. 
H.  Property that has been subdivided or transferred after construction of an eligible project will not be eligible for any portion of the tax credit in any year following the subdivision or transfer. 
I.  Neither an owner's labor, or that of volunteers, qualifies as an allowable cost for calculating a tax credit under this ordinance. 
J.  If an enforcement proceeding has been initiated on the property under KPB 21.25 the project will not be eligible for a tax credit until the enforcement notice has been resolved. 
(Ord. No. 2011-37, § 1, 1-1-12; Ord. No. 2000-24, § 3, 8-1-00; Ord. No. 95-32, § 1(part), 1995)

    Only the following projects may be considered for the tax credit: 
A.  Gratewalks, boardwalks, and bridges and spans meeting specifications established in KPB 21.18.071. 
B.  Spruce trees cabled parallel to the river bank as a buffer between the water and the bank established in KPB 21.18.071. 
C.  Stairways, steps, ladders and fish cleaning stations meeting specifications established in KPB 21.18.071. 
D.  Floating docks issued the necessary permit or permits to build so long as the completed dock conforms to the standards applicable to the issuance of permits by permitting agencies. 
E.  Projects which prevent or reduce the likelihood that petroleum products, including petroleum products in water runoff from roads, will enter the rivers. Where applicable, such projects must conform to any federal or state standards to be eligible for this tax credit. 
F.  Bank restoration, bank protection or habitat restoration projects that protect the river's habitat or restore habitat provided the project complies with all conditions, regulations and approvals imposed by local, state or federal agencies. Projects required as mitigation for onsite or offsite habitat degradation, bank hardening, or other bank stabilization strategies not designed to improve habitat are exempted from the tax credit. 
G.  Removal of structures from within the habitat protection district established in KPB 21.18.040. 
(Ord. No. 2011-37, § 1, 1-1-12; Ord. No. 2000-24, § 4, 8-1-00; Ord. No. 97-27, § 2, 1997; Ord. No. 96-29, § 2, 1996; Ord. No. 95-32, § 1(part), 1995) 
5.14.050. - Planning department review. 
    The director of planning shall prepare an annual report on the number of applications received under this chapter and the action taken on them. This report shall be submitted by April 1 of each year. The report shall also contain any recommendations the planning department may have for changes in the activities eligible for the credit consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Reports or recommendations for changes may be submitted more frequently at the discretion of the mayor. 
(Ord. No. 2012-37, § 3, 10-9-12; Ord. No. 2011-37, § 1, 1-1-12; Ord. No. 95-32, § 1(part), 1995)

5.18.400. - Computation-Addition of tax to total retail price-Tax schedule-Exceptions. 
A.  The tax to be added to the sale price, charge or rental shall be calculated using the current percent of the sale price, charge or rental rounded off to the nearest cent by eliminating any fraction of one-half cent or less and by increasing any fraction over one-half cent to the next highest cent. Each seller shall be furnished the schedule of tax payable on each taxable amount from one cent to $100.00. Any one sale of items separately priced shall be taxed upon the aggregate amount, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
B.  Each purchase from a vending machine shall be treated as an individual sale for application of KPB 5.18.430. 
(Ord. No. 2010-33, § 1, 9-21-10; Ord. No. 2002-39, § 10, 12-10-02; Ord. No. 94-27, § 10, 1994; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.410. - Computation-Seller-Restrictions on imposition of tax. 
A.  The seller shall, whenever feasible, separately state the tax to the buyer on each taxable transaction. When not feasible to state separately, the seller shall prominently display a sign indicating the imposition of the tax. 
B.  A seller shall not advertise, hold out or state to the public or to any buyer, directly or indirectly, that the tax payment or any part thereof imposed by this chapter will be assumed or absorbed by the seller, or that it will not be added to the sales price or that it will be refunded or assumed, in whole or in part. 
(Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.420. - Computation-Installment sales-Tax collected when. 
    When a sale is made on an installment basis, the sales tax shall be collected at the time of the sale, calculated at the sales tax rate in effect at the time of the sale.

C.  Services provided on account and billed to the customer on a periodic basis are subject to application to the tax on a maximum of $500.00 of each billing, per account. For purposes of this section, any advance payment for services other than to a trust or escrow account is considered to be paid pursuant to a "billing." 
D.  Each night's rental of each individual unit of temporary lodging shall be considered a separate transaction and therefore the maximum tax computation shall be calculated on a per unit per night basis. Rental by a single person or entity of an entire facility, such as a lodge or hotel for multi-person overnight use, does not affect this provision that each night's rental of each individual unit shall be considered a separate transaction. 
E.  Long-term vehicles leases shall be treated as one transaction per year, and per fractional year, of the lease term. The tax paid for any fraction of a year shall equal the tax paid for a whole year. The sales tax for the entire long-term vehicle lease shall be due and collected at the time of the first payment. Tax shall be calculated at the sales tax rate in effect on the day the lease is signed. There shall be no refund of such taxes should the lease terminate earlier than on its terms.

F.  Any increase to the maximum sales tax described in subsection (A), above, shall not take effect until ratified by a simple majority of voters at a regular borough election. 
G.  Recreational sales shall be treated on a per person per day basis and therefore the maximum tax computation shall be calculated on a per person per day basis. For purposes of this subsection, the term "person" means an individual human being.

D.  The borough may by written agreement, or shall by court order, vary the application of payments. 
(Ord. No. 94-27, § 12, 1994) 
5.18.450. - Tax jurisdiction-Office location of seller. 
A.  The rate of tax to be added to the sale price is based on the place of sale. The place of sale of goods and merchandise is the location of the retail outlet at which or from which delivery was made. This provision applies to goods delivered to buyers within the borough and to goods delivered to buyers outside the borough but within the state of Alaska. If the invoice includes a charge for installation, then the place of the sale for the goods and service is the retail outlet at which or from which delivery was made. When goods are delivered into the borough from a point outside of the borough and the seller maintains an ongoing physical presence in the borough, then the location of the seller's in-borough presence will determine the place of sale. If a seller has no ongoing physical presence in the borough but has established nexus with the borough, the point of delivery will determine the place of sale. If the seller has no ongoing physical presence in, or nexus with, the borough the sale is not subject to the borough sales tax. For purposes of this section the following terms are defined as shown below: 
1.  "Nexus" means the seller has established a taxable connection within the borough by use of marketing techniques, such as directed advertising in the borough via telephone or internet, or door-to-door sales within the borough, or by use of contract workers or contract or commission agents or businesses, which are associated with the seller's efforts to establish or maintain a market for its goods or services, deliver those goods or services, or provide warranty or other repair or return services in the borough. 
2.  The "point of delivery" where there is no ongoing physical presence in the borough is the place where physical possession of the goods is transferred to the customer. 
B.  Sellers located outside the borough but which fulfill orders for buyers inside the borough that were solicited or facilitated by commission or fee agents, independent contractors or other persons located in the borough associated or affiliated with the seller shall be responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax on those orders, unless the tax is collected and remitted by the agent or contractor. 
C.  The place of sale of services is where the services are delivered, which means the place where the services are rendered. The place of sale for freight, delivery, and courier services is the pickup location. The place of sale for services involving the transportation of passengers is the location where the passengers are picked up. The place of sale for vehicle towing services is the place where the vehicle is delivered. The place of sale for rentals is the place where the real property is located, or where the personal property is delivered to the renter. The borough shall determine the place of sale of a good, service, or rental pursuant to this section, and the borough's determination is final. 
D.  When there is a question or dispute over the place where services are rendered, a seller of a service may, after requesting and receiving borough approval in writing, collect the tax based on the office location of the business selling such services. Approval of a request to collect a tax at the seller's office location is completely within the discretion of the borough, and shall not be granted if the borough has already determined that the place of sale for the seller's industry is not the office location. 
E.  The seller is liable for any sales taxes due because of the seller's incorrect determination of the sales tax rate to be applied. 
(Ord. No. 2016-31 , § 10, 9-6-16; Ord. No. 2002-39, § 13, 12-10-02; Ord. No. 94-27, § 13, 1994) 
5.18.500. - Returns/records/audit-Returns-Filing required-Filing schedule. 
A.  Every seller is required to file a sales tax return, on forms furnished by the borough, according to the filing schedule established by the borough for that seller, whether or not any sale was made. The borough may exempt a seller from the requirements of this section if the borough determines the seller is completely exempt from collecting and remitting sales tax. 
B.  All sellers shall file sales tax returns on a quarterly basis. The borough may require more or less frequent filing under the following conditions: 
1.  For the first six months after a sales tax certificate is issued, the seller may be required to file monthly. 
2.  When the seller enters into a secured payment agreement with the borough, the seller may be required to file monthly, until all delinquencies are cured. 
3.  For accounts that have had less than $6,000.00 in taxable sales in the preceding 12 months, sellers may be allowed to file annually. 
4.  A seller with a delinquent account, which includes a balance due of over $25.00, or a missed filing, who fails to cure the delinquency within 15 days of the date of a notice of delinquency sent by regular mail, may be required to file monthly. 
5.  On a case-by-case basis, the borough may determine that an alternate filing schedule is appropriate. In such cases, the seller will be notified in writing of the filing schedule. 
C.  A seller may apply at any time to the borough, in writing, for a change in filing schedule. The borough may consider the seller's sales tax return filing history in making a determination on the application. 
(Ord. No. 2016-31 , § 11, 9-6-16; Ord. No. 2002-39, § 14, 12-10-02; Ord. No. 90-71, § 3, 1990; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 88-40, §§ 2, 3, 1988; Ord. No. 87-10, §§ 1, 5, 1987; Ord. No. 86-16, § 1(part), 1986; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.510. - Returns/records/audit-Returns-Contents. 
A.  Every seller required by this chapter to collect sales tax shall file with the borough upon forms furnished by it a return setting forth the following information with totals rounded to the nearest dollar: 
1.  Gross sales; 
2.  The nontaxable portions separately stating the amount of sales revenue attributable to each class of exemption; 
3.  Computation of taxes to be remitted; 
4.  Such other information as may be required by the borough. 
B.  The borough reserves the right to reject a filed return for failure to comply with the requirements of this section, for one year from the date of filing. The borough shall give written notice to a seller that a return has been rejected, including the reason for the rejection. In the event the borough rejects a tax return, any interest and penalties later assessed by the borough for nonpayment of full taxes shall start accruing with the original filing date of the tax return, not the date that the return was rejected. 
(Ord. No. 2016-31 , § 12, 9-6-16; Ord. No. 94-27, § 14, 1994; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 86-16, § 1, 1986; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985)

B.  A transmittal of taxes made by mail shall not be considered delinquent if the postmark on the envelope indicates the date of mailing to be on or before the first business day following the last day of the month following the end of the reporting period. 
(Ord. No. 94-27, § 15, 1994; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 86-16, § 1(part), 1986; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.530. - Returns/records/audit-Returns-Credit for costs of collection. 
A.  If a return is filed and payment in full is remitted by the filing deadline, a seller in full compliance with this chapter may retain 5% of the tax collected, to a maximum of $1,000 per quarter, to cover the costs of collecting the tax. 
B.  If the seller is not in full compliance with this chapter, the seller is not eligible for and may not retain the 5% credit. 
C.  A seller is not in full compliance if the seller: 
1.  Has an account with a balance due, or 
2.  Has a missing or incomplete return outstanding, or 
3.  Is not in compliance with a borough-approved payment plan. 
(Ord. No. 2016-31 , § 13, 9-6-16; Ord. No. 90-71, § 4, 1990; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.540. - Returns/records/audit-Returns-Confidentiality requirement-Exceptions. 
A.  Returns which include remittance in full of all sales taxes due and which are timely and properly filed with the borough for the purposes of complying with the terms of this chapter and all data obtained from such returns are confidential, and such returns and data obtained therefrom shall be kept from inspection by all private persons. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the audit and investigation by the borough of any return filed under this chapter or of the books and records of any seller required to file any return under this chapter. 
B.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or his duly authorized representative, of a copy of any return or report filed by him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular buyers or sellers, nor to prohibit the furnishing of information on a reciprocal basis to other agencies or political subdivisions of the state or the United States concerned with the enforcement of tax laws. 
C.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the disclosure through enforcement action proceedings or by public inspection or publication of the name, estimated balance due, and current status of payments, and filings of any seller or agent of any seller required to collect sales taxes or file returns under this chapter, who fails to file any return and/or remit in full all sales taxes due within 30 days after the required date for that business. Entry into any agreement whether pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or otherwise shall not act as any prohibition to disclosure of the records of that seller as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
D.  A prospective lessee or purchaser of any business or business interest may inquire as the obligation or tax status of any business upon presenting to the mayor a release of tax information request signed by the registered owner of the business.

(Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985) 
5.18.555. - Returns/records/audit-Returns-Finality of returns-Amendment of returns-Escaped assessments. 
A.  A seller may file an amended return with the borough, and the borough may accept the amended return, but only in the following circumstances: 
1.  The amended return is filed within one year of the original due date for the return; and 
2.  The seller provides justification in writing for requesting approval of the amended return; and 
3.  The seller was registered to collect sales tax during the period for which the amended return is filed and filed an original return for that period; and 
4.  The seller agrees to submit to an audit upon request of the borough. 
B.  If the borough rejects an amended return, it shall give written notice to a seller, including the reason for the rejection.

5.18.560. - Returns/records/audit-Records-Seller recordkeeping required-Loss of records. 
A.  Every seller engaged in activity subject to this chapter shall keep and preserve suitable records of all sales made by the seller and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax which he is obliged to collect. Every seller shall preserve suitable records of sales for a period of 3 years from the date of the return reporting such sales, and shall preserve for a period of 3 years all invoices of goods and merchandise purchased for resale, and all such other books, invoices and records as may be necessary to accurately determine the amount of taxes which the seller was obliged to collect under this chapter. 
B.  A seller shall immediately notify the borough of any fire, theft or other casualty which prevents his or her compliance with this chapter. The casualty constitutes a defense to any penalty provided in this chapter if determined to be the proximate cause of the failure to comply for a given reporting period, but does not excuse the seller from liability for taxes due. Accidental loss of funds or records is not a defense against the penalties of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 94-27, § 17, 1994; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 88-40, § 22, 1988; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985)

B.  A seller required to register for sales tax collection under this chapter consents to the inspection of the seller's federal income tax returns in order to determine the seller's compliance with this chapter. 
C.  If the borough is unable to ascertain the amount of tax due from a seller because the seller has failed to keep accurate records, has failed or refused to allow an audit or inspection of records, has failed to file a return, has falsified records or, has improperly calculated the tax, then the borough may estimate the tax due based upon any information available to it. The borough shall send a written notice of the estimated tax due to the seller, and of the assessment of an audit estimate fee. 
D.  The results of any examination or audit performed under this section shall be reported in writing to the seller. 
(Ord. No. 94-27, § 18, 1994; Ord. No. 90-48, § 1(part), 1990; Ord. No. 84-74, § 1(part), 1985)

2.  The seller's reasons for challenging the examination or audit results.

5.18.600. - Enforcement-Civil and criminal actions-Payment agreements-Joint bank accounts-Offset. 
A.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing the borough from filing and maintaining an action at law to recover any taxes, penalties, interest, and fees due from a seller. Failure to register under this chapter or to collect taxes which otherwise should have been collected under this chapter shall not be a defense to an action by the borough against such seller to recover all amounts due. Each act prohibited in this chapter constitutes a separate cause of action or offense. 
B.  The mayor may enter into an agreement secured by a confession of judgment or a deed of trust on property with sufficient equity to cover the liability for delinquent sales taxes on such payment terms as the administration finds reasonable, provided that the terms shall require full payment of all obligations of the seller within a maximum period of 24 months from entry of such an agreement, unless a shorter term is required by other provisions of this code, in which case those provisions shall be followed. The mayor shall not enter into a repayment agreement with a seller who has been involved in two repayment agreements within the prior five (5) years, unless otherwise provided in this code.

B.  A seller who fails to file a return within the time required by this chapter, or who fails to remit all taxes collected by him, or later found to be due, is subject to a civil penalty of 5% per month of the amount of taxes found to be due, to a maximum of 10 percent. The filing of an incomplete return, or the failure to remit all taxes, is the equivalent of filing no return. All taxes due but not paid within the time required by this chapter shall accrue and be assessed an interest charge at the rate of 10 percent per annum. 
C.  Any seller who fails to file a return required under this chapter within fifteen (15) days of written notification by regular mail, regardless of whether any taxes were due for the reporting period for which the return was required, shall be subject to a penalty of $25.00 for each return not filed, in addition to any penalty for late filing. 
D.  Sellers who have not filed returns for two (2) consecutive reporting periods shall be assumed to have ceased conducting business and shall be removed from the roll of active businesses. Reinstatement of a business removed from the active roll by this section shall require the payment of a mandatory reinstatement fee.

F.  As soon as practicable after the expiration of thirty days following the end of each calendar quarter, the borough shall publish in a newspaper of general or customary circulation in the appropriate area of the borough, a list of every seller who:

B.  Adult Day Care Centers. The number of persons served by each adult day care center shall be ten percent of individuals over 60 years old within the election precincts being served by the adult day care center, as determined by the last census count that has a count of individuals over 60 years of age.

The contents of the notice shall be sufficient to inform interested readers of the general nature of the supplies, services or construction being procured and the procedure for submitting a bid. 
C.  The purchasing officer, at the request of the agency head, may provide for a pre-bid conference.

B.  The borough may reject any or all bids if the mayor determines that it is in the best interest of the borough. 
C.  If the lowest qualified, responsive and responsible bid exceeds the amount of funds certified by the certifying officer to be available for the procurement, and if sufficient additional funds are not made available, the scope of the procurement may be reduced to bring its estimated cost within the amount of available funds. The purchasing officer shall issue a new invitation for bids for the reduced procurement, or, upon finding that the efficient operation of the borough government requires that the contract be awarded without delay, he may negotiate with the three lowest qualified, responsive and responsible bidders, starting first with the lowest bidder and then proceeding with the second and third lowest bidders; and may award, or recommend to the assembly for award, the reduced contract to the best negotiated proposal, except where prohibited by state and federal grant conditions or where another procedure has been specified in this chapter.

A.  If the mayor determines that use of competitive bidding is not practicable or if the procurement is for professional services, the borough may procure supplies, services, professional services, or construction by competitive sealed proposals under this section. Competitive, as used in this section, means evaluation and selection based on the factors specified in this chapter and the request for proposal, and not solely on price. 
B.  The purchasing officer or designee shall solicit proposals by issuing a request for proposals. The request for proposals shall be prepared by the requesting agency and shall state, or incorporate by reference, all specifications and contractual terms and conditions to which a proposal must respond, and shall state the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and the relative importance of those factors. Public notice of a request for proposals shall be given in accordance with Section 5.28.210(B) of this code. One or more preproposal conferences may be held by the purchasing officer, at the request of the agency head. A request for proposals may be modified or interpreted only in written addenda issued by the purchasing officer, at the request of the agency head. 
C.  Sealed proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in KPB 5.28.210(D) and (E). Proposals not submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in KPB 5.28.210(D) and (E) shall not be opened or considered. 
D.  Proposals shall be received at the time and place designated in the request for proposals, and shall be opened so as to avoid disclosing their contents to competing proponents during the process of negotiation. Notwithstanding Section 5.28.210 of this code, proposals and tabulations thereof shall be open to public inspection only after the contract award. 
E.  In the manner provided in the request for proposals, the purchasing officer, at the request of the agency head, or agency head, may negotiate with those qualified and responsible proponents whose proposals are determined by the purchasing officer and agency head to be reasonably responsive to the request for proposals. Negotiations shall be used to clarify and assure full understanding of the requirements of the request for proposals. The purchasing officer, at the request of the agency head, may permit proponents to revise their proposals after submission and prior to award to obtain best and final offers. Proponents deemed eligible for negotiations shall be treated equally regarding any opportunity to discuss and revise proposals. In conducting negotiations and requesting revisions, neither the purchasing officer nor any other borough officer or employee shall disclose any information derived from proposals of competing proponents. 
F.  Awards shall be made by written notice to the qualified and responsible proponent whose final proposal is determined to be most advantageous to the borough. No criteria other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in proposal evaluation. If the mayor determines that it is in the best interest of the borough to do so, the borough may reject any and all proposals. 
(Ord. No. 2016-34 , § 4, 10-11-16; Ord. No. 87-29, § 1(part), 1987) 
5.28.255. - Innovative procurements. 
A.  A contract may be awarded for supplies, services, professional services, or construction using an innovative procurement process, with or without competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals. A contract may be awarded under this section only when the mayor or his designee determines in writing that it is advantageous to the borough to use an innovative competitive procurement process in the procurement of new or unique requirements of the borough, new technologies, or to achieve best value. This process is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the borough to consider an award to other than the lowest priced offer or other than the highest technically rated offer. 
B.  To utilize an innovative procurement procedure the requesting department shall submit: 
1.  A detailed procurement plan to the purchasing officer for review and approval before public notice is issued as required under KPB 5.28.210(B). The plan shall, at a minimum, address the method of solicitation, scope, method of award, protest procedures, and proposed contract provisions. If the plan is submitted for a construction contract, the plan may address the use of a bonus in lieu of preferences; and 
2.  An explanation of how use of this procedure will achieve the best value, or why it is advantageous to the borough. To the maximum extent allowed by law, costs and benefits associated with the location of the bidder may be considered in determining the best value for the borough. 
C.  When using the process authorized in this section, all of the following apply: 
1.  The mayor or his designee must first approve the use of the proposed innovative procurement plan. 
2.  All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be clearly stated in the solicitation. 
3.  The solicitation shall state whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price. 
4.  In developing evaluation factors, generally, where the requirement is clearly definable and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, cost or price may play a dominant role in source selection. The less definitive the requirement, the more development work required, or the greater the performance risk, the more technical or past performance considerations may play a dominant role in source selection. 
D.  A procurement under this section is subject to the applicable requirements of KPB 5.28.210(B), KPB 5.28.250 (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F), and other requirements of the borough purchasing code not inconsistent with this section.

If practicable, at least three bids or proposals shall be solicited for any procurement estimated to exceed $5,000.00, and the bids or proposals shall be submitted in writing. 
C.  Awards for supplies services and construction shall be made by the purchasing officer to the lowest responsive, qualified and responsible bidder. All bids and proposals shall be tabulated and held in the office of the purchasing officer for public inspection for a period of not less than 30 days.

CHAPTER 5.35. - SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS-PUBLIC UTILITIES 

5.35.010. - Assessment authority. 
    This chapter is enacted under the authority of and in conformance with chapter 29.46 of the Alaska Statutes, to provide for the establishment of special assessment procedures. Under this authority the borough assembly may assess against private real property and/or the property of a governmental unit all or a portion of the cost of constructing or improving those capital projects of local benefit as described hereunder. As provided by AS 29.46.020, these procedures set out through KPB Chapter 5.35 shall replace and supersede the procedures set out by AS 29.46.030-AS 29.46.100. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.020. - Authorized capital improvements. 
    Special assessments may be utilized solely for financing of the extension of the lines of service of those public utilities regulated by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, or of city-owned utilities to areas outside the boundaries of the city. Special assessments are not available for the construction and financing of private hookups or service connections running from the utility's main line to private structures or facilities to be served on the benefitted parcels. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 1, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.030. - Initiation of improvement proposal-Preclearance-Resubmission. 
A.  When a petition application is submitted by a project sponsor, the boundaries of the district shall be approved following these steps: 
1.  A special assessment district proposal shall be initiated by submitting a complete application and a map or detailed description of the proposed geographic area subject to inclusion in the special assessment district to the borough assessor or assessor's designee. Any property owner interested in bringing the public utility improvement to their property or neighborhood can initiate the process. 
2.  Upon receipt of the application and map or description, the assessor or the assessor's designee shall review the materials to determine whether the proposed boundary is proper. The boundary will be considered improper if: 
a.  any property adjacent to the proposed district will be benefited by the proposed utility and is clearly excluded for the primary purpose of enabling the included properties to meet assessment percentage and signature requirements of this chapter; 
b.  the boundary covers a large, non-contiguous area, such as parcels unconnected by roadways, utility easements or property boundaries; or 
c.  the boundary includes too many parcels with the intention of diluting costs or minimizing the effect of delinquent properties; or 
d.  such other grounds as may be established by regulation or administrative policy. 
3.  If the assessor makes a preliminary finding that the boundary is proper, s/he shall then obtain the approval of the borough mayor to submit the proposed boundary to the utility whose service is sought. 
4.  Once the assessor and mayor both approve the boundary, the assessor shall consult with the utility whose service is sought to be extended and obtain written acknowledgment that the proposed boundary meets the requirements of the utility, that the utility approves and will support construction of the extension, and a written estimate of the utility's total cost of constructing the extension. 
5.  If the utility company approves the project as described in subsection (A)(4), the assessor shall contact the sponsor and inform him/her of the assessor's approval and the utility's cost estimate. 
B.  In the event that the assessor determines the proposed boundary is improper, the boundary description shall be returned to the sponsor along with a written explanation describing why the proposed boundary has been deemed improper. The sponsor may modify and resubmit the boundary description to the assessor for approval as described in Section A above. 
C.  If the proposed boundary is approved under KPB 5.35.030(A), the sponsor may provide written notice to the assessing department of intent to proceed with full administrative review of the petition report under KPB 5.35.105. 
D.  A non-refundable filing fee as established in the most current Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees under KPB chapter 1.26 shall be submitted with the sponsor's notice to proceed with administrative review. 
E.  After the written notice to proceed and filing fee are received by the assessing department from the sponsor, the assessing department shall provide notice of the proposed USAD to all parcel owners within the proposed USAD by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall include the following: 
1.  a description of the special assessment district and proposed improvement; 
2.  a map of the proposed improvement; 
3.  the timeframe for the mayor to complete the administrative review pursuant to KPB 5.35.105(C); 
4.  notice that the legal description of parcels within the proposed district as of the date the mayor approves the petition report will be used to determine assessments per KPB 5.35.070(B). Any action to replat parcels within the proposed district shall be completed and recorded before the date the mayor approves the petition report under KPB 5.35.105(C); and 
5.  notice that parcel owners shall submit any comments, including objections to their parcel's inclusion in the proposed district, in writing within 45 days of the date the assessing department mails the notices under this section, in order to be considered in the mayor's review of the petition report pursuant to KPB 5.35.105. Comments may be submitted via mail, hand-delivery, email, or facsimile. The date the assessing department receives the written comment will determine whether that comment has been timely submitted. 
F.  If any changes are made to the proposed district boundary by the sponsor after the assessing department receives the sponsor's written intent to proceed with administrative review of the proposed district, the revised district shall be subject to all steps for preclearance and resubmission of the proposed district as provided in KPB 5.35.030. The sponsor will not be required to submit an additional filing fee. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 2, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992)

5.35.060. - Administration-Regulations-Procedures. 
    The mayor may adopt regulations, subject to assembly approval, setting out such requirements and procedures as deemed necessary for the efficient administration of this program. The assessing department shall be responsible for the processing of petitions and development of an assessment roll for the special assessment district. The finance department shall be responsible for the sale of any bonds and collection of assessments. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.070. - Property assessed-Restrictions on formation. 
A.  The assembly may assess for an improvement any real property, or any interest in real property, directly benefitted by the improvement. The property to be assessed may include any property which is otherwise for any reason exempt from taxation by law. 
B.  The legal description of parcels within the proposed district as of the date of the mayor's approval of the petition report under KPB 5.35.105 will establish the parcels for assessment. No subdivision, reversion of acreage, or lot line adjustment will be recognized for USAD assessment purposes after the mayor's approval of the petition report. In the event a property owner seeks to subdivide a benefited parcel after the date of the mayor's approval of the petition report or after costs are assessed under this chapter, the property owner shall be required pay off the remaining balance of the assessment, or prepay estimated costs if the final assessment has not been determined, prior to approval of the final plat pursuant to KPB 20.60.030. If prepayment of the estimated cost of the assessment is required, the subdividing property owner shall be issued a refund for any amount in excess of the prepaid estimated cost over the final assessment. If the petition or project fails for any reason, the borough shall refund the prepayment. If a final plat is not approved pursuant to KPB 20.60.030 and the subdividing property owner requests a refund of the prepayment in writing within 30 days of denial of the final plat, the borough shall refund the prepayment. If the estimated costs are less than the final assessment the subdividing property owner shall be responsible for payment of the difference, due within 30 days of the final assessment. 
C.  In no case may a property be assessed an amount in excess of 50 percent of the fair market value of the property. 
For the purposes of this restriction, the estimated amount of the special assessment lien against a parcel will be reduced by the amount of a prepayment of the assessment for the parcel that is received by the borough before the assembly acts on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. Any such payment shall be received no later than the close of business at least 15 days prior to the date the assembly is scheduled to act on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. If the assembly does not approve the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement, the borough shall refund the prepayment. 
D.  In no case shall a special assessment district be approved for formation by the assembly under KPB 5.35.110 where properties which will bear more than 10 percent of the estimated costs of the improvement are subject to unpaid, past-due borough property taxes at the time the assembly approves the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. 
For the purposes of this restriction, the delinquent tax may be paid before the assembly acts on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. Any such payment shall be received no later than the close of business at least 15 days prior to the date the assembly will act on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. 
E.  A special assessment district may not be formed under this chapter if one owner owns more than 40 percent of the total number of parcels to be benefited. 
(Ord. No. 2018-27 , § 1, 9-4-18; Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 3, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 2001-03, § 1, 4-3-01; Ord. No. 96-38, § 2, 1996; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.080. - Costs assessed. 
    The assembly shall assess one hundred percent of all costs of a public improvement against the parcels of property directly benefitted by the improvement, less any costs prepaid prior to assessment. The total costs for an improvement shall include the actual costs of the improvement, including costs of acquisition of interest in land necessary for the improvement, design, engineering, administrative costs, professional services, bond costs, financing costs, and interest incurred as a result of the improvement, and all other costs resulting from the construction of the improvement. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 96-38, § 3, 1996; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.090. - Method of assessment. 
    The method of assessment shall be an allocation of costs on a per parcel basis so that each benefitted parcel is charged an equal amount. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 4, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 97-23, § 1, 1997; Ord. No. 96-38, § 4, 1996; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.100. - Financing special assessment districts. 
    The mechanism for financing of special assessment districts shall be determined on a case by case basis and set out and approved by the assembly in the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement adopted for each respective special assessment district. 
(Ord. No. 2015-12 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 5, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 94-26, § 1(part), 1994; Ord. No. 92-16, § 1(part), 1992) 
5.35.105. - Preparation and review of petition report. 
A.  After the sponsor gives notice of intent to proceed with administrative review of the proposed USAD, the assessor or assessor's designee shall prepare a petition report for the mayor's approval. The petition report shall include the following information: 
1.  a description of the proposed improvement; 
2.  the total estimated cost of the improvement supported by a written statement from the utility constructing the improvement; 
3.  a map showing the boundary of the proposed district; 
4.  the estimated roll: 
a.  the total estimated cost of the improvement; 
b.  the name of the record owner of each parcel in the proposed district; 
c.  the tax parcel number of each parcel in the proposed district; 
d.  the legal description of each parcel in the proposed district; 
e.  the assessed valuation of each parcel in the proposed district; 
f.  an estimate of the amount to be assessed to each parcel in the proposed district; 
g.  whether there are other special assessment liens against any of the parcels in the proposed district; and 
h.  a description of any parcels that violate the restrictions listed in KPB 5.35.070(C) or (D); 
5.  all written comments timely received per KPB 5.35.030(E)(5), including any objections from parcel owners regarding inclusion of their property in the proposed district; 
6.  the method of proposed financing for the improvement; and 
7.  the name, address and daytime telephone number of the sponsor. 
B.  The mayor shall exclude from the proposed district any real property, or any interest in real property, that is not directly benefitted by the improvement. If a property owner claims the physical characteristics of his or her property make it legally impermissible, physically impossible, or financially infeasible to develop or improve it in a manner that would enable the property to benefit from the proposed improvement, the property owner has the burden of demonstrating that the property cannot be developed or improved. 
1.  Factors that may allow a parcel to be excluded from the district include, but are not limited to, the utility company's inability to provide service to the parcel via main line, and plat restrictions on development. 
2.  For the purposes of this section, "financially infeasible" means the cost to develop the property would exceed the increase in value due to development. 
C.  The mayor will consider the petition report and make a final determination to approve the report or to require additional or amended information not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days from the date the assessing department mails notice to affected property owners under KPB 5.35.030(E) to allow for the comment period described in that section.

A.  The principal of the special assessment lien on real property owned and occupied as the primary residence and permanent place of abode by a resident who is economically disadvantaged may be deferred as provided in this section. The deferral of payment on the principal of the special assessment lien means that such payment will be postponed, but not forgiven. 
B.  For purposes of this section, a resident is economically disadvantaged if the person's adjusted gross income is less than 200 percent of the current U.S. Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines for Alaska. 
C.  Interest shall continue to accrue on the assessment during the period of deferral. 
D.  Property owners wishing to seek a deferral of the assessment shall submit a form prescribed by the finance director or designee no later than February 1 of each calendar year to certify that the conditions described in this section continue to exist. 
E.  Deferral is for the principal balance only. Individuals who qualify for the deferral shall pay the accrued interest by the due date each year. 
F.  The deferred assessment, including all unpaid accrued interest, becomes due and payable in full when the property ceases to be owned or occupied by the resident who qualified for the deferral. Any remaining balance due shall be paid on the same schedule as would have been in place if no deferral had applied. 
G.  If the resident who previously qualified for the deferral no longer qualifies, but continues to own and occupy the property, then payments on the principal shall resume starting with the next payment due. 
H.  Deferral applications filed after February 1 may only be accepted and considered as follows: 
1.  Deferral applications filed after February 1 of the calendar year must be accompanied by a signed affidavit stating good cause for failure to comply with the February 1 filing deadline. If a qualified claimant files an untimely application, the mayor is delegated the authority, for good cause shown, to waive the individual's failure to make timely application and to authorize the finance director to accept the application as if timely filed. 
2.  This authority to grant extensions cannot be exercised to allow acceptance of a deferral application for any years prior to the current year. If the extension is granted the application must be filed with the finance department and this filing must occur within the year for which the deferral is sought. 
3.  Good cause for failure to comply with the deadline must be based upon a serious condition or event beyond the property owner's control. For purposes of this subsection, a serious condition or event may include a serious medical condition or other similar serious condition or event that prevented the property owner from timely filing the application. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a failure to pick up or read mail, or to make arrangements for an appropriate and responsible person to pick up or read mail, or a failure to timely provide a current address to the finance department will not be deemed to be good cause.

For each property the statement shall designate the property, the total allocated assessment, the assessment lien amount, the schedule of payments, the time of delinquency, penalties, and notice of the deferral of principal option described in KPB 5.35.155. The statement shall also include notice that if a benefited parcel is subdivided following the date of the mayor's approval of the petition report under this chapter, the property owner shall be required to pay off the remaining balance of the assessment, or prepay estimated costs if the final assessment has not been determined, prior to approval of the final plat pursuant to KPB 20.60.030. Additionally, the statement shall include notice that the ordinance of assessment is the final determination of the assessment, and any property owner who filed a written objection to the assessment roll before its confirmation in that ordinance may appeal the decision of the assembly on their objection to the superior court within 30 days after the date the assessment roll was confirmed.

C.  Financial Security for Warranty. Applicants for maintenance of roads preliminarily approved for maintenance must provide the RSA with security to guarantee the payment of any repair or reconstruction costs undertaken by the RSA or its agents due to any road failures, defects, or deficiencies that occur during the warranty period. Once acceptable security is received, the road will be certified for maintenance. 
1.  The RSA will notify the applicant in writing of preliminary approval of the applicant's road(s) for maintenance at the applicant's last known address. Within 30 days after notification of approval for maintenance is sent, the applicant must furnish the RSA with acceptable security for the warranty to remain in effect for one year. 
2.  If acceptable security is not furnished within the applicable time frame, the road will not be certified for maintenance, and the applicant cannot reapply for maintenance certification for the same road(s) until the following calendar year. 
3.  Security covering ten percent of the construction costs for the project shall be accepted in any one of the following forms: 
a.  A bond in the required security amount issued by a qualified corporate surety licensed to do business in Alaska. The bond shall be payable to the Borough in the event that any reconstruction or repairs are required for road failures, defects, or deficiencies that occur during the warranty period. 
b.  A cashier's check or certified check in the required security amount. The funds shall be held in trust and returned after the expiration of the warranty period less any costs necessary for reconstruction or repair of any road failures, defects, or deficiencies that occur during the warranty period. 
c.  A deposit of a cash sum in the required security amount into an escrow account with a responsible financial institution authorized to do such business in Alaska. The applicant shall provide an escrow agreement to the Borough that includes the following terms: the funds shall be held in trust until released by the Borough; the funds may not be used or pledged as other security; and the funds shall be available to the Borough for any costs incurred for reconstruction or repair of any road failures, defects, or deficiencies that occur during the warranty period.

14.06.240. - Road decertification. 
A.  Authority. Roads may be decertified for maintenance by the Borough as provided in this section. 
B.  Procedure. Any road decertification must comply with the following procedures: 
1.  Staff recommendation. The RSA director or designee shall make a written recommendation to the RSA board with findings based on the standards set forth in KPB 14.06.240(C), (D), and (E). In support of the recommendation, the RSA director or designee must submit a report including: 
a.  Description of efforts to bring the road to RSA standards under KPB 14.06 and explanation of why it is not feasible or in the best interests of the borough to do so. 
b.  Narrative of considerations given to alternatives to decertification including but not limited to: 
i.  Description of necessary construction upgrades needed to avoid decertification, and any other feasible alternatives evaluated by the RSA director or designee including estimated costs. 
ii.  Feasibility of forming a special assessment district pursuant to KPB Chapter 14.31, if applicable. 
iii.  Cooperative efforts between the Borough and property owners to upgrade roads to the extent allowed by law where property owners contribute material, equipment, professional services, and right-of-way for the project. 
c.  Information regarding any relevant communication with affected property owners, including but not limited to in-person, telephone, electronic and written contact. Any written comments from residents regarding the proposed decertification submitted before the RSA packet deadline must be included with the report. 
d.  Any other relevant information that the RSA director or designee has obtained and which may assist the RSA board's consideration of the proposed decertification. 
2.  Notice and hearing. A public hearing shall be held before the RSA board regarding decertification. Notice of the hearing shall be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the borough prior to hearing with the last publication appearing within 14 days before the hearing date. A notice of the decertification hearing shall also be posted for a four-week period prior to the date of the first hearing at the beginning and ending points of the road proposed for decertification. 
a.  Both posted and written notices shall invite public comment, state the name and phone number of a contact person regarding decertification information, state the date, place, and time of the public hearing, and a deadline for the submittal of written comments. 
b.  The deadline for submission of written objections shall be 4 PM on the Monday of the week immediately preceding the week of the RSA meeting. 
3.  Board action. 
a.  If the RSA board finds that the proposed road meets the decertification standards set forth in KPB 14.06.240(C), (D) and (E), and there has been no written objection to the decertification, it may by resolution decertify the road. 
b.  If timely written objections are received by the RSA board, decertification requires assembly action. If the RSA board finds that there is no viable option presented to bring the road to borough standards or otherwise finds that there is no safe alternative to decertification, the RSA board, by resolution, shall recommend to the assembly decertification of the road. 
4.  Decertification withdrawal. If the road has been brought to borough standards or the RSA director identifies a viable plan for bringing the road to borough standards or to an appropriate level of safety prior to the RSA board or assembly hearing regarding decertification, the RSA director may withdraw the proposed decertification recommendation from RSA board or assembly consideration. Notice of a withdrawal under these circumstances must be reported to the RSA board at the subsequent RSA meeting. 
5.  Assembly-Hearing required. A public hearing shall be held before the assembly regarding a decertification recommended by the RSA board that is subject to objections as set forth in KPB 14.06.240(B)(3)(b), in conjunction with consideration of a decertification resolution. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week during each of the two calendar weeks prior to the hearing. 
6.  Assembly action. If the assembly finds that the road is eligible for decertification based on consideration of the standards established by KPB 14.06.240(C), (D) and (E), the assembly shall decertify the road. If the decertification resolution is adopted by the assembly between September 15 and May 15, the decertification shall not be effective before May 16, unless the road has not received maintenance within five years prior to assembly decertification. 
7.  Signage. Decertification shall not be effective until signage has been placed regarding discontinued maintenance, if the road has received maintenance within five years prior to the assembly resolution. 
C.  Safety standards. Safety shall be a primary consideration regarding a proposed decertification. The RSA board will review whether maintenance can provide adequate grade, width for travel, room for snow removal, adequate sight distances and clear zone, and prevent accumulation of water and snow in the traveled right-of-way. The potential for accidents because of inability to maintain the road to a safe standard on a regular basis shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
D.  Dwellings standards. No borough road shall be decertified which provides the only vehicular access to dwellings. Dwellings are structures currently habitable by human beings, either for residential or recreational purposes. 
E.  Additional standards. The following standards support, but each alone does not require, decertification: 
1.  Road condition. Whether the types of road material, soils, terrain, road surface, and width of right-of-way do not meet borough road standards shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
2.  Drainage problems. Whether a road has inadequate ditching, culverts, and drainage causing water to accumulate on the road surface or which undermines the road bed shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
3.  Access. Whether roads are outside a dedicated right-of-way and whether substandard roads on the maintenance system are accessed by a state- or borough-maintained road shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
4.  Snow storage. Whether snow easements or places to store snow are inadequate to maintain sufficient travel width and vision shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
5.  Funding. Excessive cost of maintaining a particular substandard road shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
6.  Prior maintenance. Whether the borough road has ever received either summer or winter maintenance shall be considered in a decertification determination. 
F.  Vacations. Notwithstanding KPB 14.06.240(B), a right of way that is vacated through the process set forth in KPB 20.70 shall be decertified for maintenance by resolution of the RSA board. 
G.  Alternate route. Notwithstanding KPB 14.06.240(B), any portion of a road that has been maintained outside of dedicated right-of-way may be decertified for maintenance by resolution of the RSA board where the travel surface has been moved into the right-of-way and the new travel surface is certified for maintenance by the Borough. 
H.  Decertification of private land subject to maintenance. Notwithstanding KPB 14.06.240(B), any portion of a private drive or road that has been maintained by the borough may be decertified upon reasonable notice to the property owner. 
1.  The RSA board may, by resolution, decertify a private drive or road from further maintenance. 
2.  The RSA director or designee shall inform the property owner, in writing, of the intent to cease maintenance of the private drive or road via decertification at least 30 days before the date of the RSA meeting at which the matter of decertification will be considered.

14.08.070. - Utility locations within the right-of-way. 
A.  All utility facilities shall be placed within either of two 10-foot wide corridors located along the outer portions of each side of the right-of-way, i.e. ten feet as measured from the edge of the right-of-way toward the centerline of the right-of-way. If only half of the right-of-way has been dedicated, utilities placed within the right-of-way shall be placed only within the ten feet of the right-of-way adjacent to the subdivided lots or tracts from which the right-of-way was created. 
B.  Exceptions to assigned utility locations: 
1.  Whenever a utility finds it unreasonable to place its facilities within their assigned area, it may apply for an exception on a form provided by the borough planning department and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
a.  A complete explanation as to why the utility is requesting an exception from its assigned location within the right-of-way; 
b.  Additional plans, drawings or sketches necessary to show locations of other existing utilities, problem areas such as rock or wetlands, and locations where the utility is proposing to place new facilities; and, 
c.  Evidence that the request for an exception has been reviewed and approved by all other affected utilities. 
2.  Subject to appeal to the planning commission, the borough planning director or his designee has authority to grant an exception to the assigned utility location within the borough right-of-way. 
3.  Requests for exceptions that become necessary and evident during actual ongoing construction shall be deemed approved if not rejected or modified within four (4) normal working hours after receipt by the borough planning department. It is a utility's responsibility to inquire if the request for an exception has been approved, rejected or modified. 
(Ord. No. 94-56, § 1(part), 1995) 
14.08.080. - Prior existing installations-Maintenance-Relocation-Costs. 
A.  Utility facilities, within a right-of-way subject to this chapter, installed prior to the effective date of this ordinance may remain in place as installed unless relocation of the prior existing utility is required for the installation or construction of a road or another utility within the right-of-way. In the event that such relocation is required, the relocated facility must comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The release from compliance granted under this section does not create the presumption the existing facility was properly or reasonably installed. Further while this release allows maintenance of existing facilities for their useful life, except as otherwise provided herein, it does not authorize an upgrade or relocation of the existing facility without complying with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Responsibility, if any, for the cost of relocation shall be determined in accordance with rulings of the Alaska Public Utilities Commission and any tariffs approved under its rules. 
(Ord. No. 94-56, § 1(part), 1995)

CHAPTER 14.20. - UNIFORM STREET ADDRESSING SYSTEM 

14.20.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish an official and uniform system of assigning a numerical address to all houses and buildings, existing and future, facing and gaining access from public streets as defined in KPB 14.10.020. This chapter only applies to the rural district in the borough. Addressing systems adopted by the incorporated cities within the borough are recognized and are not altered by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2006-05, § 4, 3-14-06; Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.020. - Addressing authority. 
    The mayor, or designee, shall cause the initial assignment of addresses. 
(Ord. No. 2006-05, § 5, 3-14-06; Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.030. - Address defined. 
    The term address as used in this chapter means a logical number assigned to houses and buildings in sequential order along streets, as defined in Chapter 14.10, and serving as a distinct physical location for responding to an emergency and delivery of other public and private services. 
(Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.040. - Addressing system. 
A.  Numbering of addresses shall be based on a uniformly numbered grid system emanating in four quadrants from the primary north-south and east-west base lines described as follows: 
1.  The north-south base line is the line common to Ranges 4 and 5 West of the Seward Principal Meridian, Alaska. 
2.  The east-west base line is the line common to Townships 1 North and 1 South, being the Seward Base Line, Alaska. 
3.  The Seward Principal Meridian and the Seward Base Line are defined by the United States Rectangular Survey System. 
B.  The numerical values of the grid system shall be ordered as follows: 
1.  The primary base lines are assigned the value of 10000. 
2.  At each mile distant in cardinal directions from the base lines the grid is incremented by the value of 1,000, i.e. a location that is 5 miles north of the east-west base line bears the grid address of north 15,000 and a location that is 20 miles east of the north-south base line bears the grid address of east 20000. 
3.  There being 1,000 numbers to each mile provides the means to accurately establish an individual address for houses and buildings within a tolerance of 5.28 feet. For example, a house that is located on an east-west street 2,350 feet westerly of grid mile west 33,000 would be correctly addressed by the formula: 
2,350 ° (5280°1000) = 445 + 33000 = 33445. Thus 33445 is the correct address for that location on any east-west street west of the primary north-south base line. 
C.  Individual addresses shall be assigned using the following conventions: 
1.  If there is constructed access to the property, the number shall be assigned based upon the street to which access to the property has been constructed. If access has not been constructed, or if it has been constructed to more than one street, then the address shall be determined using the street most directly faced by the main entrance to the primary improvement on the property. If the property is not improved and no access has been constructed, then the address will be determined using the street to which the property has the most frontage. In any event, if the access crosses another parcel with no dedicated right-of-way, the property owner must provide a copy of a recorded easement or proof thereof to receive a number based upon the street to which access has been constructed. 
2.  Houses and buildings on the northerly and easterly sides of streets shall have even numbers. 
3.  Houses and buildings on the southerly and westerly sides of streets shall have odd numbers. 
4.  Houses and buildings on corner lots shall have an address determined primarily by the location of the main constructed access to a street. 
5.  Apartment houses with a common entrance shall have one address. 
6.  Buildings with multiple entrances by one common address point shall have an individual address for each individual primary entrance per parcel. The owner may assign additional sequential letters or other identifiers in accordance with postal addressing standards for each primary entrance. 
D.  Curvilineal or winding streets and loop streets, not conforming to the cardinal grid, shall be addressed according to the following: 
1.  The initial and thereafter the dominant direction of the street shall control which axis of the grid will be used to calculate the beginning number. 
2.  The addresses shall be numbered sequentially along the street, based on the distance from the initial address, regardless of change in direction. 
3.  Individual addresses shall be assigned according to the convention under KPB 14.20.040(C). 
(Ord. No. 2006-05, § 6, 3-14-06; Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.050. - Pre-existing addresses. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 14.20.040, those addresses which have been previously established by a non-official agency and which have been posted, recognized and serve as adequate locational numbers shall be officially adopted to the extent possible. 
(Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.060. - Remote communities-Villages. 
A.  There are unincorporated communities and villages within the borough that are separated from the major populated area by a major topographic feature or distance. It is recognized that the grid system defined under KPB 14.20.040 may not be practicable or necessary for those remote locations. 
B.  For remote areas, the address shall consist of a number assigned from the grid in which the property primarily lies, followed by the name of the general location if there is a name. If there is no such name, then the U.S. Survey number shall be used instead. This name or number shall be followed by the quadrant within which the property is primarily located, and the address shall end with the term "REM." 
C.  Upon consideration of local concerns, future expansion, public safety, and delivery of services, the planning commission may establish a local system more suitable for the area using the following general guidelines: 
1.  If the layout of existing streets and topography is such that a local grid system is practicable, the axis of the grid should be established at a location which allows all addresses to lie in one quadrant of the grid. 
2.  In the absence of an acceptable grid system, an incremental numbering system may be employed for each individual street with the addresses emanating from an appropriate major thoroughfare. 
3.  There should be 1,000 numbers per mile, similar to KPB 14.20.040(B)(3). 
D.  All other provisions of this chapter shall apply regardless of what address system is adopted. 
(Ord. No. 2006-05, § 7, 3-14-06; Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.070. - Notification of address. 
    Upon completion of the initial assignment of addresses, and thereafter upon assignment of a new address, the mayor, or designee, shall provide notification of the assigned address to the owner or occupant in a timely and appropriate manner. 
(Ord. No. 92-09, § 2(part), 1992) 
14.20.080. - Address posting. 
    The owners, occupants, or other persons having responsibility for the houses and buildings to be addressed shall obtain and display in a prominent manner the correct numbers corresponding to the assigned address in accordance with the following: 
A.  The numbers should be a minimum of three inches in height and should be made of a durable, reflective, and clearly visible material which will provide a distinct contrast to the background on which the numbers are posted. 
B.  The numbers should be posted as near the entrance to the house or building as possible and affixed in a legible manner which is visible from the street. 
C.  In the case of long driveways and/or the presence of vegetation or other sight barriers which block the view of the structure from the street, the numbers should be placed on durable fixtures such as gates or fence posts at or near the driveway entrance. A tree may also serve this purpose. 
D.  Failure to post the numbers shall constitute a full and final release of liability from any and all claims the property owner or occupant may otherwise have against the borough relating to an emergency response and in any way related to the failure to comply with this section.

CHAPTER 14.31. - SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS-ROAD IMPROVEMENTS 

14.31.010. - Assessment authority. 
A.  Within the borough road service area, the borough may assess against the property of a state or federal governmental unit and private property to be benefitted by a capital improvement described in KPB 14.31.020 all or a portion of the cost of acquiring, installing or constructing the capital improvement. 
B.  Pursuant to AS 29.46.020(a) the procedures set out in KPB chapter 14.31 shall replace and supersede the procedures in AS 29.46.030 through 29.46.100. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997) 
14.31.020. - Authorized capital improvements. 
    Special assessments may be levied under this chapter for the improvement of existing roads or construction of new roads in public rights-of-way to meet or exceed road construction standards adopted in KPB Chapter 14.06 that are in effect at the time of the formation of the special assessment district in which the assessments are levied. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2009-05, § 1, 2-17-09; Ord. No. 2008-05(S), § 2, 5-6-08; Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997) 
14.31.030. - Property subject to assessment. 
    The assembly may assess any real property or interest in real property that the assembly determines is directly benefitted by an improvement. The real property or interest in real property that is benefitted by an improvement may be abutting, adjoining, adjacent, or contiguous to the improvement. Real property may be assessed for an improvement notwithstanding its exemption from taxation by law. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2001-05(S), § 2, 4-3-01) 
14.31.040. - Initiation of special assessment district. 
    To initiate a petition for the formation of a special assessment district, the sponsor of the proposed district submits an application and a map or detailed description of the proposed geographic area subject to inclusion in the special assessment district to the borough assessor or assessor's designee. Applications to form a road improvement assessment district (RIAD) and participate in the RIAD match program shall be received no later than July 1 of each year. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997) 
14.31.050. - Review of petition application. 
A.  District boundaries-Review by assessor and RSA director. After receiving an application for a petition to form a RIAD, the borough assessor or the assessor's designee, in consultation with the road service area director, shall determine whether the boundaries of the proposed district are proper. The boundary will be considered improper if: 
1.  any property adjacent to the proposed district will be benefited by the proposed improvement and is clearly excluded for the primary purpose of enabling the included properties to meet assessment percentage and signature requirements of this chapter; 
2.  the boundary covers a large, non-contiguous area, such as parcels unconnected by the roadway or property lines; 
3.  the boundary includes too many parcels with the intention of diluting costs or minimizing the effect of delinquent properties; or 
4.  such other grounds as may be established by regulation or administrative policy. 
B.  Based upon the proposed district boundaries, the borough assessor shall inform the sponsor whether the proposed district may violate any of the restrictions on district formation in KPB 14.31.080. 
C.  District boundaries-Deemed improper. In the event that the assessor determines the proposed boundary is improper, the boundary description shall be returned to the sponsor along with a written explanation describing why the proposed boundary has been deemed improper. The sponsor may modify and resubmit the boundary description to the assessor for approval as described in KPB 14.31.050(A). 
D.  Initial staff report. Once the assessor approves the boundaries of the proposed district, assessing and road service area staff will prepare an initial report for the road service area (RSA) board to consider for approval of an order for the engineer's estimate regarding the proposed project. The initial staff report shall contain the following information: 
1.  Sponsor's application, description of the subject road(s) and scope of the proposed project; 
2.  Review of KPB 14.31.080(A)(3) and (4) restrictions on formation for the proposed project; 
3.  Review of KPB 14.31.050(E) criteria for the proposed project; 
4.  Any additional comments that may help the RSA board evaluate the project; and 
5.  RSA staff recommendation for the proposed project. 
E.  RSA Board-Approval to proceed with engineer's estimate. The RSA board shall review the staff reports for all RIAD applications timely submitted under KPB 14.31.040 no later than September 1 of each year, for construction in the following year. The road service area board shall consider the following factors in evaluating petition applications and determining whether to approve an order for an engineer's estimate: 
1.  Whether the road is currently on the maintenance system; 
2.  The number of petitions for projects received that year; 
3.  The funds available in the RIAD engineer's estimate fund established under KPB 5.20.160; and 
4.  Whether an application for district formation has been previously filed and whether conditions have changed that make the project more feasible than in past application years. 
F.  RSA board-Administrative procedures. The RSA board may adopt administrative procedures for application of the factors set forth in KPB 14.31.050(E) by board resolution. 
G.  Non-refundable filing fee. Upon receiving notice that the RSA board has approved an order for an engineer's estimate under KPB 14.31.050(E), the sponsor must submit a non-refundable filing fee as described in the borough's Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees, before any additional efforts are made by the borough to proceed with the proposed district. 
H.  Engineer's estimate. After the sponsor submits the non-refundable filing fee, the road service area director or designee shall obtain an estimate of the cost of the improvement proposed for the district, referred to as the "engineer's estimate." The borough assessor shall re-evaluate whether the proposed district may violate any of the restrictions on district formation in KPB 14.31.080 taking into account the estimated costs, and inform the sponsor if any violations have been identified. 
I.  Sponsor's intent to proceed. If the sponsor wishes to proceed after receiving the engineer's estimate under KPB 14.31.030 (H), s/he must submit to the assessor a written notice of intent to proceed with the project.

3.  The number of applications for projects received that year; 
4.  The funds available in the Road Improvement Assessment District Match Fund; 
5.  Whether an application for district formation has been previously filed and whether conditions have changed to make the project more feasible than in past application years; 
6.  The number of residents served; 
7.  The number of parcels served; 
8.  The feasibility of the project's compliance with KPB 14.31.080 criteria regarding restrictions on formation; and

The signature of the trustee(s) will only be accepted by the clerk if it is accompanied by a copy of the trust document. 
6.  Kenai Peninsula Borough. The mayor shall be the designee for signing any petition when borough land is part of the proposed district. Where the Kenai Peninsula Borough abstains from participating in the petition signature process, the total number of parcels within the district, for the purpose of calculating the signature thresholds, will be reduced by the number of parcels owned by the borough within the proposed district. 
E.  A signature on a petition may be withdrawn only by written notice from the signer submitted to the assessing department prior to the final filing of the petition signatures by the sponsor. A withdrawal is effective only if notice of the withdrawal is submitted before the filing of the completed petition. 
F.  The sponsor shall timely submit the petition signatures to the borough assessor, who will provide the complete petition, along with supporting documentation, to the borough clerk. If the borough clerk finds that the petition contains sufficient signatures as described in KPB 14.31.070(D), the borough clerk shall certify the petition and submit the petition to the mayor, who will prepare a resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement under KPB 14.31.090 for assembly consideration.

14.31.080. - Restrictions on district formation. 
A.  A special assessment district may not be formed if it violates any of the following restrictions: 
1.  The estimated amount of the assessment to be levied against each parcel in the district may not exceed 21 percent for gravel improvements to an existing road, or 25 percent for paving improvements, or 40 percent for construction of a new road, of the current assessed value of the parcel. 
A.  For the purposes of this restriction, the estimated amount of the assessment against a parcel will be reduced by the amount of a prepayment of the assessment for the parcel that is received by the borough before the assembly acts on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. If the assembly does not approve the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement, the borough will refund the prepayment. 
B.  Any such prepayment must be received no later than the close of business at least 15 days prior to the date the assembly will act on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. 
2.  In no case shall a special assessment district be approved by the assembly where properties that will bear more than 10 percent of the estimated costs of the improvement are subject to unpaid, past-due borough property taxes at the time the assembly approves the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. 
For the purposes of this restriction, the delinquent tax may be paid before the assembly acts on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. Any such payment must be received no later than the close of business at least 15 days prior to the date the assembly will act on the resolution to form the district and proceed with the improvement. 
3.  A special assessment district for the upgrade of an existing road, including paving, may not be formed if unimproved parcels represent more than 40 percent of the total assessed value of real property in the district. A parcel is improved under this subsection if it contains operable water or waste-water disposal systems, or a structure assessed for more than $5,000. 
4.  For construction of new roads, a special assessment district may not be formed if one owner owns more than 40 percent of the parcels to be benefited. 
B.  The legal description of parcels within the proposed district as of the date of the RSA resolution to approve the petition report and recommend a borough match under KPB 14.31.065 will be used to determine assessment. No subdivision, reversion of acreage, or lot line adjustment will be recognized for RIAD assessment purposes after the RSA board issues the resolution under KPB 14.31.065. In the event a property owner seeks to subdivide a benefited parcel after the date of the RSA resolution or after costs are assessed under this chapter, the property owner shall be required to pay off the remaining balance of the assessment, or prepay estimated costs if the final assessment has not been determined, prior to approval of the final plat pursuant to KPB 20.60.030. If prepayment of the estimated cost of the assessment is required, the subdividing property owner shall be issued a refund for any amount in excess of the prepaid estimated cost over the final assessment. If the petition or project fails for any reason, the borough shall refund the prepayment. If a final plat is not approved pursuant to KPB 20.60.030 and the subdividing property owner requests a refund of the prepayment in writing within 30 days of denial of the final plat, the borough shall refund the prepayment. If the estimated costs are less than the final assessment the subdividing property owner shall be responsible for payment of the difference, due within 30 days of the final assessment approval.

14.31.110. - Costs assessed. 
    The assembly shall assess against the benefitted parcels any costs of the improvement that are allowable under AS 29.46.110, including without limitation costs of land acquisition necessary for the improvement, design, engineering, administrative costs, professional services, financing costs and interest; provided that the assessment allocated to a parcel shall be reduced by the amount of any prepayment for that parcel under KPB 14.31.080. Before the costs are allocated to the benefitted parcels under KPB 14.31.120, the amount of the approved borough match will be subtracted from the total cost of the improvement. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 2001-05(S), § 5, 4-3-01; Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997)

(Ord. No. 2018-27 , § 8, 9-4-18; Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997) 
14.31.140. - Special assessment financing. 
A.  Special assessment bonds. The borough may, by ordinance, authorize the issuance and sale of special assessment bonds to pay all or part of the cost of an improvement in a special assessment district. The principal and interest of bonds so issued shall be payable solely from the levy of special assessments against the property to be benefitted. The assessment shall constitute a sinking fund for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. Interest on funds borrowed to finance the improvement prior to the sale of special assessment bonds shall be a cost of the assessment district. 
B.  Borough Investment Funds. In conformance with KPB Chapter 5.10 on investment of borough funds, the assembly may authorize investment of borough moneys in special assessment districts to pay all or part of the cost of an improvement at an interest rate determined by the assembly. In all such cases, the properties benefitted shall stand as security for payment of the cost of improvements. 
(Ord. No. 97-32, § 2(part), 1997) 
14.31.145. - Deferral of payment of principal. 
A.  The principal of the special assessment lien on real property owned and occupied as the primary residence and permanent place of abode by a resident who is economically disadvantaged may be deferred as provided in this section. The deferral of payment on the principal of the special assessment lien means that such payment will be postponed, but not forgiven. 
B.  For purposes of this section, a resident is economically disadvantaged if the person's adjusted gross income is less than 200 percent of the current U.S. Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines for Alaska. 
C.  Interest will continue to accrue on the assessment during the period of deferral. 
D.  Property owners wishing to seek a deferral of the assessment must submit a form prescribed by the finance director or designee no later than February 1 of each calendar year to certify that the conditions described in this section continue to exist. 
E.  Deferral is for the principal balance only. Individuals who qualify for the deferral must pay the accrued interest by the due date each year. 
F.  The deferred assessment, including all unpaid accrued interest, becomes due and payable in full when the property ceases to be owned or occupied by the resident who qualified for the deferral. Any remaining balance due shall be paid on the same schedule as would have been in place if no deferral had applied. 
G.  If the resident who previously qualified for the deferral no longer qualifies, but continues to own and occupy the property, then payments on the principal will resume, starting with the next payment due. 
H.  Deferral applications filed after February 1 may only be accepted and considered as follows: 
1.  Deferral applications filed after February 1 of the calendar year must be accompanied by a signed affidavit stating good cause for failure to comply with the February 1 filing deadline. If a qualified claimant files an untimely application, the mayor is delegated the authority, for good cause shown, to waive the individual's failure to make timely application and to authorize the finance director to accept the application as if timely filed. 
2.  This authority to grant extensions cannot be exercised to allow acceptance of a deferral application for any years prior to the current year. If the extension is granted the application must be filed with the finance department and this filing must occur within the year for which the deferral is sought. 
3.  Good cause for failure to comply with the deadline must be based upon a serious condition or event beyond the property owner's control. For purposes of this subsection, a serious condition or event may include a serious medical condition or other similar serious condition or event that prevented the property owner from timely filing the application. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a failure to pick up or read mail, or to make arrangements for an appropriate and responsible person to pick up or read mail, or a failure to timely provide a current address to the finance department will not be deemed to be good cause.

14.31.150. - Reassessment. 
    When it appears to the assembly that a special assessment is invalid or when an assessment is adjudged to be illegal by a court, the assembly shall order a reassessment whether the improvement has been made or not. Proceedings for a reassessment and for the collection thereof, shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment.

2.  Project specific construction permits for crossing an anadromous waterbody within a dedicated right-of-way will only be issued upon receipt by the RSA director of applicant's written certification that s/he has obtained all other applicable permits for the project, including but not limited to permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska Department of Fish & Game, Alaska State Parks, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. It shall be the sole responsibility of all applicants for project-specific construction permits to ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal law, including permitting requirements. 
3.  Anadromous waterbody crossings and approaches shall be designed to withstand a 100-year flood event as defined by KPB 21.06.070. The crossing shall be designed by a licensed professional civil engineer. The design shall be presented to the RSA board for review and approval prior to construction. The engineer shall certify that the crossing and approaches are constructed to withstand a 100-year flood event. 
4.  Project specific permits issued pursuant to KPB 14.40.060 that permit work within a right-of-way within 250 feet of the ordinary high water mark on both sides of a dedicated crossing of an anadromous waterbody catalogued under AS 16.05.871 shall require a crossing to be constructed within the dedicated right-of-way as a permit condition. 
B.  Waterbodies. Right-of-way construction permits pursuant to KPB 14.40.040-14.40.060 will not be issued to construct any part of a road or driveway or other development within the right-of-way where the construction or development will be parallel and within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse or lake unless necessary for access to a lot where no reasonable alternative access exists or unless the road is for access to a bridge or public facility, waterbody, or watercourse. 
C.  Development conditions for rights-of-way accessing water bodies. No development within 100 feet of the high water mark of a waterbody within a right-of-way providing access to the waterbody may occur without a permit. All permits issued under this section shall be submitted to the RSA board for its consideration. A written RSA staff report shall be provided to the RSA board with every permit application. The staff report shall include comments from the planning department. The RSA board shall make written findings to support denial or issuance of the permit. There must be facts which support the following standards in order to issue a waterbody public access permit. 
1.  Any development in the right-of-way will not be detrimental to the waterbody, or any potential detriment is mitigated by conditions placed on the permit; 
2.  Any development in the right-of-way will not be detrimental to adjacent public or private property; and 
3.  The public benefit of development in the right-of-way outweighs the potential detriment to the public interest caused by the development. Any detriment to the public interest must be mitigated through permit conditions to the maximum extent reasonably possible.

D.  Citizen maintenance shall limit interference with the traveling public, and shall not create a hazard to the road, the traveling public, or adjacent properties. The RSA director may require security in the form of a bond, certificate of deposit, or certified check or other practical means to ensure compliance with the terms of these permit procedures. The citizen shall hold the borough harmless for the maintenance that is the subject of the permit. 
E.  The RSA director shall issue approvals or denials of applications for citizen road maintenance. If the basis for denial is that the project constitutes construction, and not maintenance, the applicant shall be advised of the right-of-way construction permit process. 
F.  There shall be no fee for citizen maintenance applications.

D.  A permit fee shall be charged for encroachment permits as provided in the current approved Kenai Peninsula Borough Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees. A person who fails to apply for and obtain an encroachment permit prior to an enforcement notice being issued pursuant to KPB 14.40.330(A) shall pay a double permit fee. 
E.  Unauthorized encroachments shall be subject to removal by the owner upon being given notice by the borough. Notice shall consist of a tag placed on the property allowing 48 hours to remove the encroachment. If the owner does not remove the encroachment after being given such notice, the borough shall remove the encroachment and the person encroaching shall be fined pursuant to KPB 14.40.380 and pay all costs incurred by the borough related to removal of the encroachment. However, the borough may immediately remove any unauthorized encroachment that impedes traffic or maintenance, or which causes a public safety hazard, with no notice to the owner at the discretion of the RSA director. 
F.  All encroachments, including those that pre-date the effective date of this ordinance, must apply for an encroachment permit. Permits for encroachments that existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall pay the same permit fee as applies to permits received prior to placement or construction of the encroachment. 
G.  Any encroachment without a permit may be removed in accordance with KPB 14.40.115(E) or may be granted a permit allowing such encroachment to remain if such encroachment meets the approval of the RSA director or designee. 
H.  The RSA director has discretion to grant or deny any encroachment permit. The following standards shall be considered for all encroachment permit applications: 
1.  The encroachment may not interfere with road maintenance. 
2.  The encroachment may not block access to normal travel along the right-of-way. 
3.  The encroachment may not interfere with sight lines or distance. 
4.  The encroachment may not create a safety hazard. 
5.  The encroachment may not be a permanent structure, meaning any structure of a permanent nature that requires footings, foundations or pilings. 
I.  A person may not be denied a reasonable means of access to the their property solely by the requirements of this chapter. An encroachment permit shall not grant the permittee exclusive right to use the area encroached upon. 
J.  A permit for construction of an encroachment (not covered by KPB 14.40.060) shall have an expiration date at which time the installation or construction of the encroachment must be complete. The permittee shall file a written notice of completion with the RSA director within ten days after completion of construction. No work shall be performed after the expiration date unless an extension is approved. If an extension is not approved, the borough may require the removal of the encroachment in accordance with KPB 14.40.115(E). 
K.  Hold harmless. The permittee shall indemnify, defend, and hold and save the borough, its elected and appointed officers, agents and employees harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits, or liability of any nature, kind or character including costs, expenses, and attorneys fees. The permittee shall be responsible under this clause for any and all legal actions or claims of any character, sustained by any person, or property arising from permittee or permittee's agents' performance or failure to perform this permit in any way whatsoever. This defense and indemnification responsibility includes claims alleging acts or omissions of the borough or its agents, which are said to have contributed to the losses, failure, violations, or damages, except for acts or omissions solely attributable to the borough. 
L.  Any damages to a public right-of-way, dedication, easement or borough land which is caused by an encroachment, authorized or unauthorized, are subject to immediate repair by the borough, at the owner's expense. The borough may require the owner to repair the damage within a timeframe specified by the RSA director if notice is given to the owner. The owner shall be subject to a fine as set forth in KPB 14.40.380 and liable for all costs incurred by the borough from the repair, including overhead costs. 
M.  The RSA director may revoke an encroachment permit or require removal of a permitted encroachment if at any time the encroachment impacts borough duties such as road construction, improvements or maintenance, or otherwise impairs or impedes public safety or access to the right-of-way. Removal of an encroachment due to revocation of an encroachment permit shall comply with the requirements of KPB 14.40.115(E). Issuance of an encroachment permit does not create a property right in the continuing encroachment. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22 , § 1, 8-18-15) 
14.40.120. - Permit applications-Initial review-Decision.

The order may require that the person or entity immediately cease all activity within the right-of-way, even if previously permitted to conduct work, upon receiving notice of the order. Notice may be given in person, or via telephone, e-mail, or facsimile. 
2.  The person or entity may request an informal meeting with the RSA director to attempt to resolve the violation. The RSA director has discretion to engage in an informal review and may require remedial action, modify the terms of a permit, or establish new permit conditions at the informal meeting.

The chair will notify the parties regarding the members of the panel that will hear the enforcement proceeding. The hearing will be scheduled not less than 15 days from the date of the notice. For good cause the RSA chair may reschedule the date of the hearing. The notice will inform the respondent of the requirement to file a response to the enforcement notice pursuant to KPB 14.40.340(C). 
B.  Not less than seven (7) days before the hearing, the borough shall provide to the RSA panel and the respondent the RSA's complete file regarding the permit, violation, and enforcement or fines at issue, except for the redaction of confidential material. The file shall include at a minimum and as relevant to the subject of the hearing: the enforcement notice; any cease and desist order or revocation notice; any complaints concerning the violations alleged in the notice; all investigative reports regarding each alleged violation; and all correspondence to or from the borough regarding each allegation. 
C.  Not less than seven (7) days before the hearing the respondent shall provide to the RSA panel and the RSA director evidence relevant to the subject of the hearing and shall submit a written response ("answer") on a form provided by the road service area to the allegations. The respondent's answer shall include: 
1.  The full name, mailing and physical address and daytime telephone number of the respondent, and of the person's attorney, if any. 
2.  A statement that the person admits, denies, or has insufficient information to respond regarding each allegation in the enforcement notice. A statement of insufficient information has the effect of a denial. Any allegation that is not denied shall be deemed admitted. 
3.  Signature of the respondent. 
D.  Once the RSA director issues an enforcement notice, unless it is withdrawn, the RSA panel shall conduct an enforcement proceeding and follow all of the procedures set forth in KPB 14.40.340 regardless of whether the respondent submits an answer to the enforcement notice as required in KPB 14.40.340(C). 
E.  The RSA panel shall set the agenda for the hearing and may call witnesses and request additional evidence. The hearing shall be open to the public. Parties may appear at the hearing in person or through counsel. The RSA panel may permit telephonic participation in the hearing by parties, their counsel or witnesses. The RSA panel may continue the hearing if necessary to obtain additional evidence. An electronic recording shall be made of the hearing by the RSA. 
F.  At the hearing the parties may present evidence and testimony on their own behalf, call witnesses, and cross examine other parties' witnesses to the extent the RSA panel determines to be reasonably necessary to explore any matters which tend to contradict, modify, or explain testimony given on direct. All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. 
G.  Within 10 days after the hearing, the RSA panel shall issue a written decision on all matters at issue at the hearing. The RSA chair shall distribute the decision to each party by personal delivery, certified mail, or by facsimile or email to a party who has consented to service by facsimile or email. The decision shall include a concise disposition statement either prescribing the fine imposed and the remedy for each violation, dismissing the enforcement notice, or declaring such other specific relief ordered by the RSA panel within the RSA board's jurisdiction as defined by KPB 14.40.320. A decision shall also identify the violator or violators to whom the remedy applies and indicate that it is appealable and set forth the method and timing for such appeal. The remedies may include: 
1.  An order to a violator to correct or abate the violation within a specified time. 
2.  An order to a violator to pay to the borough a fine pursuant to KPB 14.40.380. The fine shall not exceed $500 for each day of each such violation. Fines shall accrue from the date the enforcement notice is issued to the date the enforcement is initially set for hearing. Accumulated fines for each violation may not be reduced by the RSA panel to less than the equivalent of one day's fine. The RSA panel may suspend a portion of a fine for a violation as a condition of compliance with other portions of the decision. If a suspension of fine is ordered the respondent must pay not less than the equivalent of a one day fine. The fine shall be paid at the borough administrative building or the borough RSA building. Upon receiving notice that the fine has been paid, the RSA director shall inform the RSA chair that the respondent has complied with the order. 
3.  An order revoking a permit issued pursuant to this title. 
H.  In the case of an order under subsection KPB 14.40.340(G)(1), the RSA board retains jurisdiction of the matter, unless appealed, and the RSA director may apply to the RSA board for additional relief to enforce compliance with the order. Such an application is not exclusive of any other remedy that is available to the borough under this chapter or at law or in equity. 
I.  Violation of an enforcement order requiring actions set forth in KPB 14.40.340(G)(1) is a separate violation of this chapter. 
J.  Unpaid fines are collectible through filing an action in the trial courts of the State of Alaska and may include a judgment for fines, costs, and attorneys fees. Fines for charges appealed to the superior court are subject to collection unless the appellant receives a stay pending appeal from the court. Arrangements for payment plans may be made by the RSA director if the RSA director determines it is in the borough's best interest. 
K.  The RSA director or designee who issued the enforcement notice may dismiss the enforcement notice before the hearing by written notice to the RSA chair and each person entitled to service of the underlying notice, if the RSA director or designee finds: 
1.  The enforcement notice was issued in error; or 
2.  All violations that were alleged in the enforcement notice have been corrected or abated, and the borough does not seek any further remedies or penalties under the notice.

A purchase agreement, lease, or permit is subject to cancellation in whole or in part if improperly issued through error in procedure or with respect to material facts. 
E.  Conditional Contract. The borough may conditionally lease or issue permits for land it selects under the various state land grants and lands it reasonably believes it will own or will acquire title to prior to the actual receipt of title.

Payment made by the lessee or permittee on the land to which title is denied the borough shall be refunded in whole or in part to the agreement holder of record and any properly recorded lienholder, if any, jointly. However, the borough shall in no way be liable for any damage that may be done to the land by the lessee or permittee or liable for any claim of any third party, or to any claim that may arise from ownership. In the event the borough does receive title to the land under agreement, the conditional agreement shall then have the same standing, force and effect as non-conditional agreements issued under any regulations of this chapter.

In the event that the purchase agreement or lease is terminated, canceled or forfeited, or in the event that the demised lands, or any part thereof, should be abandoned by the purchaser during the agreement term, the borough or its agents, servants or representative, may immediately or any time thereafter, enter or re-enter and resume possession of said lands or such part thereof, and remove all persons and property therefrom either by summary proceedings or by a suitable action or proceeding at law or equity without being liable for any damages therefor.

However, either party may designate in writing such other address to which such notice of demand shall thereafter be so given, made or mailed. A notice given hereunder shall be deemed received when deposited in a U.S. general or branch post office by the addressor, and in like manner a notice from the borough to a vendee shall be deemed received by the vendee when such notice arrives at the general or branch post office from which final delivery to the said purchaser, lessee or permittee would normally be accomplished. 
K.  Notice of Default. Notice of the default will be in writing as provided in subsection I. of this section. A copy of the notice will be forwarded to all lienholders or others who have properly recorded their interest in the purchase, lease or permit agreement with the borough.

2.  If any improvements and/or chattels having an appraised value in excess of ten thousand dollars, as determined by a qualified appraiser, are not removed within the time allowed, such improvements and/or chattels shall, upon due notice to the purchaser, lessee, or permittee under the terminated or canceled contract, be sold at public sale under the direction of the mayor and in accordance with the provisions of KPB Chapter 5. The proceeds of the sale shall inure to the former purchaser, lessee, or permittee who placed such improvements and/or chattels on the lands, or his successors in interest, after paying to the borough all moneys due and owing and expenses incurred in making such a sale. In case there are no other bidders at any such sale, the mayor is authorized to bid, in the name of the borough, on such improvements and/or chattels. The bid money shall be taken from the fund to which said lands belong, and the fund shall receive all moneys or other value subsequently derived from the sale of leasing of such improvements and/or chattels. The borough shall acquire all the rights, both legal and equitable, that any other purchaser could acquire by reason of the purchase. 
3.  If any improvements and/or chattels having an appraised value of ten thousand dollars or less, as determined by the mayor, are not removed within the time allowed, such improvements and/or chattels shall revert and absolute title shall vest in the borough.

M.  Rental for Improvements or Chattels not Removed. Any improvements and/or chattels belonging to the purchaser, lessee, or permittee or placed on the land during his tenure with or without his permission and remaining upon the premises after the termination of the contract shall entitle the borough to charge a reasonable rent therefor. 
N.  Resale. In the event that a purchase or lease agreement should be terminated, canceled, forfeited or abandoned, the borough may offer said lands for sale, lease or other appropriate disposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or other applicable regulations. If said land is not immediately disposed of then said land shall return to the Land Bank.

In the event of cancellation or forfeiture of a lease or sale agreement for cause, the holder of a properly recorded mortgage, conditional assignment, or collateral assignment will have the option to acquire the lease or sale agreement for the unexpired term thereof, subject to the same terms and conditions as in the original instrument. Any party acquiring an agricultural purchase or lease agreement must meet the same requirements as the original purchaser or lessee. 
Q.  Rights-of-way. All trails or roads in existence at the time the land is sold may be considered to be an easement for public use. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the mayor or land management officer when applicable from specifically reserving such additional easements and rights-of-way across borough lands as deemed reasonable and necessary prior to the sale thereof. 
R.  Sale Documents. All sales of borough lands shall be on approved borough forms suitable for recording and may consist of a warranty deed, deed of trust, agreement to purchase, promissory note and any other required documents. 
S.  Sanitation. The purchaser, lessee, or permittee shall comply with all regulations or ordinances which a proper public authority in its discretion shall promulgate for the promotion of sanitation.

Violation of any provision of this chapter or of the terms of the agreement of sale, lease or permit may expose the purchaser, lessee, or permittee to appropriate legal action including forfeiture of purchase interest, termination, or cancellation of his interest in accordance with state law. 
W.  Written Waiver. The receipt of payment by the borough, regardless of knowledge of any breach of the purchase agreement by the purchaser, lessee or permittee, or of any default on the part of the purchaser, lessee or permittee in observance or performance of any of the conditions or covenants of the agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any provision of the agreement. Failure of the borough to enforce any covenant or provision therein contained shall not discharge or invalidate such covenants or provision or affect the right of the borough to enforce the same in the event of any subsequent breach or default. The receipt by the borough of any payment of any other sum of money after notice of termination or after the termination of the agreement for any reason, shall not reinstate, continue or extend the agreement, nor shall it destroy or in any manner impair the efficacy of any such notice of termination unless the sole reason for the notice was nonpayment of money due and payment fully satisfies the breach.

Such initial evaluation shall identify whether the project satisfies the following minimum requirements for direct borough support under this chapter: 
1.  The project must provide "economic development" as defined in this chapter; 
2.  The project must be supported by a "bank-ready business plan" as defined in this chapter; 
3.  The project must be situated in the area of the borough outside of the cities; and 
4.  The business plan must demonstrate that the proposed borough participation in the project as planned will 
a.  provide either a $10 million increase in the borough property tax base, or a minimum of 25 permanent full-time jobs in the area of the borough outside the cities; and 
b.  either reduce imports or increase exports from the borough; and 
c.  not take market share from existing businesses within the borough. 
5.  The project will meet the above criteria within a reasonable time period as defined by standard business practices. 
    The burden is on the project applicant throughout this process to demonstrate that the project, as proposed, satisfies the requirements of this chapter. 
    Projects satisfying all five of the above criteria shall be referred to the office of the borough mayor for evaluation, along with a written analysis prepared by the screening agency. Projects not satisfying all five of the above criteria shall not be eligible for direct borough support under this chapter, and may be referred to an agency other than the borough for assistance. 
(Ord. No. 99-14, § 1, 4-6-1999) 
19.30.050. - Evaluation by borough mayor. 
a.  Evaluation Committee: The mayor shall appoint, and the assembly confirm, a standing committee of ten persons from the private sector with business and technical expertise, from which three persons shall be selected and appointed by the mayor to evaluate each economic development project referred to the borough by the screening agency. The three persons shall assess the project's viability and submit a written report to the mayor including written findings, and recommending the level and form of direct borough support, if any. The office of the mayor shall provide administrative support for any such committee. 
b.  Fee: Prior to borough evaluation of a project under this paragraph, the applicant may be required to submit an application fee, as may be established by assembly resolution, to help defray administrative costs. 
c.  Procedure: Based upon the recommendations of this committee and such other information as the mayor considers appropriate, the mayor shall issue a written report recommending that the proposal either be considered by the assembly for direct borough support or that it not be presented to the assembly. This report shall be presented to the assembly within 60 days of the borough mayor's receipt of a referred proposal, and fee when applicable, or by such later date as may be authorized by the assembly by motion or resolution. An ordinance setting forth the proposed direct support shall be submitted for introduction simultaneously with the report, for projects recommended for direct support. 
d.  Projects not recommended for direct support: Projects not recommended for direct borough support may be referred back to the screening agency for further evaluation and possible referral to any appropriate external agency other than the borough. Any such project shall not be presented to the mayor's office for reconsideration for a minimum of six months after disapproval absent significant, substantial, and compelling changes to the proposal. 
(Ord. No. 99-14, § 1, 4-6-1999) 
19.30.060. - Forms of direct borough support. 
    Direct support from the borough for economic development projects may include the use or transfer of borough land, tax credits, and other forms of support as approved by the assembly. Assembly approval by ordinance is required for direct borough support of an economic development project. 
A.  Land. In determining whether to make borough land available for the project, and on what terms, the following criteria shall be considered: 
1.  Compatibility of the proposed use with the comprehensive plan and overall community needs. 
2.  Compatibility of the proposed use with adjacent and surrounding land uses. 
3.  Whether other borough land is available for the project in the nearby community. If not, whether there is adequate public land available to provide foreseeable public needs such as utilities, schools, emergency centers, solid waste disposal sites, and other foreseeable public needs. 
4.  Whether other private land is available that would be appropriate for the proposed use. If so, whether the proposed use would inappropriately compete with private land owners. 
5.  Examine the highest and best use of this parcel compared with the proposed use of the parcel. 
6.  Determine whether other parties are likely to be interested in the same parcel of land. If so, consider the best option available for the borough and the community. 
7.  The extent of any adverse impact the project may have on other borough resources or the natural environment. 
8.  Consider the effect of the proposal on both the land bank and the land trust fund. 
9.  The proposed terms of the transfer should be evaluated with all available options considered, including sale or lease at fair market value, sale or lease at less than fair market value, and favorable initial terms to help with startup financing to be repaid later. 
10.  Consider borough land costs associated with the proposal such as payment of surveying, platting, appraisal, and closing costs. 
B.  Tax Credits. Tax credits available for economic development projects shall include the economic development tax exemption to the extent the project qualifies for that exemption, and any other exemptions that are allowable under state statute and borough code. Applications made solely pursuant to the borough's economic development tax exemption at KPB 5.12.116 shall comply with the requirements for that exemption and are not subject to this chapter. 
C.  Other. The assembly may consider other forms of direct support of qualifying economic development projects, provided that direct monetary contributions, either in the form of loans or grants, to applicants for direct borough support for economic development purposes, shall not be available through this process. This shall not be construed to prohibit access to tax exempt financing for such purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2018-11 , § 3, 4-3-18; Ord. No. 99-14, § 1, 4-6-1999)

( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.25.110. - Approval-Scope-Expiration restriction. 
A.  Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat, but means only that the basic lot and street design is acceptable. The subdivider is on notice that it is the subdivider's responsibility to provide all the information required in this ordinance and to submit a correct final plat within two years of the date of the planning commission's conditional approval of the preliminary plat. Upon application by the subdivider prior to the two-year deadline for final plat submittal, a time extension for two years beyond the initial two-year period for submittal of the final plat may be granted by the planning director. A third and final two-year extension may be granted by the planning director when requested by the subdivider prior to expiration of the previous approval, allowing for a total approval time of six years. When the preliminary plat is located within city limits, submittal of documentation from the city advisory planning commission indicating concurrence with the time extension request must accompany a time extension request. When a preliminary plat that has been granted a time extension is finalized, the final plat must comply with the current code. Expiration of time extensions will require the submission of, and action on, a new preliminary plat. 
B.  Preliminary plats that will be finalized in phases must comply with current code at the time each phase is finalized. All dedications for streets that are required pursuant to KPB 20.30.030 must be provided in the first phase. The approval of a final plat for a portion of the phased preliminary shall extend the preliminary approval for two years for the remaining land within the phased subdivision, except that the commission may require a new preliminary plat if the abutting road system changes. Phases must be filed in sequential order. 
C.  Any plat that requires submittal to and approval by the State of Alaska, including but not limited to section line easement vacation plats and highway right-of-way plans, will be given an initial four year preliminary approval. Extensions of the approval may be given by the planning director as needed for completion of the project. 
D.  No more than one revision process to the same preliminary plat is allowed. Major revisions to a preliminary plat shall not be approved on the final plat without first being processed under the public notice and hearing requirements for preliminary plats. Major revisions at the time of final plat which increase density, add or substantively move rights-of-way, or otherwise increase the subdivision's impact, are not allowed and will require submittal of a new preliminary plat, application and fee.

The portion of a vacated street which lies within the limits of a platted addition attaches to the lots of the platted addition bordering on the area. If a public square is vacated, the title to it vests in the city if it lies within the city and to the borough if it lies within the borough outside a city. If the property vacated is a lot or tract, title vests in the rightful owner.

If the borough or city acquired the street or other public area vacated for legal consideration or by express dedication to and acceptance by the borough or city other than required subdivision platting, before the final act of vacation the fair market value of the street or public area shall be deposited with the platting authority to be paid over to the borough or city on final vacation. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.160. - Partial vacation allowed. 
    Where the planning commission finds that a right-of-way must be preserved, but determines there is excessive width for all intended uses within the right-of-way, the commission may approve a partial vacation of a right-of-way such that the width is reduced to the maximum necessary for the intended use. Such vacation shall conform to this title for the class of right-of-way involved except where the right-of-way is not intended to be used for vehicular purposes. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.170. - Vehicular access. 
    The planning commission shall not approve the vacation of a right-of-way unless an equal or superior right-of-way for vehicular access exists or will be provided in exchange. Where two or more access points are necessary for large vacant or semi-vacant areas of land, the commission shall consider density, use, projected development, and maintain sufficient rights-of-way to serve potential use. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.180. - Other access. 
    Other lawful uses that exist or are feasible for the right-of-way shall be considered when evaluating a vacation request. When such uses exist or could exist within rights-of-way which are not suited for general road use, the commission shall not approve the vacation request, unless it can be demonstrated that equal or superior access is or will be available. The planning commission shall consider whether alternate uses present public safety issues which support approval of the vacation. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.190. - Utility provisions. 
    All existing and future utility requirements shall be considered when evaluating a vacation request. Rights-of-way which are utilized by a public utility or which logically would be required by a public utility shall not be vacated, unless it can be demonstrated that equal or superior access is or will be available. Where an easement would satisfactorily serve the utility interests, and no other public need for the right-of-way exists, the commission may approve the vacation and require that a public utility easement be granted in place of the right-of-way. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.200. - Waterfront access provisions. 
    A right-of-way which serves to provide access to public waters shall not be vacated unless such a right-of-way is wholly impractical to all modes of transport including pedestrian or the use of such right-of-way causes damage to the right-of-way, adjacent properties, the waterbody or the watercourse, or threatens public safety which cannot otherwise be corrected and where such continued damage or threat would be contrary to the public interest. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.210. - Other public areas. 
    Dedications of land for use other than rights-of-way, which are considered for vacation, shall be approved only when it is in the public interest. The commission shall consider the intended purpose of the area, and any future uses of the area when making a decision. When a legitimate public purpose is or would be served by use of the area proposed for vacation, the commission shall not approve the vacation, unless the ownership of the land by the city or borough in a form other than dedicated would adequately serve the intended use. 
( Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 2-11-14 ) 
20.70.220. - Section line easement vacations. 
    Section line easement vacation petitions must comply with the requirements of KPB 20.70.040, 20.70.050 and 20.70.060. A fee is required in compliance with KPB 20.70.060.

Publication on the planning commission agenda, advertised once in local papers, posted in public areas and on the borough website prior to the meeting will satisfy the publishing requirements. The petitioner is responsible for all submittals required by the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in compliance with their procedures. The petition must be reviewed and approved by the planning commission but final authority for approval and platting of the vacation rests with DNR. The petitioner is responsible for coordination with DNR and submittals to DNR.

CHAPTER 21.04. - ZONING DISTRICTS 

21.04.010. - Designated-Area included-Scope of regulations. 
    The Kenai Peninsula Borough is divided into 2 zoning districts: 
A.  The municipal district; and 
B.  The rural district. The municipal district includes all of the area within cities which have exercised zoning power through the adoption of a municipal ordinance. The rural district includes the rest of the area of the borough. Regulation of land use within the municipal district shall be governed by the applicable municipal ordinances, regulations and restrictions as amended to December 31, 1965. Land use in the rural district shall be unrestricted except as otherwise provided in this title. 
(Ord. No. 15, § 1(part), 1966; KPC § 20.10.10) 
21.04.020. - Notification of proposed zoning district creation or change and hearing. 
A.  When a public hearing is to be held by the Assembly concerning the creation, amendment, or abolishment of a zoning district other than the rural district, a notice containing the following information shall be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the subject zoning district during each of the 2 calendar weeks prior to the public hearing date. Additionally a copy of the notice shall be mailed to all real property owners of record on the borough assessor's records of property located in the specific district proposed to be created, amended, or abolished. If the subject district is an overlay district this notice by mail requirement shall not apply to owners of property in other districts that is not located in the subject overlay district. 
B.  Where an amendment to an existing zoning district involves only increasing or decreasing the size of the district the administration is only required to mail the notice set forth in KPB 21.04.020(A) to the owners of record of parcels with a changed status. 
C.  The notice shall contain at least the following information:

CHAPTER 21.05. - PROCEDURES FOR VARIANCE FROM TITLE 21 

21.05.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to grant relief from the literal application of this title where unusual individualized situations result in more stringent burdens being placed on some parcels of land than others and to prevent special hardships to individual landowners or deprivation of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in a district. 
(Ord. No. 2001-32, § 1, 10-23-01; Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.020. - Burden of proof. 
    The situations justifying variances are rare and the burden of proof that an application meets the standards of this ordinance is on the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.030. - Application-Public hearing. 
A.  An application for a variance shall be made on a form provided by the planning department and shall contain: 
1.  The legal description of the parcel for which the variance is requested; 
2.  A statement of the facts justifying the variance; and 
3.  The applicant's certification that: 
a.  The variance is not being sought by the person causing the conditions requiring the variance, 
b.  That the variance will not permit a land use in a district where the use is prohibited, and 
c.  That the variance is not sought solely to relieve pecuniary hardship or inconvenience. 
B.  The planning department may require additional information from the applicant helpful to the variance determination, including but not limited to, an as-built or certificate from a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer when necessary to the determination. 
C.  The planning department shall process the variance application within 45 days of receipt, place it on the planning commission agenda, and make recommendations to the planning commission regarding approval, denial, and conditions, if any, to be placed on the variance. 
D.  A public hearing shall be held before the planning commission regarding all variance applications. The public hearing notice requirements set forth in KPB 21.11 shall be followed. Variances within local option zoning districts require notice to all property owners within the district. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.040. - Standards. 
A.  Pursuant to AS 29.40.040(b) a variance from a land use regulation adopted under KPB Title 21 may not be granted if: 
1.  Special conditions that require the variance are caused by the person seeking the variance; 
2.  The variance will permit a land use in a district in which that use is prohibited; or 
3.  The variance is solely to relieve pecuniary hardship or inconvenience. 
B.  The planning commission shall also consider the following standards: 
1.  Whether a lesser variance than that applied for would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as surrounding property owners; 
2.  Whether a lesser variance than that applied for would give substantial relief to the owner of the property involved and be more consistent with justice to the surrounding property owners; 
3.  Whether relief can be granted in such a fashion that the spirit of the ordinance will be observed and public health, safety, and welfare secured; and 
4.  Whether the authorization of a variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to nearby property; 
C.  Consistent with the public health, safety, and welfare, the planning commission may attach conditions to an authorized variance regarding location, character, and other features of the proposed structures or uses as it finds necessary to carry out the spirit and purposes of this ordinance and the ordinance from which the variance is requested. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.050. - Variances-Expiration-Extension. 
    If the variance allowed requires further action of the property owner to be effective, and such action is not taken within two years of granting the variance, the variance shall expire. The planning department may prepare and record an expiration document; however, failure to prepare or record an expiration document does not extend the length of variance authorization. The planning commission may extend the period of variance authorization without a public hearing upon a finding that there has been no basic change in pertinent conditions surrounding the property at the time of original approval as long as the request for extension is submitted before the two-year period of authorization expires. If the period of authorization expires without an extension application being filed with the planning department the applicant must again file an original application for variance. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.060. - Findings of fact. 
    A written decision in resolution form shall be rendered by the planning commission granting, denying, or modifying the variance application with findings of fact based on the substantial evidence in the record. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.070. - Recordation. 
    Variances, extensions, and expirations may be recorded in the state of Alaska recording district in which the affected parcel is located. A processing fee in the amount listed in the most current Kenai Peninsula Borough Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees not to exceed the administrative costs of preparing and recording the variance document may be charged as a condition of a variance or variance extension. If the processing fee is charged the borough shall be responsible for the recording. Failure to record a variance, expiration, or extension will not affect its validity. 
(Ord. No. 2011-32, § 27, 9-20-11; Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.080. - Appeal. 
    Pursuant to AS 29.40.050 an appeal may be taken from the grant or denial of a variance pursuant to the provisions of KPB 21.20 by the applicant, a government entity, or an aggrieved party. An "aggrieved party" means a party adversely impacted by the decision and who has participated in a particular variance determination at the planning commission level either by filing written comments or in person. 
(Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
21.05.090. - Exemptions. 
    Chapters within Title 21 which set forth variance provisions, unless otherwise provided in such chapters, are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 98-50, § 2, 10-13-98; Ord. No. 97-52, § 1(part), 1997) 
CHAPTER 21.06. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 

21.06.010. - Findings and statement. 
    The assembly adopts the following findings and statements establishing a floodplain management chapter: 
A.  Findings. The flood hazard areas of Kenai Peninsula Borough are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
7.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
C.  Objectives. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
1.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 88-7, § 2(part), 1988) 
21.06.020. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2013-29, § 3, adopted August 6, 2013, amended the Code by repealing former § 21.06.020 in its entirety. Former § 21.06.020 pertained to definitions, and derived from Ord. No. 88-7 of 1988, and Ord. No. 2009-09(S), adopted March 24, 2009. Similar provisions can be found in § 21.06.070. 
21.06.030. - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the Kenai Peninsula Borough exclusive of the cities of Homer, Kenai, Seward, and Soldotna. 
B.  Basis for Establishing Flood Hazard Areas. Flood hazard areas are identified as follows: 
1.  By the areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in the scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study" (FIS) for the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska dated May 19, 1981, revised on July 5, 1983, December 6, 1999, and September 27, 2013. These areas are depicted on the effective flood FIRM and DFIRM Panels. The map panels numbered 020012-1350 and 1700 have been deleted and the areas depicted by these panels are not subject to the terms of this chapter. Excluding these panels, the flood insurance rate maps are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance rate maps are on file at the planning department. The best available information for flood hazard as outlined in KPB 21.06.040(C)(3) shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM or DFIRM is issued which incorporates the base flood plain data obtained pursuant to that section. 
2.  The 1986, 1995, and 2006 KPB GIS mapped flood data area within the Seward-Bear Creek Flood Service Area (SMFDA) outside the city limits of Seward, not including any Special Flood Hazard Area identified in a current, effective FIRM or DFIRM. A map showing this floodplain and flood data and a list of properties represented by this map shall be retained by the planning department and made available to the public. If any portion of a lot is included in the flood data mapped area, the entire lot shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. Special provisions for development permits in the KPB mapped flood data area are set forth in KPB 21.06.045. Data available from other federal, state of other sources shall be reviewed and reasonably utilized including but not limited to the following: 
a.  "Flood of October 1986 at Seward Alaska," USGS Water-Resources Investigation Report 87-4278. Jones, S.H., and Zenone, Chester. (1988). 
b.  "Hydrologic Reconnaissance near Fourth of July Creek, Seward, Alaska." USGS Water Resources Investigations 81-21. Nelson, G.L. (1981). 
C.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Kenai Peninsula Borough, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
D.  Noncompliance-Enforcement. Structures and activities which are not permitted or allowed by this chapter are prohibited. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be enforced by the remedies set forth in KPB 21.50. Each day a violation continues is a separate violation.

21.06.045. - KPB GIS mapped flood data area. 
A.  Base flood elevation in the SMFDA district. Based upon a digital elevation model provided by the borough, base flood elevation in the SMFDA district, which does not include any area of the Special Flood Hazard Area represented in an effective FIRM or DFIRM, is established by a professional land surveyor licensed in the State of Alaska or professional engineer licensed in the State of Alaska at the highest point within the lot measured downslope from the specific construction site. 
B.  Exemption from application of SMFDA district. 
1.  A property owner may request an exemption for application of SMFDA, which does not include any area of the Special Flood Hazard Area represented in an effective FIRM or DFIRM, to his proposed development upon a showing by substantial evidence that his property was not inundated by flood waters in the 1986, 1995, or 2006 floods; adverse bank erosion has not occurred during the property owner's ownership, erosion cannot be determined by analysis of KPB aerial photos beginning in 1986; the property is not a Corps of Engineers regulated wetland; or adjacent property owners concur there has been no adverse impact to their properties by flooding from the property of ownership making the request for SMFDA exemption. Staff shall verify whether the application for exemption meets the criteria and shall issue a written determination regarding the same. This determination may be appealed to the planning commission within 15 days of issuance. 
2.  Where elevation and conveyance data is not available, applications for development permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed development will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes the use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, best management practices, and other available reasonably reliable data. 
C.  Conditions. Only primary structures, substantial improvements to primary structures, and development in the minimum flood corridor in the SMFDA district require a development permit. The permits in the SMFDA district are subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Primary structures, including the crawl space, basement, or any part of the structure other than the supports, in the SMFDA district, which does not include any area of the Special Flood Hazard Area represented in an effective FIRM or DFIRM, shall be a minimum of two feet above base flood elevation; 
2.  Foundations shall have an erosion resistant design; and 
3.  Where applicable, including for attached garages and similar construction, the standards for the permit is subject to the standards set forth in KPB 21.06.050; and 
4.  The permitted activity shall not increase the risk of flood damage to downstream or adjacent properties. 
D.  Currently active channels within the SMFDA district. All development in the SMFDA district in the minimum flood corridor within the Resurrection River watershed, Spruce and Sawmill Creeks, shall require a permit that is based on best management practices to minimize adverse impacts to properties in the vicinity of the subject activity. 
E.  If review of the permit application by staff indicates that the conditions set forth in KPB 21.06.045(C) cannot be met, staff shall deny the application. The applicant may apply for a permit from the planning commission by submitting a project-specific design under the waiver provisions of KPB 21.06.045(F). 
F.  Exceptions. The exception procedure in KPB 21.06.060 only applies to permitting in Special Flood Hazard Area of the current effective FIRM or DFIRM area. For the SMFDA area, a project-specific design prepared by a licensed professional engineer may be submitted for consideration to the planning commission in lieu of meeting the conditions set forth in KPB 21.06.045(C). Based upon written findings of fact, the planning commission may grant or deny the permit and place conditions on the permit it grants in order that the risk of flood damage to downstream or adjacent property or flood damage to public infrastructure will not be increased. The grant or denial of a permit may be appealed to the hearing officer within 15 days of distribution of the planning commission's written decision.

d.  Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals which contain 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is less. The floodplain requirements for subdivision plats, detailed in KPB 20.30.280, apply to all subdivision proposals. 
e.  It is the responsibility of the subdivider to provide all necessary information regarding flood protection measures at the time the preliminary plat is presented for consideration by the planning commission. 
5.  Review of Development Permits. Where elevation data is not available, applications for development permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. 
B.  Specific Standards. In all flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in KPB 21.06.030(B), the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two openings located on separate walls and having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed space subject to flooding shall be provided. 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade. 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
iv.  Enclosed areas below the base flood elevation must be unfinished and usable only for parking, access or storage of materials easily moved during a flood event. 
v.  Before a final floodplain development permit is issued by the planning department for a residential structure with enclosed areas below the base flood elevation, the owners shall sign a non-conversion agreement stating that the enclosed space shall remain in compliance with KPB 21.06.050(B)(1)(b)(iv). The non-conversion agreement shall be recorded by the Kenai Peninsula Borough placing future buyers of properties on notice of the hazards of enclosed spaces below the base flood elevation and the requirements to keep the permitted structure compliant with KPB floodplain regulations. 
c.  For zones AH and AO, drainage paths are required around structures on slopes to drain floodwaters away from proposed structures. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in KPB 21.06.040(C)(4)(b). 
d.  Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standard for space below the lowest floor as described in KPB 21.06.050(B)(1)(b). 
e.  Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are 1 foot below the floodproofed level (e.g. a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level). 
f.  For zones AH and AO, drainage paths are required around structures on slopes to drain floodwaters away from proposed structures. 
3.  Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of subsection (A)(1) of this section. 
4.  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles that are placed on sites within a Special Flood Hazard Area as identified by the current effective FIRM or DFIRM panel are required to either: 
a.  Meet the requirements of chapter 21.06.050(A) and (B), or 
b.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or 
c.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, and attached to the site only by a quick disconnect type utilities and security devices. 
5.  Before regulatory floodway. In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Special Flood Hazard Area zones AE, A1-A30 as identified in the current effective FIRM or DFIRM panel at that location unless the applicant demonstrates in the application that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
6.  Fuel storage tanks. Any fuel storage tanks shall be elevated above the base flood elevation or made watertight and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The tank must also be installed within an impervious containment basin of a size sufficient to contain 110 percent of storage capacity plus 12 inches of freeboard. 
7.  Logging or clearing. Within any special flood hazard area of the current effective FIRM or DFIRM, logging or clearing may not increase runoff and/or erosion to such levels that it may significantly damage the floodplain function, riparian habitat or wetlands. 
C.  Floodways. Located within flood hazard areas established in KPB 21.06.030(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to erosion potential and the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, the following provisions apply: 
1.  All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If subdivision (1) of this subsection is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
D.  Coastal High Hazard Areas. Where FEMA has identified coastal high hazard areas (Zones V, VE, and V1-V30) on the FIRM or DFIRM, construction shall meet the following requirements in addition to all other provisions in this chapter: 
1.  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide and shall be anchored to prevent unintended lateral movement, floatation or collapse. 
2.  All new construction, manufactured homes, and substantial improvements within coastal high hazard areas shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns such that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; and 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year or 1-percent annual exceedence probability mean recurrence interval); and 
c.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall provide a certification that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subdivisions (2)(a) and (2)(b) of this subsection. The certification and related records will be maintained in the planning department permit files in perpetuity. 
3.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and must be in compliance with the residential construction standards in KPB 21.06.050(B)(1)(b)(iv) and (v). For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
b.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year or 1-percent annual exceedence probability mean recurrence interval). 
4.  The use of fill for structural support of buildings within coastal high hazard areas on the FIRM or DFIRM is prohibited. 
5.  Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within coastal high hazard areas shall meet the requirements for new and substantial improvement construction.

21.06.055. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2013-29 , § 8, adopted August 6, 2013, amended the Code by repealing former § 21.06.055 in its entirety. Former § 21.06.055 pertained to restrictions within floodplains for habitat protection, required permits, fuel storage tanks and logging, and conditions, and derived from Ord. No. 2010-12, adopted April 6, 2010. 
21.06.060. - Exceptions procedure. 
A.  Appeal Board. 
1.  The Kenai Peninsula Borough Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals and requests for exceptions from the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the planning department in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
3.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the hearing officer in accordance with the provisions of AS 29.40.050 and KPB 21.20. 
4.  In passing upon such applications, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other section of this chapter, and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
5.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (A)(4) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of exceptions as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter, 
6.  The planning department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any exceptions to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
B.  Conditions for Exceptions. 
1.  Generally, the only condition under which an exception from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subparagraphs (a) through (k) of subsection (A)(4) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the exception increases. 
2.  Exceptions may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section. 
3.  Exceptions shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Exceptions shall only be issued upon a determination that the exception is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Exceptions shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the exception would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a exception will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Exceptions, or variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, or to economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, exceptions from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
7.  Exceptions may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-flood proofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other exception criteria except subsection (B)(1) of this section, and otherwise complies with KPB 21.06.060(A) and (B). 
8.  Any applicant to whom a exception is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

CHAPTER 21.18. - ANADROMOUS WATERS HABITAT PROTECTION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2000-08, § 1, adopted May 16, 2000, amended the title of Ch. 21.18. Subsequently Ord. No. 2013-18, § 1, adopted July 2, 2013, amended the title of Ch. 21.18. 

21.18.010. - Findings. 
A.  In enacting this ordinance the assembly finds numerous factors affect the habitat of the anadromous waters within the Kenai Peninsula Borough. These include removal of near shore native vegetation, bank erosion, bank trampling, pollution, inadequate tourism infrastructure, unsuccessful attempts to remedy bank erosion or protect and restore habitat, inconsistent regulations and enforcement, logging, grazing, mining, wetland fill and drainage, excavation and fill of property, dredging, inappropriately installed culverts, fuel storage, and maintenance of existing structures. 
B.  The assembly finds that fuel storage and significant removal of vegetation within the 100-year floodplain along the anadromous waters require regulation to protect the salmon habitat. 
C.  The assembly finds that the uncontrolled use and pollution of shoreland and riparian areas adversely affects the prosperity of the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare, and impairs the tax base. 
D.  The assembly finds that the legislature of Alaska authorizes the borough to provide for planning, platting, and land use regulation. AS 29.40.010, Planning, platting, and land use regulation, states in subsection (a) that "[a] first or second class borough shall provide for planning, platting, and land use regulation on an areawide basis." 
E.  The assembly finds that the riparian ecosystem includes stream bank and floodplain areas and recognizes that impacts to anadromous waters may be due to activities and uses within the greater watershed. 
F.  The assembly finds that the 1997 update of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources Kenai River comprehensive management plan recognized the increased use of the Kenai River resource and its associated impacts and recognized the deterioration of nearshore habitat for juvenile salmon and stated in section 2.2 that "[t]he importance of riparian (stream bank) vegetation to fish and wildlife values cannot be overestimated." 
G.  The assembly finds that it is in the public interest to further public knowledge of, and the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect anadromous fish spawning grounds, rearing waters, and migration corridors and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures, and land uses; and to preserve native shore cover and natural beauty. These responsibilities are hereby recognized by the Kenai Peninsula Borough.

21.18.065. - Activities not requiring a permit. 
A.  The permit required by this chapter is not required for noncommercial recreational and other non-intrusive activities which do not involve construction, excavation, or fill of land and do not result in significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to the riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems. 
Natural vegetation on land abutting lakes and streams protects scenic beauty, controls erosion, provides fish and wildlife habitat, moderates temperature, stabilizes the banks, and reduces the flow of effluents and nutrients from the shoreland into the water. Vegetation removal and land disturbing activities within the habitat protection district are prohibited, with the following exceptions which do not require a permit: 
1.  Routine maintenance of existing legally established landscaping and landscape features developed prior to regulation by KPB 21.18, in the habitat protection district, may be continued without a permit. To be considered routine maintenance, activities must have been consistently carried out so that lawns or ornamental plants predominate over native or invasive species. Maintenance is performed with hand tools or light equipment only. Tree removal is not included. "Routine maintenance" activities include mowing; pruning; weeding; planting annuals, perennials, fruits and vegetables; and other activities associated with an ornamental landscape. 
2.  Pruning of trees and woody shrubs for the health and/or renewal of vegetation shall not result in removal of more than 25% of the living crown of a tree, nor jeopardize the health and natural shape of a tree or shrub. 
3.  The removal of trees downed by force of nature. 
4.  The planting of native vegetation does not require a permit provided runoff and erosion are controlled and do not enter the water body.

21.18.071. - Staff permits. 
A.  An application for a permit shall be made and a permit issued before commencement of certain activities, uses, and structures set forth in this section if they do not result in significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to the riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems. An application for a permit shall be made to the Kenai Peninsula Borough planning department central office or at the river center. Upon determination that the submitted information of record supporting the permit application meets the requirements of this section, staff shall issue a permit for the following activities, uses, and structures in the habitat protection district: 
1.  Tree Management 
a.  A tree, or portion thereof, may be removed for one or more of the following reasons: 
(i)  The tree, or portion thereof, is dead. 
(ii)  The tree is a safety hazard to persons or property. 
(iii)  The tree removal is for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease to other trees. 
Whenever a tree is removed, it shall be replaced with two seedlings less than 5.5 feet tall of a species native to the region. 
2.  Elevated light penetrating structures. These structures include structures that are not ancillary to another use but are constructed solely for purposes of accessing the river and may include but are not limited to boardwalks, gratewalks, stairs, ramps, platforms, and gangplanks. Elevated light penetrating structures must be constructed of wood, plastic, fiberglass, aluminum, steel, or other nontoxic material. If the wood is treated, it must be certified as nontoxic to plants and animals by an independent laboratory or other appropriate agency. The topography of the bank and habitat protection district may not be altered to provide for the installation of these structures. 
a.  Elevated light penetrating structures with less than 60 percent but a minimum of 25 percent light penetration must not exceed six feet in width and must be constructed so that no part, other than the supporting posts, are less than 18 inches from the ground. 
b.  Elevated light penetrating structures with at least 60 percent light penetration must not exceed eight feet in width and must be constructed so that no part, other than the supporting posts, is closer than four inches from the ground. To ensure safety or to aid access, one side or edge of the elevated light penetrating structure may be lowered, provided that the frame on the riverward edge of the structure, is not less than four inches from the ground. Lowering of the surface shall not result in erosion or damage to the bank or vegetation, and the remainder of the structure must still meet the requirements of this chapter. 
c.  For elevated light penetrating structures under KPB 21.18.071(a) and (b), the total length of all elevated light penetrating structures that run along or parallel to the banks of the waters shall be limited in length to no more than one-third of the total lineal water frontage of the parcel on which it is constructed. 
d.  For all elevated light penetrating structures under KPB 21.18.071(a) and (b), the open space must be uniformly distributed throughout the structure surface. 
e.  Elevated light penetrating structures constructed prior to the effective date of this section may be brought into compliance with the standards of this section without obtaining a permit. 
3.  A single fish-cleaning station may be constructed, provided it has no enclosed sides or roof and that any shelf below the fish-cleaning surface must be at least 60 percent light penetrating and be elevated at least eight inches from the ground. Fish-cleaning stations shall not exceed 25 square feet, excluding the chute and drain pipes, if any. 
4.  Bank restoration and protection projects. 
5.  Within the habitat protection district adjacent to a lake, impervious coverage is allowed up to 10% of the habitat protection district, not to exceed a total of 500 square feet, provided that within 10' of the shoreline, no more than 25% of native vegetation is removed. 
Allowable uses include structures for temporary use such as gazebos, barbecues, walkways, fire pits, decks and saunas. 
Mitigation measures shall be provided to help offset the loss of vegetation. Mitigation measures include, but are not limited to, reserving uplands for native vegetation, or other measures which compensate by reserving equivalent footage of riparian area vegetation. 
B.  Applicants for a permit issued pursuant to this chapter are responsible for abiding by all other federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and permitting requirements applicable to the project. 
( Ord. No. 2013-18, § 9, 7-2-13 ; Ord. No. 2012-37, § 5, 10-9-12; Ord. No. 2010-14, § 3, 4-6-10) 
21.18.072. - Limited commercial activity within habitat protection area. 
    The planning commission may issue a permit for activities to be conducted within or using the habitat protection area as provided in this section. Permits are required for commercial activities of the same nature as those allowed under KPB 21.18.065 for private non-commercial use upon conditions that the activity is limited to pedestrian use over boardwalks, stair and docks necessary to alleviate the increased levels of activity attendant to the commercial activity. A permit may not be issued unless the planning commission determines the activity will be conducted in a manner that does not result in significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems. In granting a permit, the planning commission may establish such conditions on the development, use or operation of the activity or facility for which the conditional use permit is granted as it determines necessary to prevent significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems. The activity must be conducted on a portion of property adjacent to the property within the habitat protection area for which the permit is sought.

3.  The development of the use or structure shall not physically damage the adjoining property; 
4.  The proposed use or structure is water-dependent. 
5.  Applicant or owner's compliance with other borough permits and ordinance requirements. 
E.  Conditions attached to conditional uses and structures. In granting a conditional use permit, the planning commission may establish such conditions on the development, use, or operation of the use or structure for which the conditional use permit is granted as it determines necessary to prevent significant erosion, sedimentation, damage within the habitat protection district, or result in or increase ground or surface water pollution. Such conditions may include specifications for type of vegetative shore cover, location of structures and uses, periods of operation, type of construction, and mitigation. Violation of any of these conditions shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance. To secure information upon which to base its determination, the planning commission may require the applicant to furnish the following information: 
1.  A plan of the area showing surface contours, ordinary high water or mean high water marks, vegetative cover, slope measurements, soil conditions, wetlands, and drainages; 
2.  Location of buildings, parking areas, access, walkways, and other manmade features on the landscape; 
3.  Other pertinent information necessary to determine if the proposed use meets the requirements of this ordinance. 
F.  If the planning commission denies a conditional use permit, a similar application for a conditional use permit may not be made within two years from the date of the denial unless there has been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the application. 
G.  Applicants for a conditional use permit are responsible for abiding by all other federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and permitting requirements applicable to the project. 
H.  The construction or installation phase of a use requiring a conditional use permit must be completed within one calendar year from the date of the permit's issuance, or the conditional use permit shall expire unless the planning commission finds that more time is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, in which case the commission may extend the deadline for a maximum of six years from the date of issuance. The planning commission shall adopt findings consistent with the purposes of this chapter to support the issuance of a permit, or an extension thereof, totaling more than two years from the date of issuance. Prior to its expiration date, a conditional use permit issued for up to one year may be extended for up to twelve (12) months by the director of planning upon written request.

21.18.090. - Prior existing uses and structures. 
A.  Intent. There are uses which were conducted, and structures which were under construction, or exist and were in use before the enactment of this ordinance which would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this section to allow these prior existing uses or structures to continue but not be increased, expanded, or intensified. Any prior existing uses or structures must still comply with other applicable laws. 
B.  The burden of proof is on the applicant to show that a prior existing use or structure existed, when the use or structure was established, and the size, location, and level of use. 
C.  Structures. Structures which were under construction or in use before the effective date of any provision of this chapter, but that would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this chapter, shall be allowed to continue, provided that a structure under construction must have been substantially completed by April 16, 1998 for the anadromous waters set forth in KPB 21.18 Appendix Kenai River District, May 16, 2002, for the anadromous waters set forth in KPB 21.18 Appendix Major Waters District, January 1, 2014 for the anadromous waters set forth in KPB 21.18 Appendix West District, and January 1, 2016 for the anadromous waters set forth in KPB 21.18 Appendix South District and North District. 
1.  Upon application and approval of a prior-existing structure/use permit by planning department staff principal structures may be replaced, repaired or reconstructed within three years after damage or destruction. If a principal structure is not substantially damaged and only a portion of the structure has been damaged or destroyed, only that portion may be repaired or replaced. The height of an original principal structure and area encompassed by the original footprint cannot be increased, unless necessary to comply with the requirements of KPB 21.06. The structure must be similar in size and use to the structure being repaired or replaced. Repair, replacement, or reconstruction may only encompass the same square footage that the structure occupied prior to damage or destruction, and the structure must be more compliant with this chapter which shall be determined by application of mitigation measures set forth in KPB 21.18.091 to the maximum extent practicable. Staff will determine the mitigation measures to be used consistent with the following conditions: 
a.  The structure will not increase significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems; 
b.  Permitting repair, reconstruction, or replacement shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter as set forth in KPB 21.18.020, the borough comprehensive plan, another applicable chapters of the borough code, and other applicable planning documents adopted by the borough; 
c.  The reconstruction, replacement, or repair will not physically damage the adjoining property; 
d.  Removal of materials or debris remaining from the damage or destruction; and 
e.  Owner's compliance with other borough permits and ordinance requirements. 
2.  The right to reconstruct in nonconformity with the chapter is forever lost if: 
a.  the application for reconstruction or repair is not made within 24 months after the date of accidental damage or destruction or within 6 months prior to the owner's intentional damage or destruction or 
b.  the application is approved but the structure is not substantially reconstructed within 36 months of the date of the approval of the application for reconstruction. 
(i)  For reasonable and sufficient cause shown for the delay, the director of planning may authorize an extension not to exceed 12 months to complete reconstruction. 
(ii)  To obtain an extension of time an applicant shall submit a written request for an extension to the planning department prior to the expiration of the 36 months reconstruction period. The applicant must show reasonable and sufficient cause for the extension. 
3.  Nothing in this section prohibits reconstruction at any time in compliance with this chapter. 
4.  The provisions applicable to principal prior existing structures set forth in KPB 21.18.090(C)(1), (2), (3) also apply to the replacement, repair or reconstruction of accessory structures within the habitat protection district. In addition to those provisions the following rules apply to accessory structures: 
a.  Accessory structures may be replaced or reconstructed outside of the habitat protection district without a KPB 21.18 permit. 
b.  The applicant must document the specific circumstances that would prevent the accessory structure from being located outside of the habitat protection district in order to be permitted to replace, or reconstruct the accessory structure within the habitat protection district. 
5.  Any prior existing structure which has been declared a public nuisance, health or fire hazard pursuant to KPB 21.16.010 shall thereafter not be conducted, used or occupied except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The Planning Department may require removal of structures which have been declared a public nuisance, health or fire hazard pursuant to KPB 21.16.010. 
D.  Uses. This chapter shall not prohibit or restrict uses which were legally conducted before the effective date of this section, provided that, after the effective date, such uses are conducted in the same location and are not enlarged to include a greater number of participants or to occupy a greater area of land. Any prior existing use which has ceased to be used, for forty eight consecutive months or more, shall be considered abandoned and thereafter not be conducted, used or occupied except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Upon application and approval of a prior existing structure/use permit by planning department staff a change to the prior existing use may be allowed. No change shall be granted unless the change reduces the noncompliance, by use of mitigation procedures set forth in KPB 21.18.091, to the maximum extent practicable. Staff will determine the mitigation measures to be used consistent with the following conditions: 
1.  The use will not increase significant erosion, sedimentation, damage to the habitat protection district, an increase in ground or surface water pollution, and damage to riparian wetlands and riparian ecosystems; 
2.  Permitting the use shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter as set forth in KPB 21.18.020, the borough comprehensive plan, another applicable chapters of the borough code, and other applicable planning documents adopted by the borough; 
3.  The use will not physically damage the adjoining property; 
4.  Removal of materials or debris resulting from the prior-existing use; and 
5.  Owner's compliance with other borough permits and ordinance requirements. 
E.  Impervious materials placed in the habitat protection district which are not structures are not allowed as either prior existing uses or prior existing structures. The planning department may require removal of these materials. 
F.  Planning department determinations regarding prior existing structures and prior existing uses may be appealed to the planning commission. 
G.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any change of tenancy, ownership or management of any prior existing structure.

21.18.091. - Mitigation measures. 
    Mitigation measures may be required by planning department staff to address impacts to the habitat protection district from a proposed, ongoing, or completed project. These measures may include, but are not limited to: 
A.  Standard erosion and storm water runoff control measures; 
B.  Restoration and maintenance of native vegetation and water quality protection functions; 
C.  Restoration and maintenance of native vegetation and water quality protection functions along areas that immediately abut the habitat protection district; 
D.  Removal of non-conforming accessory structures from the habitat protection district; 
E.  Other measures as agreed upon by the planning department and applicant. Examples include removal of seawalls, riprap, jetties, and other structures that may be detrimental to fish habitat; installation of approved bank protection measures; professional evaluation of privately owned waste water treatment system; removal of materials, structures and other items that may be present in the habitat protection district or along the shore.

21.18.100. - Administration by cities-Delegation-Legal proceedings. 
A.  The administration and enforcement of this ordinance may be undertaken by a city. 
B.  A city may adopt the standards established in this chapter or prescribe standards more stringent than those established in this chapter for the areas of the city within the habitat protection area or other areas regulated by this chapter. A conditional use permit issued by a city planning commission may serve to satisfy the requirements of 21.18.072 and 21.18.080. 
C.  A city wishing to administer and enforce this chapter shall enact an ordinance adopting the provisions of this chapter by reference, providing the city will undertake the administration in conjunction with the administration of land use regulations and building and health codes enacted by the city. Within 30 days of passage of the ordinance the mayor shall transfer the administration and enforcement to the city. The city may relinquish and transfer the administration and enforcement back to the borough by ordinance, however the transfer shall not take effect until 90 days after the city approves the transfer or the commencement of a new fiscal year for the borough, whichever is greater. 
D.  If a city assumes administration of this chapter, conditional use permit determinations shall be made by the city planning commission, or by the city council, as provided by city ordinance. Appeals or legal proceedings taken from actions of the city in administering shall be the sole responsibility of the city.

21.28.020. - Standards for concentrated animal feeding operations. 
A.  The following standards and requirements apply to conditional land use permits issued for CAFOs: 
1.  State and federal permits. All applicable federal and state permits must be obtained by an operator prior to submitting a CAFO application to the borough. These permits may include, but are not limited to, State of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Governmental Coordinator permits and Federal Alaska Department of Fish and Game, State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and Federal Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture permits. It is the responsibility of the applicant to determine and acquire the necessary permits. 
2.  CAFOs shall be operated to minimize the negative impacts on surrounding residential uses and air quality and prevent all water contamination. 
3.  Transportation of waste, animals or other transportation related to the operation of the CAFO shall not damage borough roads. 
(Ord. No. 2002-14, § 3, 6-4-02) 
21.28.030. - Permit conditions. 
A.  The following are conditions for CAFO permits: 
1.  Fence. If CAFO operations are conducted outside buildings, there shall be a vegetative buffer or fence made of material approved in the CLUP sufficient to contain and screen the operations from view. 
2.  Setback. 
a.  There shall be a setback of all CAFO operations, including buildings, sheds, pens, animals, shelters, feeding areas and watering troughs, storage areas and waste areas, of 100 feet from the boundaries of the parcel. 
b.  The parcel boundaries of a CAFO must be one mile from the parcel boundaries of existing residences and buildings open to the public. 
c.  Animal waste facilities shall be no less than 660 feet from adjoining property lines and domestic ground and surface water supplies. 
3.  All state and federal permits must remain in good standing. 
4.  The task force may require a bond or other reasonable surety in an amount adequate to protect the deleterious affects of violated permit conditions. 
5.  The task force may require an odor abatement plan based on the recommendations of the consultant retained pursuant to KPB 21.28.040. The odor abatement plan may address issues, including but not limited to, schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to diminish off-site odor. 
6.  Other conditions appropriate to meet the standards set forth in KPB 21.28.020. 
B.  The permit must state whether it is being issued for an entire parcel or a portion of parcel. If the permit is issued for a portion of a parcel, the location on the parcel must be defined on the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2002-14, § 3, 6-4-02) 
21.28.040. - Civil engineer report. 
    The application for a CAFO shall be submitted to a licensed professional civil engineer or other qualified professional consultant for a review and report regarding the impact on borough roads, water and air quality and shall be required as a condition of the permit. More than one consultant may be retained as necessary to evaluate the application. Recommendations shall be included as part of the report regarding additional permit conditions to mitigate negative impacts on air and water quality and borough roads. The consultant shall be retained by the borough and the cost defrayed by applicant prior to processing the permit application. 
(Ord. No. 2002-14, § 3, 6-4-02) 
21.28.050. - Prior existing uses. 
A.  CAFOs are not required to obtain a CLUP if use as a CAFO commenced or was operated before June 4, 2002 provided that the subject use continues on the same parcel. In no event shall a prior existing use be expanded beyond the smaller of the lot, block, or tract lines as they existed on June 4, 2002. If a parcel is further subdivided after June 4, 2002, the pre-existing use may not be expanded beyond the boundaries of the lots, tracts, or parcels it occupied on June 4, 2002. 
B.  Owners of preexisting CAFOs must apply to be registered as a prior existing use prior to June 2, 2003. If the application is denied or untimely filed, the operator must comply with provisions of this chapter. Such registration shall include the same information required by KPB 21.28.010, and an affidavit by the owner as to the date since which such nonconforming use has existed. A fee may be charged as set by planning commission resolution. 
C.  The planning director shall make determinations regarding prior existing use status. Notice and an opportunity to make written comments regarding prior existing use status shall be issued to owners of property in a one-half mile radius of the site. After receiving written comments, the planning director may decide whether to register the prior existing use or refer the matter to the planning commission for public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given to persons filing written comments with the planning director prior to the hearing. If the planning director makes a determination, written findings shall be included in the decision which shall be distributed to all persons making written comments. The planning director's decision granting or denying registration may be appealed to the planning commission within 15 days of the date of the notice of decision. 
(Ord. No. 2002-14, § 3, 6-4-02) 
21.28.060. - Permit revocation and renewal. 
A.  A permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be revoked by the hearing officer pursuant to KPB 21.50 if the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The borough clerk shall provide at least 15 days' written notice to the permittee of a revocation hearing. The notice shall provide specific grounds for the proposed revocation. If the permittee provides written evidence to the planning director demonstrating reasonable compliance with this chapter within the 15-day period, then the revocation hearing may be canceled, at the discretion of the planning director. 
B.  CAFO operators must apply for permit renewal every five years after the resolution originally granting the permit is recorded. Failure to apply for renewal subjects the operator to permit revocation proceedings. The mayor may reestablish a task force to review the renewal. An appeal of the denial may be taken to the planning commission within 15 days of distribution of the written notice of denial. A renewal application shall be processed pursuant to KPB 21.28.010-030 with public notice given as provided by KPB 21.25.060 when operators request modification of their permit conditions based on changes in operations set forth in the renewal application. 
(Ord. No. 2011-34, § 9, 10-11-11; Ord. No. 2002-14, § 3, 6-4-02) 
CHAPTER 21.29. - MATERIAL SITE PERMITS 

21.29.010. - Material extraction exempt from obtaining a permit. 
A.  Material extraction which disturbs an area of less than one acre that is not in a mapped flood plain or subject to 21.29.010(B), does not enter the water table, and does not cross property boundaries, does not require a permit. There will be no excavation within 20 feet of a right-of-way or within ten feet of a lot line. 
B.  Material extraction taking place on dewatered bars within the confines of the Snow River and the streams within the Seward-Bear Creek Flood Service Area does not require a permit, however, operators subject to this exemption shall provide the planning department with the information required by KPB 21.29.030(A)(1), (2), (6), (7) and a current flood plain development permit prior to beginning operations. 
C.  A prior existing use under KPB 21.29.120 does not require a material extraction permit, but a floodplain development permit is required for all activities within any mapped special flood hazard area. 
( Ord. No. 2013-29, § 11, 8-6-13; Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.020. - Material extraction and activities requiring a permit. 
A.  Counter permit. A counter permit is required for material extraction which disturbs no more than 2.5 cumulative acres and does not enter the water table. Counter permits are approved by the planning director, and are not subject to the notice requirements or planning commission approval of KPB 21.25.060. A counter permit is valid for a period of 12 months, with a possible 12-month extension. 
B.  Conditional land use permit. A conditional land use permit (CLUP) is required for material extraction which disturbs more than 2.5 cumulative acres, or material extraction of any size that enters the water table. A CLUP is required for materials processing. A CLUP is valid for a period of five years. The provisions of KPB Chapter 21.25 are applicable to material site CLUPS and the provisions of KPB 21.25 and 21.29 are read in harmony. If there is a conflict between the provisions of KPB 21.25 and 21.29, the provisions of KPB 21.29 are controlling. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.030. - Application procedure.

(Ord. No. 2011-32, § 33, 9-20-11; Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.040. - Standards for sand, gravel or material sites. 
A.  These material site regulations are intended to protect against aquifer disturbance, road damage, physical damage to adjacent properties, dust, noise, and visual impacts. Only the conditions set forth in KPB 21.29.050 may be imposed to meet these standards: 
1.  Protects against the lowering of water sources serving other properties; 
2.  Protects against physical damage to other properties; 
3.  Minimizes off-site movement of dust; 
4.  Minimizes noise disturbance to other properties; 
5.  Minimizes visual impacts; and 
6.  Provides for alternate post-mining land uses. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.050. - Permit conditions. 
A.  The following mandatory conditions apply to counter permits and CLUPs issued for sand, gravel or material sites: 
1.  Parcel boundaries. All boundaries of the subject parcel shall be staked at sequentially visible intervals where parcel boundaries are within 300 feet of the excavation perimeter. Field verification and staking will require the services of a professional land surveyor. Stakes shall be in place at time of application. 
2.  Buffer zone. A buffer zone shall be maintained around the excavation perimeter or parcel boundaries. Where an easement exists, a buffer shall not overlap the easement, unless otherwise conditioned by the planning director or planning commission. 
a.  The buffer zone shall provide and retain a basic buffer of: 
i.  50 feet of undisturbed natural vegetation, or 
ii.  A minimum six-foot earthen berm with at least a 2:1 slope, or 
iii.  A minimum six-foot fence. 
b.  A 2:1 slope shall be maintained between the buffer zone and excavation floor on all inactive site walls. Material from the area designated for the 2:1 slope may be removed if suitable, stabilizing material is replaced within 30 days from the time of removal. 
c.  The planning commission or planning director shall designate one or a combination of the above as it deems appropriate. The vegetation and fence shall be of sufficient height and density to provide visual and noise screening of the proposed use as deemed appropriate by the planning commission or planning director. 
d.  Buffers shall not cause surface water diversion which negatively impacts adjacent properties or water bodies. Specific findings are required to alter the buffer requirements of KPB 21.29.050(A)(2)(a) in order to minimize negative impacts from surface water diversion. For purposes of this section, surface water diversion is defined as erosion, flooding, dehydration or draining, or channeling. Not all surface water diversion results in a negative impact. 
e.  At its discretion, the planning commission may waive buffer requirements where the topography of the property or the placement of natural barriers makes screening not feasible or not necessary. Buffer requirements shall be made in consideration of and in accordance with existing uses of adjacent property at the time of approval of the permit. There is no requirement to buffer the material site from uses which commence after the approval of the permit. 
3.  Processing. In the case of a CLUP, any equipment which conditions or processes material must be operated at least 300 feet from the parcel boundaries. At its discretion, the planning commission may waive the 300-foot processing distance requirement, or allow a lesser distance in consideration of and in accordance with existing uses of adjacent property at the time. 
4.  Water source separation. 
a.  All permits shall be issued with a condition which prohibits any material extraction within 100 horizontal feet of any water source existing prior to original permit issuance. 
b.  All counter permits shall be issued with a condition which requires that a four-foot vertical separation from the seasonal high water table be maintained. 
c.  All CLUPS shall be issued with a condition which requires that a two-foot vertical separation from the seasonal high water table be maintained. 
d.  There shall be no dewatering either by pumping, ditching or some other form of draining unless an exemption is granted by the planning commission. The exemption for dewatering may be granted if the operator provides a statement under seal and supporting data from a duly licensed and qualified impartial civil engineer, that the dewatering will not lower any of the surrounding property's water systems and the contractor posts a bond for liability for potential accrued damages. 
5.  Excavation in the water table. Excavation in the water table greater than 300 horizontal feet of a water source may be permitted with the approval of the planning commission based on the following: 
a.  Certification by a qualified independent civil engineer or professional hydrogeologist that the excavation plan will not negatively impact the quantity of an aquifer serving existing water sources. 
b.  The installation of a minimum of three water monitoring tubes or well casings as recommended by a qualified independent civil engineer or professional hydrogeologist adequate to determine flow direction, flow rate, and water elevation. 
c.  Groundwater elevation, flow direction, and flow rate for the subject parcel, measured in three-month intervals by a qualified independent civil engineer or professional hydrogeologist, for at least one year prior to application. Monitoring tubes or wells must be kept in place, and measurements taken, for the duration of any excavation in the water table. 
d.  Operations shall not breach an aquifer-confining layer. 
6.  Waterbodies. 
a.  An undisturbed buffer shall be left and no earth material extraction activities shall take place within 100 linear feet from a lake, river, stream, or other water body, including riparian wetlands and mapped floodplains as defined in KPB 21.06. This regulation shall not apply to man-made waterbodies being constructed during the course of the materials extraction activities. In order to prevent discharge, diversion, or capture of surface water, an additional setback from lakes, rivers, anadromous streams, and riparian wetlands may be required. 
b.  Counter permits and CLUPS may contain additional conditions addressing surface water diversion. 
7.  Fuel storage. Fuel storage for containers larger than 50 gallons shall be contained in impermeable berms and basins capable of retaining 110 percent of storage capacity to minimize the potential for uncontained spills or leaks. Fuel storage containers 50 gallons or smaller shall not be placed directly on the ground, but shall be stored on a stable impermeable surface. 
8.  Roads. Operations shall be conducted in a manner so as not to damage borough roads as required by KPB 14.40.175 and will be subject to the remedies set forth in KPB 14.40 for violation of this condition. 
9.  Subdivision. Any further subdivision or return to acreage of a parcel subject to a conditional land use or counter permit requires the permittee to amend their permit. The planning director may issue a written exemption from the amendment requirement if it is determined that the subdivision is consistent with the use of the parcel as a material site and all original permit conditions can be met. 
10.  Dust control. Dust suppression is required on haul roads within the boundaries of the material site by application of water or calcium chloride. 
11.  Hours of operation. Rock crushing equipment shall not be operated between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
12.  Reclamation. 
a.  Reclamation shall be consistent with the reclamation plan approved by the planning commission or planning director as appropriate in accord with KPB 21.29.060. 
b.  As a condition of issuing the permit, the applicant shall submit a reclamation plan and post a bond to cover the anticipated reclamation costs in an amount to be determined by the planning director. This bonding requirement shall not apply to sand, gravel or material sites for which an exemption from state bond requirements for small operations is applicable pursuant to AS 27.19.050. 
13.  Other permits. Permittee is responsible for complying with all other federal, state and local laws applicable to the material site operation, and abiding by related permits. These laws and permits include, but are not limited to, the borough's flood plain, coastal zone, and habitat protection regulations, those state laws applicable to material sites individually, reclamation, storm water pollution and other applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, clean water act and any other U.S. Army Corp of Engineer permits, any EPA air quality regulations, EPA and ADEC water quality regulations, EPA hazardous material regulations, U.S. Dept. of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations (including but not limited to noise and safety standards), and Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm regulations regarding using and storing explosives. Any violation of these regulations or permits reported to or observed by borough personnel will be forwarded to the appropriate agency for enforcement. 
14.  Voluntary permit conditions. Conditions may be included in the permit upon agreement of the permittee and approval of the planning commission for CLUPs or the planning director for counter permits. Such conditions must be consistent with the standards set forth in KPB 21.29.040(A). Planning commission approval of such conditions shall be contingent upon a finding that the conditions will be in the best interest of the borough and the surrounding property owners. Voluntary permit conditions apply to the subject parcel and operation, regardless of a change in ownership. A change in voluntary permit conditions may be proposed at permit renewal or amendment. 
15.  Signage. For permitted parcels on which the permittee does not intend to begin operations for at least 12 months after being granted a conditional land use permit, the permittee shall post notice of intent on parcel corners or access, whichever is more visible. Sign dimensions shall be no more than 15" by 15" and must contain the following information: the phrase "Permitted Material Site" along with the permittee's business name and a contact phone number. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.060. - Reclamation plan. 
A.  All material site permit applications require a reclamation plan. 
B.  The applicant shall revegetate with a non-invasive plant species and reclaim all disturbed land upon exhausting the material on-site, or within a pre-determined time period for long-term activities, so as to leave the land in a stable condition. Reclamation must occur for all exhausted areas of the site exceeding five acres before a five-year renewal permit is issued, unless otherwise required by the planning commission. If the material site is one acre or less in size and has been granted a CLUP due to excavation in the water table, reclamation must be performed as specified by the planning commission or planning director in the conditional use or counter permit. 
C.  The following measures must be considered in preparing and implementing the reclamation plan, although not all will be applicable to every reclamation plan. 
1.  Topsoil that is not promptly redistributed to an area being reclaimed will be separated and stockpiled for future use. This material will be protected from erosion and contamination by acidic or toxic materials and preserved in a condition suitable for later use. 
2.  The area will be backfilled, graded and recontoured using strippings, overburden, and topsoil to a condition that allows for the reestablishment of renewable resources on the site within a reasonable period of time. It will be stabilized to a condition that will allow sufficient moisture for revegetation. 
3.  Sufficient quantities of stockpiled or imported topsoil will be spread over the reclaimed area to a depth of four inches to promote natural plant growth that can reasonably be expected to revegetate the area within five years. The applicant may use the existing natural organic blanket representative of the project area if the soil is found to have an organic content of 5% or more and meets the specification of Class B topsoil requirements as set by Alaska Test Method (ATM) T-6. The material shall be reasonably free from roots, clods, sticks, and branches greater than 3 inches in diameter. Areas having slopes greater than 2:1 require special consideration and design for stabilization by a licensed engineer. 
4.  Exploration trenches or pits will be backfilled. Brush piles and unwanted vegetation shall be removed from the site, buried or burned. Topsoil and other organics will be spread on the backfilled surface to inhibit erosion and promote natural revegetation. 
5.  Peat and topsoil mine operations shall ensure a minimum of two inches of suitable growing medium is left or replaced on the site upon completion of the reclamation activity (unless otherwise authorized). 
6.  Ponding may be used as a reclamation method as approved by the planning commission. 
D.  The plan shall describe the total acreage to be reclaimed each year, a list of equipment (type and quantity) to be used in reclamation, and a time schedule of reclamation measures. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.070. - Permit extension and revocation. 
A.  Conditional land use permittees must submit a request in writing for permit extension every five years after the permit is issued. Requests for permit extension must be made at least 30 days prior to permit expiration. Counter permittees must submit any request for a 12-month extension at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the original 12-month permit period. 
B.  A permit extension certificate for a CLUP may be granted by the planning director after 5 years, and after one year for a counter permit where no modification to operations or conditions are proposed. 
C.  Permit extension may be denied if: (1) reclamation required by this chapter and the original permit has not been performed; (2) the permittee is otherwise in noncompliance with the original permit conditions; or (3) the permittee has had a permit violation in the last two years and has not fulfilled compliance requests. 
D.  A modification application shall be processed pursuant to KPB 21.29.030-050 with public notice given as provided by KPB 21.25.060 when operators request modification of their permit conditions based on changes in operations set forth in the modification application. 
E.  There shall be no fee for permit extensions approved by the planning director. The fee for a permit modification processed under KPB 21.29.070(D) will be the same as an original permit application in the amount listed in the most current Kenai Peninsula Borough Schedule of Rates, Charges and Fees. 
F.  Failure to submit a request for extension will result in the expiration of the permit. The borough may issue a permit termination document upon expiration pursuant to KPB 21.29.080. Once a permit has expired, a new permit application approval process is required in order to operate the material site. 
G.  Permits may be revoked pursuant to KPB 21.50. 
(Ord. No. 2011-34, § 10, 10-11-11; Ord. No. 2011-32, § 34, 9-20-11; Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.080. - Permit termination. 
    When a permit expires, is revoked, or a permittee requests termination of their permit, a review of permit conditions and site inspections will be conducted by the planning department to ensure code compliance and verify site reclamation prior to termination. When the planning director determines that a site qualifies for termination, a termination document shall be issued to the permittee. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.090. - Permit modifications. 
    If a permittee revises or intends to revise operations (at a time other than permit extension) so that they are no longer consistent with the original application, a permit modification is required. The planning director shall determine whether the revision to operations requires a modification. Permit modification shall be processed in the same manner as original permits. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.100. - Recordation. 
    All permits, permit extensions, modified permits, prior existing uses, and terminations shall be recorded. Failure to record a material site document does not affect the validity of the documents. 
(Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.110. - Violations. 
A.  Violations of this chapter shall be governed by KPB 21.50. 
B.  In addition to the remedies provided in KPB 21.50, the planning director may require bonding in a form and amount adequate to protect the borough's interests for an owner or operator who has been cited for three violations of KPB 21.50, 21.25, and 21.29 within a three-year period. The violations need not be committed at the same material site. Failure to provide requested bonding may result in permit revocation proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 2011-34, § 11, 10-11-11; Ord. No. 2006-01(S), § 1, 8-1-06) 
21.29.120. - Prior existing uses. 
A.  Material sites are not held to the standards and conditions of a CLUP if a prior existing use (PEU) determination was granted for the parcel in accordance with KPB 21.29.120(B). To qualify as a PEU, a parcel's use as a material site must have commenced or have been operated after May 21, 1986, and prior to May 21, 1996, provided that the subject use continues in the same location. In no event shall a prior existing use be expanded beyond the smaller of the lot, block, or tract lines as they existed on May 21, 1996. If a parcel is further subdivided after May 21, 1996, the pre-existing use may not be expanded to any lot, tract, or parcel where extraction had not occurred before or on February 16, 1999. If a parcel is subdivided where extraction has already occurred, the prior existing use is considered abandoned, and a CLUP must be obtained for each parcel intended for further material site operations. The parcel owner may overcome this presumption of abandonment by showing that the subdivision is not inconsistent with material site operation. If a parcel subject to a prior existing use is conveyed, the prior existing use survives the conveyance. 
B.  Owners of sites must have applied to be registered as a prior existing use prior to January 1, 2001. 
C.  Any prior existing use that has not operated as a material site between May 21, 1996, and May 21, 2011, is considered abandoned and must thereafter comply with the permit requirements of this chapter. The planning director shall determine whether a prior existing use has been abandoned. After giving notice to the parcel owner that a PEU is considered abandoned, a parcel owner may protest the termination of the PEU by filing written notice with the planning director on a form provided by the planning department. When a protest by a parcel owner is filed, notice and an opportunity to make written comments regarding prior existing use status shall be issued to owners of property within a one-half mile radius of the parcel boundaries of the site. The owner of the parcel subject to the prior existing use may submit written information, and the planning director may gather and consider any information relevant to whether a material site has operated.

    This chapter shall be titled the "North Fork One Zoning District." 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.030. - Area. 
A.  Within the rural district, the North Fork One zoning district is established and encompasses the parcels set forth in this section within the Homer Recording District, Third Judicial District, State of Alaska: 
B.  The following parcels comprise the single-family residential (R-1) zone:

Trident Subdivision, Block 1, Lots 1-8, according to Plat 76-69 filed in the Homer Recording District; and 
Spruceridge Subdivision, Tracts 5-7, according to Plat 76-49 filed in the Homer Recording District. 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.040. - Application. 
    The regulations set by this chapter shall apply uniformly to the district. 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.050. - Zoning map. 
    The Kenai Peninsula Borough base maps (scale 1:500) shall be the official zoning map. The official zoning map shall show the boundaries of this district. 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.060. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Any structure, which existed prior to the adoption of this chapter but does not meet the provisions of this chapter, shall be allowed to continue subject to the following conditions: 
A.  No alterations may be made which increase the nonconformity; 
B.  Any nonconforming building which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or by a public enemy to the extent of sixty percent or more of its assessed valuation, shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this ordinance. Where more than forty percent of the assessed value of the building remains after such damage, such structure may be restored to the same nonconforming use as existed before such damage. 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.070. - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Determination. Nonconforming uses in effect on the date of initial adoption of KPB 21.40 are permitted to continue operation. The burden of proof that the nonconforming use existed before adoption of this chapter is on the applicant. If the planning director denies nonconforming use status, the applicant must qualify for a home occupation permit in order to continue the use. Failure to apply for a nonconforming use determination within 60 days after receiving written notice from the borough shall result in termination of all right to continued operation as a nonconforming use and require full conformance with all provisions of this chapter. Written notice of the nonconforming use application requirements shall be given by certified mail or personal delivery to the property owner or operator of the nonconforming use. If notice cannot effectively be given by these methods, the planning director may post the subject property. 
B.  Decision. The planning director shall give notice of the application to property owners within the district. The notice shall include a summary of the application, a vicinity map, and a deadline for submitting written comments or evidence regarding the existence of the use prior to making a determination. The planning director shall issue a decision regarding the nonconforming status based on the written application, written comments, or evidence regarding the existence of the use prior to the adoption of this chapter. The planning director's decision may be appealed to the planning commission within 15 days of distribution of the decision pursuant to KPB 21.20. 
C.  Discontinuance. Any nonconforming use of land or building which has ceased by discontinuance for a period of two years shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter. Lack of intent to cease use or abandon the use does not suspend the two-year time period after the use has been discontinued. 
D.  Expansion prohibited. A nonconforming use of a building may not be increased, intensified, or expanded or moved to any other part of the lot, tract, or parcel it occupies at the time this chapter is adopted, nor may the use be moved to a parcel, lot or tract which is subject to this chapter. 
E.  Change of use. The use of a nonconforming building may be changed only to a use conforming to this chapter. 
F.  Standards. In order to qualify as an allowed nonconforming use, a use must be operational. The purchase, clearing, or improvement of land preparatory to the use is inadequate to qualify the parcel for nonconforming use status, unless the site has been prepared or construction completed to the extent that it is no longer feasible to use the property for a conforming use. 
(Ord. No. 99-54, § 1, 10-12-99) 
21.40.080. - Principal permitted uses.

15.  Sawmill/lumber yard; and

C.  Permit-decision; findings. Any proposed home occupation that is not specifically prohibited by subsection (B) shall be likened to the nearest use in terms of impact on the neighborhood and properties and residents within the zoning district. Permitted home occupations must not detract from the quiet, and aesthetic qualities of a single-family residential neighborhood nor negatively impact property values and the health, safety, and welfare of the district's residents. The planning commission may grant a permit upon finding that the home occupation will not create negative impacts in the zoning district similar to those caused by uses prohibited as home occupations. If the proposed home occupation is found to have similar impacts as a prohibited use the planning commission may deny the permit. The home occupation must be able to meet the conditions set forth in KPB 21.40.100 in order to be permitted. However, the planning commission may grant the permit if it finds that placing conditions on the permit sufficiently negates the home occupation's negative impacts and will aid compliance with the conditions set forth in KPB 21.40.100(D). Any permit approval or denial must be accompanied by written findings of fact and conclusions. 
D.  Mandatory permit conditions. Upon finding that the home occupation will not violate the standards set forth in Section 21.40.100(C), the planning commission may grant a permit subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Only permanent occupants of the premises engage in such occupation; 
2.  The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation is clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants; 
3.  There is no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation other than one sign, not exceeding two square feet in area, non-illuminated and mounted flat against the wall of the principal building; 
4.  Sewerage, water use, parking, and traffic is not generated by such home occupation in greater volumes than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood; specifically not more than five additional vehicles per day on average will be drawn to the lot as a result of the home occupation; 
5.  Equipment or process is not used in the home occupation that creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, dust, or commercial electrical interference detectable to the normal senses off the lot. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off the lot, or causes fluctuations in line voltage off the lot; 
6.  Outdoor storage of materials or equipment is not required for the home occupation; 
7.  There is no storage of toxic, explosive, or other dangerous or hazardous materials, substances, or chemicals upon the premises. 
8.  A home occupation, including studios or rooms for instruction, shall provide off-street parking area adequate to accommodate needs created by the home occupation, however the home occupation shall generate no more vehicles to the premises than allowed by the planning commission. 
9.  All borough taxes related to the home occupation and underlying realty shall remain current throughout the life of the permit. 
10.  An application for renewal of the permit shall be filed every five years or in accordance with current Borough code. 
11.  The planning commission may require additional conditions consistent with the provisions of KPB 20.40.100(C) and (D) that protect the health, safety and welfare of residents in the district. 
E.  Permit application. An applicant for a home occupation may obtain a permit application from the planning department. The application shall include at a minimum the name, physical and mailing address, and phone number of the applicant; the type of home occupation; equipment or machinery used in the occupation; a borough tax compliance certificate; a parking and traffic circulation plan; a drawn site plan; photographs of the premises, any requested variances, and additional information required to aid the planning commission's review. Staff may perform a site inspection as part of the application and compliance processes. An applicant who is a resident, but not the owner, of the premises must have the owner's notarized permission to proceed with the home occupation. An application fee may be established by planning commission resolution. 
F.  Activities not covered. A home occupation permit is not required for a home office, tutoring, or telecommuting which involves no outside sign, no increase in traffic to the premises, violates none of the conditions set forth in 21.40.100 (D) and creates no visits by members of the public to the home. 
G.  Permit renewal. Every five years a home occupation permittee shall apply for a renewal permit. If the planning director determines that the permittee continues to meet the standards set forth in KPB 21.40.100, the permit shall be granted. If it appears the permittee no longer meets the standards set forth in KPB 21.40.100, the planning director shall set the matter for a public hearing before the planning commission with notice of the hearing issued to property owners within the district. If a public hearing is required, a renewal fee is also required as established by planning commission resolution. The planning commission shall make a determination whether the permittee continues to meet the KPB 21.40.100 standards.

1.  control building sites, placement of structures and land uses through: 
a.  separating conflicting land uses, 
b.  regulating certain uses detrimental to residential areas, 
c.  setting minimum lot sizes, widths and setback standards, 
d.  setting standards for the number and type of structures developed on a parcel; 
2.  preserve open space; and 
3.  provide consistency with the goals and objectives of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Comprehensive Plan and Coastal Management Program. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 (Sub.) , § 1, 5-3-16; Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 5-16-00) 
21.44.020. - State and federal agencies regulated. 
    To the extent allowed by law, all state and federal agencies are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 (Sub.) , § 1, 5-3-16; Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 5-16-00) 
21.44.030. - Formation methods. 
A.  Any number of property owners within the rural district interested in forming a local option zoning district (LOZD) may meet with the planning department to discuss application requirements and proposed LOZD boundaries. Application forms for LOZDs are available from, and shall be submitted to, the Borough Planning Department. The planning department shall process an application for an LOZD. 
B.  Any type of LOZD may be proposed at the time of preliminary or final plat approval. Recommendations for a specific LOZD must be in concurrence with the current owners of the property subject to the plat. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the assembly regarding the formation of the LOZD. Plats must be 12 contiguous lots or more, separated only by a street, alley, right-of-way, or easement. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 (Sub.) , § 1, 5-3-16; Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 5-16-00) 
21.44.040. - Formation requirements. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided, the minimum area that may be included in an LOZD is 12 lots. At least 30 percent of the lots within a proposed R-W district must be waterfront lots. Lots in an LOZD must be contiguous and separated only by a street, alley, right-of-way, or easement. The Planning Department shall create a proposed local option zoning map for a proposed district based on land use, location, access, soils, topography, availability of utilities, encumbrances and permits. 
B.  An LOZD formed under KPB 21.44.030(A) requires an application signed by the record owners of at least six lots within the proposed LOZD. The applicants shall be owners of parcels proposed for regulation, except that the Kenai Peninsula Borough may not be a signatory on such an application unless it is the sole owner of all lots within the LOZD. The formation of the LOZD may include portions of subdivisions. The application shall: 
1.  show opposite each signature of an applicant lot owner, a street address if available and adequate legal description of the property owned, 
2.  set forth whether the district will form a R-1, R-2, R-R, R-W, R-M or C-3 zone, and 
3.  include a map of the proposed LOZD area. 
C.  The planning department shall hold a meeting in a public facility regarding the application. After considering the standards set forth in KPB 21.44.010(A) and land attributes set forth in KPB 21.44.040(A) the planning department shall make a recommendation to the planning commission and assembly regarding the formation and boundaries of the proposed LOZD. The date of introduction for assembly consideration of the LOZD shall be within 90 days after filing the completed application with the planning department. 
D.  The date of application shall be the date for determining whether a proposed LOZD meets the formation requirements set forth in this section. If there is an approved preliminary plat within the area of the proposed LOZD that does not meet the formation requirements for the type of LOZD proposed the area may not be included in the LOZD. 
E.  The owner of a parcel contiguous to a proposed LOZD which is larger than the maximum allowed lot size within the LOZD may request that the borough include the parcel in the LOZD. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 (Sub.) , § 1, 5-3-16; Ord. No. 2010-23, § 2, 6-22-10; Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 5-16-00) 
21.44.050 - Public hearings and notification requirements. 
    The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on local option zoning applications. Public notice of the hearing shall comply with KPB 21.11.020. In addition, property owners within the proposed district and within 300 feet of the boundaries of the district shall receive a copy of the public notice at least seven days prior to the hearing. The planning commission shall recommend to the assembly approval, disapproval, or modifications of the proposed LOZD. The planning department shall distribute a summary of the LOZD's regulations and boundaries to property owners within the proposed LOZD. The summary shall include an opportunity for property owners to show support for the LOZD by their signature. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 (Sub.) , § 1, 5-3-16; Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 5-16-00) 
21.44.060. - Assembly action. 
A.  The assembly shall approve, disapprove, or modify the proposed LOZD. The assembly, in its legislative capacity, may disapprove an LOZD notwithstanding the district's meeting the criteria of this chapter. 
B.  Any LOZD approved must meet the formation criteria set forth in KPB 21.44.040 and the minimum requirements of the LOZD being formed. 
C.  Prior to introduction to the assembly the planning department will provide the owners of each parcel within the proposed LOZD a summary statement of the LOZD's regulations and boundaries as required by KPB 21.44.050. In order for the LOZD to be submitted to the assembly for introduction the owners of 60 percent of the parcels within the LOZD must be in favor of formation of the LOZD as represented by a parcel owner's signature on the LOZD summary distributed by the planning department. If the borough owns less than 100 percent of the parcels in the proposed LOZD, it may not sign the summary. Additionally, in that case the 60 percent requirement shall be calculated by first subtracting from the total number of parcels in the LOZD the number of parcels owned by the borough. The owners of 60 percent of the remaining parcels must sign the LOZD summary for the LOZD to be submitted to the assembly.

    Any structure, which existed prior to the formation of an LOZD that does not meet the provisions of this chapter, shall be allowed to continue subject to the following conditions: 
A.  No alterations may be made which increase the nonconformity; 
B.  Any prior existing building which has been destroyed or damaged to the extent of 50 percent or more of the assessed value of the structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter. The right to reconstruct in nonconformity with this chapter is forever lost if 
1.  the application for reconstruction is not made within 12 months of the date of damage, or 
2.  the application for reconstruction is approved but the structure is not reconstructed within 24 months of the date of the approval of the application for reconstruction.

21.44.110. - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Determination. Nonconforming uses in effect on the date of initial adoption of the LOZD are allowed to continue operation. The burden of proof that the nonconforming use existed before adoption of an LOZD is on the applicant. If the planning director denies nonconforming use status, the applicant must comply with the requirements of the LOZD. Failure to apply for a nonconforming use determination within one year from the date of notice of the adoption of an LOZD ordinance shall result in termination of all right to continued operation as a nonconforming use and require full compliance with all provisions of this chapter. Written notice of the nonconforming use application requirements shall be given by certified mail or personal delivery to all property owners within an LOZD. If notice cannot effectively be given by these methods, the planning director may post the subject property. 
B.  Decision. The planning director shall give notice of the application for a nonconforming use determination to property owners within the district. The notice shall include a summary of the application, a vicinity map, and a deadline for submitting written comments or evidence regarding the existence of the use prior to making a determination. The planning director shall issue a decision regarding the nonconforming status based on the written application, written comments, or evidence regarding the existence of the use prior to the adoption of an LOZD. The planning director's decision may be appealed by the applicant or affected property owners to the planning commission within 15 days of distribution of the decision. 
C.  Discontinuance. Any nonconforming use of land or building which has ceased by discontinuance for an uninterrupted period of 365 days shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter. Lack of intent to cease use or abandon the use does not suspend the 365-day time period. If a nonconforming use of a temporary structure is discontinued, it shall not be recommenced. 
D.  Expansion Prohibited. A nonconforming use of a building or land may not be increased, intensified, or expanded or moved to any other part of the lot, tract, or parcel it occupies after the ordinance forming the district is adopted, nor may the use be moved to a parcel which is subject to this chapter. 
E.  Change of Use. The use of a nonconforming building may be changed only to a use conforming to this chapter. 
F.  Standards. In order to qualify as an allowed nonconforming use, the use must meet the following standards on the date the assembly approves formation of the district: 
1.  A use must have been legally established under prior law. 
2.  A use must be operational in accordance with the type of use. 
3.  The purchase, clearing, or improvement of land preparatory to the use is inadequate to qualify the parcel for nonconforming use status, unless the site has been prepared or construction completed to the extent that it is no longer feasible to use the property for a conforming use. 
G.  Conditions may be placed on nonconforming uses by the planning director to protect the residential character of the LOZD by limiting excessive noise, excessive traffic, fire hazards, and to provide appropriate screening, lighting, and hours of operation.

2.  The hearing officer is authorized to admit or exclude evidence and to rule upon all objections regarding evidence. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. The hearing officer shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by the Alaska Rules of Evidence. An erroneous ruling on the admission or exclusion of evidence shall not affect the validity of the hearing officer's decision unless the ruling is shown to have substantially prejudiced the rights of a party. 
3.  Relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of a common law or statutory rule which makes improper the admission of the evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay evidence may be considered provided there are guarantees of its trustworthiness and that it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure by reasonable efforts. 
4.  The hearing officer may take notice of judicially recognizable facts. The hearing officer shall notify the parties during the proceeding, and before the final decision, of material officially noticed and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the facts so noticed.

The hearing officer is not authorized to grant variances from the provisions of this title. 
G.  Within 10 days after completion of the presentation of evidence, and any closing argument that the hearing officer may permit, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision on all matters at issue under the enforcement notice, with supporting findings of fact and conclusions of law. The borough clerk shall distribute the decision to each party by personal delivery or certified mail, or by facsimile or email to a party who has consented in writing to service by facsimile or email. The decision shall include a concise disposition statement either prescribing the fine imposed and the remedy for each violation, dismissing the enforcement notice, or declaring such other specific relief ordered by the hearing officer within the hearing officer's jurisdiction as defined by KPB 21.50.110(B) A decision shall also identify the violator or violators to whom the remedy applies and indicate that it is appealable and set forth the method and timing for such appeal. The remedies may include: 
1.  An order to a violator to correct or abate the violation within a specified time, including without limitation any of the following: 
a.  To discontinue a use of land or a structure; 
b.  To abate or remove a condition or use of land, a structure, or a vehicle or other personal property 
c.  To repair, restore, modify or improve land or a structure; 
d.  To install any equipment necessary to correct or abate the violation; 
e.  To provide a certification by a licensed professional, including without limitation an engineer, surveyor, hydrologist or biologist, that a violation has been corrected or abated to the administrative official designated in the enforcement order. 
2.  An order to a violator to pay to the borough a fine. The fine shall not exceed $500 for each day of each such violation. Fines shall accrue from the date of the enforcement notice to the date the matter is initially set for hearing. Accumulated fines for each violation may not be reduced by the hearing officer to less than the equivalent of one day's fine. The hearing officer may suspend a portion of a fine for a violation as a condition of compliance with other portions of the decision. If a suspension of fine is ordered the respondent must pay not less than the equivalent of a one day fine. The hearing officer may not reduce or waive the double permit fee required by KPB 21.50.055(B). The fine shall be paid to the borough clerk who shall notify the administration of compliance with the order. 
3.  An order revoking a permit issued pursuant to this title. 
H.  In the case of an order under subsection G.1 the hearing officer retains jurisdiction of the matter, unless appealed, and the borough may apply to the hearing officer for additional relief to enforce compliance with the order. Such an application shall be processed in the same manner as an enforcement notice under KPB 21.50.100 through 21.50.130. Such an application is not exclusive of any other remedy that is available to the borough under this chapter or at law or in equity. 
I.  Violation of an enforcement order requiring actions set forth in KPB 21.50.130(G)(1) is a separate violation of this chapter.

If ten days pass without the hearing officer issuing a decision on the motion, the motion is considered denied. The motion for reconsideration shall not be granted without giving the parties not filing the motion an opportunity to respond to the motion. Where an opposition to the motion for reconsideration has been requested by the hearing officer and filed with the borough clerk by the respondent, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision on the matter. 
D.  The filing of a motion for reconsideration suspends the time in which an appeal must be taken to superior court. The time period in which to file an appeal shall begin when the hearing officer issues the decision on reconsideration or ten days after the motion for reconsideration is filed if the hearing officer does not issue a decision on the motion. 
E.  An appeal from a hearing officer decision under this section may be filed in the superior court within 30 days after the date of distribution of the hearing officer decision to the parties, and is governed by Part 6 of the Alaska Rules of Appellate Procedure. A hearing officer decision remains in effect while an appeal is pending unless stayed by the superior court.

B.  Before a civil action is filed to abate a violation, a final warning notice shall be posted on the property and served personally or by certified mail with return receipt requested to the violator and the owner of record of the property. The borough may request the court to order the violator(s) to abate the violation, or allow the borough to enter upon the property subject of the violation and abate the violation if the violator has failed or is unwilling or unable to abate the violation. The court may order the violator(s) to pay the costs of the borough's abatement of the violation. 
C.  The persons found in violation by the hearing officer are liable to the borough for the entire cost of the abatement, including incidental expenses. "Costs of abatement" include removal, repair and relocation and any other costs, including incidental costs, which are or would reasonably and necessarily be incurred to remedy or remove the violation or comply with the order of the hearing officer.

The three-minute limitation shall be strictly enforced by the president. At the request of an assembly member, with one week prior notice before an assembly meeting, teleconferencing may be set up from areas over 50 miles from the borough building on Binkley Street in Soldotna.

Any member of the public desiring to make a formal presentation before the borough assembly at a regular meeting concerning a subject not contained in the assembly's agenda for that meeting shall give notice to the borough clerk by the deadline for submitting items for the agenda set by KPB 22.40.050(C) and state the subject of the presentation. The total time permitted for formal presentations with prior notice concerning a subject not contained in the assembly's agenda for that meeting shall be limited to ten minutes per topic, regardless of the number of persons participating in the presentation. The aggregate time for presentations with prior notice shall be 20 minutes per meeting. If the total requests received exceed 20 minutes, the clerk shall schedule the requests by giving priority based on the order the requests were received. The assembly president may, with the concurrence of a majority of the assembly, allow additional time. This time limit shall not apply to formal presentations made at the request of the mayor or the assembly. This section does not preclude the borough clerk, with the approval of the assembly president, from scheduling presentations which will exceed ten minutes prior to the beginning of an assembly meeting or before the assembly as a committee of the whole. Any other formal presentations shall be made as approved in the agenda. 
C.  The time limits for presentations established by this section do not include time used in responding to questions from assembly members.

E.  "Teleconferencing," for purposes of KPB 22.40.170 through .175, means a method used for remote participation by an assembly member for a meeting of the assembly which must enable the remote member, for the duration of the meeting, to clearly hear all assembly members, the mayor, the borough clerk, the attorney, and public testimony, and to be clearly heard by all assembly members, the mayor, the borough clerk, the attorney, and the public in attendance. 
(Ord. No. 2017-06 , § 1, 5-2-17)

B.  At least three days prior to the scheduled time for the assembly meeting, the borough clerk shall notify the assembly of the person's request to participate by teleconference. 
C.  At the commencement of the assembly meeting a telephonic connection will be established with the person or persons intending to participate telephonically. If the assembly member has attended at least three regular assembly meetings by telephone since the most recent November 1, after a telephonic connection is established the assembly president shall call for a vote of the assembly on whether the person(s) may or may not participate by telephone. Prior to the vote, the assembly members may make such inquiries as necessary to make a decision. Only the assembly members physically present may vote on the question. The assembly's determination is final and not subject to appeal. If a person participates in the meeting telephonically without a ruling from the assembly, it shall be deemed to be with the approval of such participation by the assembly, and all actions taken by the assembly with the participation of all such persons are valid. 
D.  Subsections A, B and C of this section do not apply to special meetings of the assembly. An assembly member who requests to participate telephonically in a special meeting of the assembly must notify the borough clerk before the time scheduled for the start of the meeting. The borough clerk will notify the assembly no later than the commencement of the meeting. After a telephonic connection is established the member shall be allowed to participate telephonically. 
E.  The means used for a teleconference meeting of the assembly must enable each member appearing telephonically to clearly hear all other assembly members, the mayor, the borough clerk, the attorney, and public testimony at the meeting as well as be clearly heard by all other assembly members, the mayor, the borough clerk, the attorney, and members of the public in attendance. 
F.  The borough clerk shall note in the minutes of the assembly meeting all members appearing telephonically. 
G.  To the extent practicable, materials to be considered by the assembly shall be made available to those members attending by teleconference.

B.  Participation by teleconference may be denied whenever the physical presence of the individual is considered essential to effective participation in the meeting or to the proper conduct of the business to be addressed at the meeting. 
C.  If teleconferencing is denied the assembly member will be listed as absent. 
D.  Each assembly member may attend a maximum of three regular assembly meetings by teleconference during the 12-month period commencing November 1st each year. 
E.  Each assembly member may attend additional teleconferences as a special exception if expressly approved for good cause in each instance by a vote of the assembly. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, absence required for extended medical care needed for the individual or a member of the individual's immediate family. 
F.  No assembly member shall attend an executive session by telephonic means.

22.40.185. - Reconsideration-Procedure. 
A.  Notice of reconsideration of final assembly action on any matter must be given before adjournment of the meeting at which final action on the matter was taken. A motion for reconsideration of an adopted or defeated amendment to an ordinance or resolution may be made, but only if made prior to final assembly action on a matter. Items in which notice of reconsideration has been given shall not be discussed at committee and shall not appear on committee agendas. 
B.  An item for which notice of reconsideration was timely made shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular meeting, or special meeting called to consider that matter, and cannot be taken up at the meeting from which the action to be reconsidered was taken. 
C.  Assembly member debate, limited to the reasons for granting reconsideration, shall be permitted before calling the vote of whether to reconsider. 
D.  Action to reconsider a matter is taken by a positive vote of the majority of the total membership of the assembly. 
E.  The effect of granting reconsideration is to bring the entire matter back to the assembly in the form that it appeared prior to the final vote on the matter, and to reopen the matter for further amendment, including reconsideration of amendments made before final action on the matter being reconsidered. 
F.  No matter may be reconsidered if it has already been subject to a motion to reconsider, regardless of whether that motion to reconsider failed or passed. 
G.  A matter which was decided by a vote of three-fourths or more of the membership of the assembly is not subject to reconsideration under this section. 
H.  Notice of reconsideration may not be given where the effect would be to remove the action from the control of the assembly, including, but not limited to, situations where action must be taken by a certain time specified by law or procedural rules.

Subdivision design standards.
(a) elationship to Adjoining Street System. RThe arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they may be deemed necessary by the Commission for public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall be not less than the minimum widths established herein. The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Offset streets should be avoided. Streets obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. All proposed street names shall be checked against duplication of other street names.
(b) Street and Alley Width.
(1) The widths of major highways shall conform to the widths designated on the Major Street Plan.
(2) The minimum width for minor streets shall be sixty (60) feet, except that the Kenai City Planning and zoning Commission, may, in its discretion by majority vote of its members, lessen this distance to not less than fifty (50) feet. A wider street width may be required where the storm water is accommodated in an open ditch or in ditches along pavement. When minor streets adjoin unsubdivided property, a half street at least thirty (30) feet in width may be dedicated and whenever subdivided property adjoins a half street, the remainder of the street shall be dedicated.
(3) Alleys are not recommended in single and two-family residential districts; and when provided, a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be required. Alleys are required in the rear of all business lots and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide. There shall be prepared and maintained for public information, a set of standard specifications for all construction of any nature to any street, alley, easement, or other public way within the City of Kenai. Said specifications shall be prepared by the City Manager and shall be maintained as other public records.
(c) Easements. Easements of at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided on each side of rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary, for poles, wires, conduits, storm, and sanitary sewers, gas, water, or other mains. Wherever possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines. Easements of greater width may be required along or across lots where necessary for the extension of main sewers or other utilities or where both water and sewer lines are located in the same easement.
(d) Blocks.
(1) No block shall be longer than one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet. Where blocks are longer than one thousand (1,000) feet, a crosswalk at least ten (10) feet in width may be required near the center of the block.
(2) In platting residential lots containing less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet, the depth of the block should not exceed twice the minimum width allowed under the zone district in which the lot is located.
(3) Where a tract of land is of such size or location as to prevent a lot arrangement directly related to a normal street design, there may be established one or more courts, dead end streets, or other arrangements; provided, however, that proper access shall be given to all lots from a dedicated street or court. A dead end

The Kenai Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 3068-2019, passed June 19, 2019.
street shall terminate in an open space (preferably circular) having a minimum radius of fifty (50) feet. A dead end street shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
(e) Lots.
(1) The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and the character of surrounding development.
(2) All sidelines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines, except where a variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with double frontage shall be avoided.
(3) No lot shall have an area or width less than that required by the zoning ordinance.
(4) Where corner lots back upon lots facing the side street, the corner lot shall have an extra ten foot width sufficient to permit the establishment of front building lines on both the front and side of the lots adjoining the streets.
(5) In subdivisions where septic tanks or other individual sewage disposal devices are to be installed, the size of all lots included in such subdivision shall meet Kenai Peninsula Borough requirements.
(f) Character of Development. The subdivider shall confer with the Commission regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision, and may agree to place certain minimum restrictions upon the property to prevent the construction of substandard buildings, control the type of structures or the use of the lots which, unless so controlled, would clearly depreciate the character and value of the proposed subdivision and of adjoining property. Covenants running with the land may be included to provide for the creation of a Property Owners Association or Board of Trustees for the proper protection and maintenance of the development in the future, provided, however, that such covenants shall not contain reversionary clauses wherein any lots shall return to the subdivider because of a violation thereon of the terms of the covenants.
(g) Parks, Schools, and Sites. In subdividing property, consideration shall be given to suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other common areas for public use so as to conform to any recommendations of the City plan. Any provision for schools, parks, and playgrounds should be indicated on the preliminary plan in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be provided or acquired by the appropriate taxing agency.
(h) Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important drainage course is located in any area which is being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving, or protecting the stream for drainage purposes.

Such construction shall be subject to inspection and approval by the City Engineer or his equivalent under contract by the City, and shall comply with all applicable City standards for construction.
(d) Concrete sidewalks not less than four (4) feet in width shall be constructed along at least one side of all major streets and arterial streets. The Planning Commission may also require the construction of sidewalks along at least one side of minor streets. (In subdivision of ten (10) lots or less, the subdivider will include a covenant on the recorded plat that when an improvement district is formed, the real property involved will be a part of the improvement district without further action by the then owner of the property in question.)
(e) In subdivisions of ten (10) or more lots, an approved public water supply shall be provided for each lot within the subdivision area. Water mains shall be buried at least eight (8) feet deep with the depth to be determined by measuring from the grade line of the planned preliminary future street grades or, if there are no planned future street grades, from the natural grade of the adjacent right-of-way to the top of the main being installed. Fire hydrants shall also be installed in all subdivisions and in accordance with the specifications of the Nation Board of

(g) All necessary facilities, either underground pipe or drainage ditches, shall be installed to provide adequate disposal of surface water and to maintain any natural watercourses.
(1) In the event a subdivider is unable to comply with the requirements of this section, then any plat shall contain a covenant that all of the lots in any subdivision, as defined in this chapter, shall be subject to assessment for any of the improvements required herein when installed at a future time by the City, provided that insertion of covenants on a plat shall not be permitted in lieu of installation of street improvements for new subdivisions as provided in this section, except for subdivisions fronting on dedicated streets or streets dedicated in federal patents or in subdivisions of two and one-half (2 1/2) acre homesites (or smaller) owned by the original patentee.
(KC 14-20; Ord. 787)
14.10.090
Variations and exceptions.
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in these regulations would result in real difficulties, substantial hardship or injustice, the City Council, after report by the Planning Commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider may develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the City and surrounding areas are protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations preserved. (KC 14-21)
14.10.100
Enforcement.
(a) No plat of any subdivision shall be qualified for recording in the office of the district magistrate of the State of Alaska or have any validity until it shall have been approved in the manner prescribed herein.

14.20.050
Nonconforming lots, structures, and uses.
(a) Explanation. When a lot, structure, or use legally exists prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section but does not meet the requirements of this chapter, it shall be permitted to continue within the limits set forth in this section. Under such circumstances it is said to have nonconforming status. There are three (3) types of nonconforming status:
(1) Nonconforming Lots. The lot, width, or acreage is smaller than the minimum permitted in the zone in which it is located;
(2) Nonconforming Structures. The structure is designed to accommodate a nonconforming use or fails to meet yard, coverage, height, or other development requirements established for the zone in which it is located;
(3) Nonconforming Uses of Land and/or Structures. The use to which land and/or structures is being put is not a principal, accessory, or conditional use permitted in the zone in which it is located, and is not otherwise permitted in this chapter.
(b) Intent. There are lots, structures, and uses that exist and were lawful prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section which would be prohibited under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zones involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, nor extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone.
(c) Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, if the lot conforms to the regulation for the zone in which such lot is located. Exception to development requirements shall be obtained only through the variance procedures established in this chapter.
(d) Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity;
(2) Should such structure be partially or wholly destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and the remaining structure must be removed within twelve (12) months of the date of destruction;
Your Selections | Kenai, AK Page 21 of 189
The Kenai Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 3068-2019, passed June 19, 2019.
(3) Should such structure be partially destroyed by any means to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or less of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, a building permit may be issued to rebuild, restore, or repair the nonconforming structure within twelve (12) months of the date of damage. If a permit is not issued within that time period, the remaining structure must be removed within twelve (12) months of the date of destruction; provided however, that if reconstruction is delayed through litigation or other cause beyond the control of the owner, then the time of such delay shall not be considered when computing the twelve (12) month period for obtaining the building permit;
(4) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which it is located after it is moved.
(e) Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section, said use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No existing structures devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone in which it is located;
(2) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building which was arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building where such land was not so used at the effective date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this section;
(3) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Commission shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the zone than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter;
(4) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
(5) When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the zone in which it is located;
(6) Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal, or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(f) Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of the ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

(g) General Provisions.
(1) Signs and Display Devices. A nonconforming use of a structure, nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land, shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the ordinance codified in this section by attachment of additional signs to a building, or the placement of additional signs or display devices on the land outside of the building, or by the addition of other uses, if such additions are of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the zone involved except that this provision shall not be deemed to prohibit the replacement of one (1) sign with another of like size.
(2) Construction Begun Prior to Passage of the Ordinance Codified Herein. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination, and removal of an existing structure in connection with such construction, provided that actual construction work shall be diligently carried on until the completion of the building involved.
(3) Repairs and Maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or on any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current replacement value of the building, provided that the cubical content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section shall not be increased.

(e) Issuance of the Permit. Following approval by the Commission, the administrative official shall not issue the permit until the expiration of the fifteen (15) day appeal period contained in KMC 14.20.290. After approval by the Commission and before the issuance of the permit, the administrative official must determine that the applicant is current on all obligations (e.g., sales tax, property tax, lease payments, utility payments) to the City or has entered into an approved payment plan with the City on any obligations owed and the applicant is in compliance with the payment plan and (if the permit is for a use required to collect sales tax) must show a valid borough sales tax account. If a timely appeal is filed pursuant to KMC 14.20.290, the permit shall not be issued unless authorized by the Board of Adjustment.
(f) Yearly Reports. The permit holder shall submit a yearly report between October 1st and December 31st to the administrative official. Such report shall include a summary of the on-site activity.

A permittee must request a time extension in writing, and submit any supporting materials, within ninety (90) days of the date of the administrative officials written notice to the permittee that either the permit has lapsed under subsection (1) or that the permit has expired under subsection (2) by a date certain. If the administrative official does not issue a written notice concerning lapse or expiration, the permittee may request a time extension at any time within two (2) years of the date the permit was issued or the use ceased, whichever is later. A permittee may be granted time extensions not to exceed a total of two (2) years from the date of the Commissions grant of the first time extension. The Commission may, but is not required to, hold a public hearing prior to issuing a decision under this subsection.
(4) A permittee who disputes the administrative officials determination that the conditioned use has not been timely initiated or has ceased for a period of one (1) year or longer may appeal the officials determination to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with KMC 14.20.290. If the permittee has requested a stay under subsection (3), above, the time for appeal of the administrative officials determination of lapse or expiration shall not run until such time as the Commission has made a final decision on the request for a stay.

Home Occupations.
(a) Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to permit home occupations that are compatible with other permitted uses and with the residential character of a neighborhood, and that are clearly secondary or incidental to the residential use of the main building. In general, a home occupation is an accessory use so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal circumstances would not be aware of its existence other than for a sign as permitted in this chapter. Home occupations are permitted accessory uses only so long as all the development requirements listed in this section are observed.
(b) Uses Permitted. Subject to the development requirements of this section, home occupations include, but are not limited to, the following uses:
(1) Art Studio;
(2) Day care of no more than eight (8) children under the age twelve (12), including children related to the caregiver;
(3) Dressmaking;
(4) Sewing and tailoring;
(5) Barbers and beauticians; and
(6) Tutoring and musical instruction.
(c) Uses Prohibited. The following uses are prohibited as home occupations:

(d) Development Requirements.
(1) Not more than one (1) person outside the family shall be employed in the Home occupation.
(2) No more than thirty percent (30%) of the gross floor area of all buildings on the lot shall be used for the home occupation.
(3) The home occupation shall be carried on wholly within the principal building, or other buildings which are accessory thereto. Any building used for a home occupation shall be wholly enclosed.
(e) Permit Application.
(1) An application for a home occupation permit shall be filed in writing with the City Planning and Zoning Department and signed by the person requesting to operate the home occupation.
(2) If the administrative official finds the application meets the criteria of KMC 14.20.230 and recommends that the Commission should grant the permit, the official shall place consideration of the application on the consent agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Otherwise, the administrative official shall place consideration of the application as a regular new business item on the Commissions agenda. Applications listed on the consent agenda are considered routine and will be approved by one (1) motion. There will be no separate discussion of the application unless a member of the Commission so requests, in which case the item will be removed from the consent agenda and considered in its normal sequence on the agenda as part of the general orders.
(3) A finding by the Planning and Zoning Commission that an application does not meet the criteria of KMC 14.20.230 may be appealed in accordance with KMC 14.20.290.
(4) Notice of the consideration by the Commission of a home occupation permit application shall be published once at least two (2) days prior to the meeting in a paper of general circulation in the City of Kenai.
(f) Permits Nontransferable. A home occupation permit granted under this section is not transferable to another person or location.
(g) Exemption. No home occupation permit shall be required for:
(1) Activities or business which are carried on solely by use of phones, computers and mail or delivery services; or
(2) A State-approved relative home day care provider that provides care to no more than five (5) children (including the caregivers own children) under the age of twelve (12) of which no more than two (2) may be

under thirty (30) months of age and who are the caregivers grandchildren, great-grandchildren, sibling (only if living in a separate residence), niece or nephew (not a great niece or nephew), and which involve no outside sign, little or no increase in traffic, and with only occasional visits by members of the public to the home.
(h) Fire Code Inspections.
(1) Day care facilities shall be inspected by the Fire Marshal for compliance with the Fire Code (KMC 8.05) prior to approval of the permit. Thereafter, they shall be inspected every other year by the Fire Marshal. Failure to comply with the Fire Code (KMC 8.05) shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the facilities home occupation permit.
(2) Residences which are the subject of a home occupation permit application (other than day care facilities) may be required to be inspected by the Fire Marshal for compliance with the Fire Code (KMC 8.05) prior to approval of the permit, if the Fire Marshal determines it is necessary for public safety.

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
(1) Wind energy system means a system designed as a secondary, accessory use to existing principal uses and to existing buildings or facilities on a parcel, wherein the power generated is used primarily for consumption on the same parcel on which it is located. The system consists of a wind turbine and associated controls and may include a tower.
(2) Hub height means the distance measured from ground level to the center of the wind turbine hub.
(3) Total height means the distance measured from ground level to the highest point of any blade of the turbine.
(4) Wind turbine means a device which converts the kinetic energy of the wind into a rotational energy transmitted through a drive train to a generator and where the generated electricity can be connected directly to the load or feed.
(b) Lot and Zoning Requirements.
(1) Wind energy systems shall be allowed as secondary uses on lots that are a minimum of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. Any deviation from the lot size restriction may be approved through the issuance of a conditional use permit.

(c) Building Permit Application Requirements. Building permits shall be obtained for any wind energy system prior to construction and installation of the system. Building permit applications are reviewed under Title 4 of this code. The Planning Department shall review each permit application for compliance with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall provide documentation that the wind energy systems meet the design requirements of this section, or provide a conditional use permit approved by the City, as part of a building permit application.
(d) Development and Design Requirements.
(1) The requirements of this ordinance shall apply to all wind energy systems proposed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. Any deviation from the design requirements of this ordinance may be approved through the issuance of a conditional use permit.
(2) Building permit applications must include foundation plans designed for the installation location of the wind energy system and be stamped by an engineer licensed in the State of Alaska.
(3) All wind energy systems shall conform to the applicable uniform codes contained in Title 4 of the Kenai Municipal Code.
(4) The turbine to be constructed as a component of the wind energy system must be approved by the Small Wind Certification Program recognized by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) or any another accredited organization such as the Small Wind Certification Council, National Wind Technology Certification Center, or the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory or must be certified by a professional mechanical engineer licensed in the State of Alaska as a system that meets or exceeds industry safety standards for small wind energy systems.
(5) No wind energy system shall be installed until evidence has been given that the electrical utility company has been informed of, and approved, the customers intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator. Off-grid systems are exempt from this requirement.
(6) The permitted height shall be measured from the preexisting natural grade to the center of the turbine hub for horizontal and vertical systems. The height limitation for wind energy systems for secondary use or allowed by conditional use are as follows:

Your Selections | Kenai, AK Page 78 of 189
The Kenai Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 3068-2019, passed June 19, 2019.
(B) In the CG, ED, R, IL, and C Districts wind energy systems with total height not exceeding one hundred fifty feet (150') may be permitted; total height exceeding one hundred fifty feet (150') requires a conditional use permit.
(C) In the IH District wind energy system with total height not exceeding three hundred feet (300') may be permitted; total height exceeding three hundred feet (300') requires a conditional use permit.
(D) Total height limitation near the Kenai Municipal Airport. Regardless of zone, wind energy systems in aircraft-approach zones and within eight thousand feet (8,000') of the main runway shall be subject to height limitation on the basis of obstruction criteria as shown on the current FAA-approved Kenai Airport Master Plan drawings which are on file at Kenai City Hall. No conditional use may be granted that deviates from this requirement.
(7) Minimum blade ground clearance in all zoning districts is fifteen feet (15').
(8) All portions of any wind energy system, including guy wires and other anchors, shall comply with the setback standards for the principal use of the subject parcel as shown on the Development Requirements Table. No part of the wind energy system structure may extend into any access or utility easements.
(9) All portions of the wind energy system shall be a nonreflective, nonobtrusive color, subject to the approval of the City Planner. Typically, towers supporting systems shall not be finished in bright or vivid colors. The appearance of the turbines, towers, and any other related components shall be maintained throughout the life of the wind energy system pursuant to industry standards.
(10) No part of the wind energy system, including any supporting structures, shall be used for advertising of any kind. Wind energy systems shall not be artificially illuminated unless required by a state or federal agency.
(11) For roof-mounted wind energy systems, the owner must provide the City with certification from an engineer licensed in the State of Alaska that the roof is built to accommodate the system.
(12) Wind energy systems shall not be climbable up to fifteen feet (15') above the ground surface unless the system is secured in a fenced area with a minimum of a six-foot (6') high fence. This requirement does not apply to roof-mounted wind energy systems.
(13) The electrical collection system shall be installed underground. The electrical connection system may be placed overhead near substations or points of interconnection to the electric grid.
(14) Wind energy systems shall be designed, installed, and operated so that noise generated by the system shall not exceed fifty (50) decibels, as measured five feet (5') above ground level at the closest property line to the system; except, the sound level may be exceeded during short-term events including utility outages and/or severe wind storms.
(e) Maintenance. Wind energy systems shall be erected and maintained plumb, level, and true and shall be repaired, painted, and maintained in accordance with this ordinance, any manufacturers recommendations and instructions, and with industry standards for small wind energy systems.

(f) NuisancesRemoval.
(1) Any wind energy system that is not operated on a functional basis for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days is hereby declared unlawful, abandoned, and a public nuisance. In addition to other remedies provided by this chapter, the nuisance may be restrained, enjoined, or otherwise abated by the City.
(2) Demolition permits are required before a person removes a wind energy system. The permit shall require the entire system be removed (foundations to below natural grade, collection, connection, and transmission equipment) at the owners sole expense.
(g) EnforcementAbatement.
(1) Failure to maintain a wind energy system is a violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties of KMC 14.20.260.
(2) The City may issue an enforcement order under KM 14.20.260 for the repair or removal of any wind energy system that is not operated on a functional basis for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or where the wind energy system becomes an immediate hazard to the safety of person or property due to emergency circumstances. Emergency circumstances include natural or manmade disasters or accidents, or when the owner or other person responsible for the system refuses to remedy a hazard.
(3) Where the system presents no immediate hazard to health or safety, the owner shall repair or remove the system within thirty (30) days of receipt of notification of the enforcement order. Upon agreement in writing that the owner will comply with an enforcement order to repair or remove the system if allowed additional time, the City may grant an extension of time within which to abate the public nuisance, if the City determines that such an extension of time will not create or perpetuate a situation dangerous to life or property. If the wind energy system is not operational or is not removed after thirty (30) days from the date of notification of the enforcement order, or after the time of any extension provided, the City may remove the system at the owners expense.
(4) Where the City identifies an immediate health or safety hazard, and when the owner or other person responsible for the system is either not available to immediately remedy the hazard or refuses to remedy the hazard, the City may enter upon the property and disconnect, dismantle, or otherwise remove any wind energy system. The City shall attempt to notify any owner or other person responsible for the system of such action within forty-eight (48) hours. For purposes of this section, notice is effective the earlier of posting the notice on the property, personal delivery, or upon receipt, if sent by certified mail.
(5) The costs and expenses incurred by the City in abatement of any health and/or safety hazard or of any nuisance as defined in subsection (f) shall be chargeable to the owner, and levied and collected as property taxes are levied and collected and/or may be collected in a civil action by the City.
(6) A person aggrieved by an enforcement order may appeal that order under KMC 14.20.290.

14.25.040
Landscaping planPerformance criteria.
(a) Objectives for Landscaping Plan. An effective landscaping plan should utilize a variety of techniques for achieving the intent of this section. The appropriate placement or retention of vegetation in sufficient amounts will provide the best results. Perimeter, interior, street right-of-way, and parking lot landscaping must be included as components of the overall landscaping plan.
(b) Perimeter/Buffer Landscaping. Perimeter/buffer landscaping involves the land areas adjacent to the lot lines within the property boundary. This buffer landscaping serves to separate and minimize the impact between adjacent uses. Buffer landscaping may be desirable along the perimeter of the property to shield vehicular or building lights from adjacent structures and to provide a visual separation between pedestrians and vehicles and commercial and residential uses. Landscaping adjacent to residential zones shall have landscaping beds/buffers that meet all of the following minimum standards:
(1) Landscaping Beds. Minimum in width equal to the setback along all property lines, which adjoin residential zones, exclusive of driveways and other ingress and egress openings.
(2) Screening. Developers are encouraged to maintain natural screening when existing screening meets the intent of this chapter to shield between residential and commercial uses. When natural screening does not exist or is lost due to weather or disease, the following requirements must be used to meet the intent of this chapter:
(i) Combination of shrubbery and trees; and/or
(ii) Fencing. A six (6) foot high wood fence, masonry wall fence or other fence material of similar screening and structural character shall be required only to meet screening of the developed portion of the property. Sections of the fence must be no longer than twenty-five (25) feet. Sections must be offset a minimum of four (4) feet so as not to impede the movement of wildlife.
(3) Ground Cover. One hundred percent (100%) within three (3) years of planting and continuous maintenance so there will be no exposed soil. Flower beds may be considered ground cover.
(4) Trees and/or shrubs appropriate for the climate shall be included in the landscaping beds. All trees, shrubs or other vegetation in the required landscaping must be of a stock rated as hardy for the United States Department of Agriculture Climatic Zone 3. It is not the intent to require specific species; however, property owners are encouraged to understand local climate conditions. Property owners are discouraged from planting invasive species as defined by the Alaska Cooperative Extension Service. Property owners are encouraged to contact the Alaska Cooperative Extension Service for a list of plant species which are appropriate for Climate Zone 3. In all cases the materials shall be living and free of defects and of normal

health, height and spread as defined by the American Standard for Nursery Stock, ANSI Z60.1, latest available edition, American Nursery and Landscaping Association.
(c) Interior landscaping involves those areas of the property exclusive of the perimeter and parking lot areas. Interior landscaping is desirable to separate uses or activities within the overall development. Screening or visual enhancement landscaping is recommended to accent or complement buildings, to identify and highlight entrances to the site, and to provide for attractive driveways and streets within the site. Landscaping may include landscaping beds, trees, and shrubs. Small parking lots having less than forty (40) spaces may be exempted from the parking lot landscaping standards by the administration official.
(d) Parking Lot Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping involves the land areas adjacent to or within all parking lots and associated access drives. Parking lot landscaping serves to provide visual relief between vehicle parking areas and the remainder of the development. It also is desirable for the purpose of improving vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns.
(e) Street right-of-way landscaping softens the impact of land uses along street rights-of-way, but does not obscure land uses from sight. Landscaping beds must meet all of the following minimum standards; except where properties are adjacent to state of Alaska rights-of-way, the Administrative Officer may approve alternatives, which meet the intent of this section but protect landscaping from winter maintenance damage.
(1) Landscaping Beds. Minimum of ten (10) feet in width along the entire length of the property lines which adjoin street rights-of-way, exclusive of driveways and other ingress and egress openings;
(2) Ground Cover. One hundred percent (100%) ground cover of the landscaping bed within three (3) years of planting and continuous maintenance so there will be no exposed soil;
(3) Trees and/or shrubs appropriate for the climate shall be included in the landscaping beds.
(f) Review. The Administrative Official may consider plans for amendments if problems arise in carrying out the landscaping/site plan as originally approved.

Failure to do so will be cause for the City to accomplish the required work, and to collect damages therefor from the contractor or his surety.
(i) Unpaved Roads. In the case of unpaved roads, contractors shall place nothing but non-frost susceptible material in the area to excavate and six inches of good Type I gravel on the driving surface except where the existing road itself is not built according to these standards in which case the excavation shall be refilled as nearly as possible as found and in any event with compaction at 95% or better.

(i) Clean Up. As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock, and other debris resulting from such work. All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the contractor and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works. Immediately after completion of said work, the contractor shall, at his or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the Director of Public Works, said work may be done by the Director Public Works, and the cost thereof charged to the contractor, and the contractor shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder. The contractor shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all times maintained. The contractor shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings, or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its failure to so provide.

Rights prior to leasing.
The filing of an application for a lease shall give the applicant no right to lease or to the use of the land for which they have applied.

Where there is difficulty in obtaining a perfected application, details as to development plans, etc., or where the applicant fails to comply with directions or requests of the Planning and Zoning Commission, any such priority will be lost. If an application for the purchase of City-owned lands, previously authorized for sale by the Council, is received by the City prior to the Kenai Planning and Zoning Commission making an affirmative or negative recommendation to the Council regarding the lease application for the same property, the City may elect to sell the property in accordance with the provisions of the Code.
(b) The City Council shall normally consider a lease proposal only after approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. However, appeals of Planning and Zoning Commission disapproval may be made to the City Council. Completed lease applications must be presented to the City Council within thirty (30) days after approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(c) Where there are two (2) or more applications for the same lands for different uses, then if the Planning and Zoning Commission makes a finding that a subsequent application would result in use of the lands for a higher and better purpose with a greater benefit to the City of Kenai and the citizens thereof, then the lease may be issued to such applicant notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) in this section which provide for leasing on a first-come, first-served basis. Any applicant may appeal to the City Council from a finding or a refusal to find by the Planning and Zoning Commission by filing an appeal with the City Clerk within seven (7) days after the finding is made or refused by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(d) The decision whether or not to lease land rests in the sole discretion of the City Council.

Principles and policy of lease rates.
(a) A fair return to the General Fund is the policy of the City, unless deviation from that policy is in the best interest of the City as determined by the City Council. To ensure a fair return, all leases for a period in excess of five (5) years shall include a redetermination clause as of the fifth anniversary of the lease and every five (5) years thereafter, and all lands for lease shall be appraised prior to lease and again prior to redetermination. Lease rates:
(1) Shall be based on fair market value of the land, including an appropriate consideration of facilities and services available (public water, public sewer, storm sewers, and other public utilities) as determined by a qualified independent appraiser, considering the best use of the specified land; and
(2) Shall be eight percent (8%) of fair market value.
(b) For leases in existence prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the lease rate redetermination shall be as provided in the lease.
(c) The City Manager shall change the rent in a lease by giving the lessee written notice at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of the change.
(d) The fair market value of the premises shall be equal to the then fair market rate for similar commercial property in the City of Kenai, Alaska (the relevant area). City shall give notice to lessee of Citys estimation of the fair market value not later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-applicable five (5) year period, as evidenced and supported by the written opinion of an independent real estate appraiser certified under Alaska Statute 8.87, selected and paid for by the City, familiar with the relevant area (the first appraiser). If lessee disagrees with such estimate, it shall advise the City in writing thereof within thirty (30) days of lessees receipt of such estimate, as evidenced and supported by the written opinion of a real estate appraiser certified under Alaska Statute 8.87 (selected and paid for by lessee) familiar with the relevant area (the second appraiser). The parties shall promptly meet to attempt to resolve their differences between the first appraiser and the second appraiser concerning the fair market value of the premises. If City and lessee cannot agree upon such value then, with all deliberate speed, they shall direct the first appraiser and the second appraiser to expeditiously and mutually select a third real estate appraiser certified under Alaska Statute 8.87 (selected and paid for jointly by the parties) familiar with the relevant area (the third appraiser). Within thirty (30) days after the third appraiser has been appointed, the third appraiser shall decide which of the two (2) respective appraisals from the first appraiser and the second appraiser most closely reflects the fair market value of the premises. The fair market value of the premises shall irrebuttably be presumed to be the value contained in such appraisal selected by the third appraiser, and the rental shall be redetermined based on such value. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, rental shall continue to be paid at the then-applicable rate until any such new rental rate is established, and lessee and City shall promptly pay or refund, as the case may be, any variance in the rental, without interest thereon accruing to the extent to paid/refunded in a timely fashion.

(2) Land clearing, gravel fill, utility extensions and other improvements or amenities on or in direct connection with the premises, which the City agrees to construct as a condition of the lease, subject to City Council approval.

Lease utilization.
Leased lands shall be utilized for purposes within the scope of the application, the terms of the lease and in conformity with the ordinances of the City, and in substantial conformity with the Comprehensive Plan. Utilization or development for other than the allowed uses shall constitute a violation of the lease and subject the lease to cancellation at any time. Failure to substantially complete the development plan for the land shall constitute grounds for cancellation. (Ord. 2200-2006)

Sale procedure.
(a) The City Manager will obtain such an appraisal for a determination of the minimum price on the land.
(b) Where any party, hereinafter called applicant, requests that a tract or tracts of land be sold for which an appraisal will be required, which will require subdividing, platting, or surveying and staking, or which will require advertising or incurring any other expenditures by the City prior to sale.
(1) No actions in preparation for sale will be taken by the City until an agreement to purchase shall be properly executed and filed with the City Manager for the purchase of such land with payment of sufficient good faith deposit, which shall consist of cash or its equivalent deposited with the Finance Officer of the City of Kenai, as may be determined by the City Manager, to cover all expenses of the City and such agreement to purchase shall further contain the agreement by applicant to pay any additional costs if said good faith deposit is insufficient to pay all costs incurred by the City.
(2) If at any time during the process of preparing for sale, the applicant gives notice to the City Manager of withdrawal of the request for sale, the City Manager shall stop all procedures, shall pay expenses incurred prior to termination of sale procedures, and shall reimburse applicant for any good faith deposit advanced in excess of all expenses incurred. (However, if another party desires the sale to proceed, files an application for sale, executes and files an agreement to purchase, and advances sufficient funds therefor, then the prior applicant will be reimbursed for expenses charges which can be attributed to the subsequent applicant.)

The Kenai Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 3068-2019, passed June 19, 2019.
(3) If all actions necessary for preparation for sale have been accomplished, and if neither the applicant nor any other party purchases said land when first offered for sale after such request, then all expenses incurred in preparation for the sale will be paid from the good faith deposit, and the balance, if any, shall be returned to the applicant. If the sums advanced as good faith deposit are insufficient to pay all of the costs, the applicant will be billed for the balance due and normal collection procedures followed.
(4) If the land applied for is sold on public sale set in response to such request to anyone other than applicant, then on closing of the sale, the good faith deposit will be refunded in total to the applicant. The Citys expenses will be first deducted from the deposit of the successful bidder.
(5) If the land in question is sold to applicant, the good faith deposit advanced, after deducting the Citys expenses, will be applied on the payment due at closing.
(6) If the land in question is to be sold by sealed bid and the applicant has submitted a valid bid, but the applicant is not the high bidder, he or she may purchase the land by tendering the City a bid equal to the high bid within five (5) days of the bid opening. If the land sale is initiated in accordance with KMC 22.05.040(a), the applicant shall be defined as that party submitting the initial lease application.
(c) If the tract of land proposed to be sold is leased land, the lessee may request the sale of the land at not less than the fair market value. The current lessee obtains this right to request a sale only after, to the satisfaction of the City Manager, development has been completed as detailed in the development schedule which has been incorporated into the lease agreement. If there is no development schedule, the lessee may purchase the property if there have been substantial improvements as determined by the City Manager. The decision whether or not to sell the land to the lessee rests with the sold discretion of the City.
(d) If the tract of land proposed to be sold is not leased land, or is leased land without substantial improvements, then the tract of land may only be sold by outcry auction or by competitive sealed bids. If the tract is to be put up for such competitive auction or sealed bid sale, notice of sale and the manner in which the land is to be sold shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City once each week for two (2) successive weeks not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of sale; such notice shall also be posted in at least three (3) public places within the City at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of sale, and such other notice may be given by such other means as may be considered advisable by the City Manager.

(8) The amount of deposit to be submitted with each bid in order to cover the Citys expenses such as survey, appraisal, and reviews;
(9) Any other matters concerning the sale of which the City Manager believes the public should be informed.
(e) If no offers are submitted meeting the minimum acceptable offer (or appraised valuation), the City Manager may negotiate for sale of the tract or tracts of land with a modification of proposed terms or for less than the appraised valuation provided that no such negotiated sale for less than appraised value shall be binding upon the City unless the terms and price therein are approved by resolution of the City Council.
(f) Where a real estate agent furnishes a buyer for City land, the closing agent shall be authorized to pay the agent a real estate commission of five percent (5%) of the purchase price for the land or five percent (5%) of the appraised fair market value of the land, whichever is lower, under the following terms and conditions:
(1) The City Manager shall provide a non-exclusive listing of lands available for sale.
(2) No commission shall be paid to an agent where the agent is a party, or in privity with a party, to the sale.

(i) If a buyer desires to obtain a preliminary commitment for title insurance or title insurance to the land, then it shall be the responsibility of the buyer to obtain such commitment or insurance and to pay for the same.
(j) If the tract or tracts of land are sold under terms by which the City is to accept a note as a portion of the purchase price, the note and accompanying deed of trust must be prepared by an attorney, but must be approved by the City Attorney prior to closing.
(k) The note shall be placed for collection with a bank selected by the City Manager, which may be changed from time to time, and which shall be the bank in which City funds are deposited. The set-up fee to initiate collection may be negotiated as specified in KMC 22.05.100(l), and the buyer shall pay the annual collection fees for such bank collection.
(l) The City Manager is authorized to negotiate a division of the costs of sale listed in KMC 22.05.100(g) (h), (i), (j) and (k) to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the required costs being borne by the City, provided however that no costs of sale will be paid by the City where a sale is negotiated at a price below appraised fair market value.

The sale documents shall be subject to the same restrictions contained in the lease as the lease provides at the time of sale.
(2) Except for property sold by the City subsequent to foreclosure for delinquent taxes or assessments, prior to making a determination to accept a note and deed of trust from a prospective purchaser, the City Manager shall secure a preliminary commitment for title insurance and a review of the grantee index covering the party desiring to purchase the land from the title company in the local recording district, and no credit will be advanced on such sale if there are any delinquent liens or unpaid judgments found in the title company report until any such judgments or liens are paid and releases therefor have been filed.
(3) In the event of a credit sale, the down payment required shall be determined by the City Manager, but shall not be less than fifteen percent (15%) of the sales price.
(4) The City Manager is not authorized to accept terms for the sale of tax-foreclosed lands unless the down payment to be received thereunder, or other sums appropriated for the purpose, are sufficient to make immediate payment to the Kenai Peninsula Borough and the former record owner of the sums which are, or may become, due to them pursuant to the provisions of AS 29.
(b) If the City Manager determines that it is in the Citys interest to sell City lands, the sale shall be either a cash transaction or by a note secured by a deed of trust, subject to subsection (a) of this section, and by no other means. The note and deed of trust shall carry terms as follows:

(b) Because of the unique value of real property, the City need not acquire or lease real property by competitive bidding.
(c) Rights-of-way and easements may be accepted or issued by the City Manager after approval by the City Council for utility lines and services of all types and for necessary rights-of-way easements.
