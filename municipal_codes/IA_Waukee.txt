adopted by reference in this Code shall constitute a Municipal infraction
and is subject to civil penalties and subject to abatement to assure the
cessation of the violation and any other remedy ordered by the court in
accordance with § 374.22 Code of Iowa.
2. Any violation of this Code which would be a felony, an aggravated
misdemeanor or a serious misdemeanor under State law or a violation of a
simple misdemeanor under chapters 687-747 of the Code of Iowa shall not
constitute a Municipal infraction.

citation to a person who commits a Municipal infraction. The citation may
be served by personal service as provided in Iowa Code, rule of civil
procedure 1.305, by certified mail addressed to the defendant at the
defendant's last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by
publication in the manner as provided in Iowa Code, rule of civil
procedure 1.310 and subject to the conditions of Iowa Code, rule of civil
procedure 1.311. A copy of the citation shall be retained by the issuing
officer, and one copy shall be sent to the clerk of the District Court. The

issuing the citation.

judge or a District Judge in District Court if the total amount of
civil penalties does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in
the same manner as a small claim. The matter shall only be tried
before a judge in District Court if the total amount of civil
penalties assessed exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).
b. The City has the burden of proof that the Municipal infraction
occurred and that the defendant committed the infraction. The
proof shall be by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence.

charges and that the defendant understands the charges. The
defendant may question all witnesses who appear for the City and
produce evidence or witnesses on the defendant's behalf.
d. The defendant may be represented by counsel of the defendant's
own selection and at the defendant's own expense.
5
e. The defendant may answer by admitting or denying the infraction.
f. If a Municipal infraction is proven, the court shall enter a judgment
against the defendant. If the infraction is not proven, the court shall
dismiss it.
5. All penalties or forfeitures collected by the court for Municipal infractions
shall be remitted to the City in the same manner as fines and forfeitures
are remitted for criminal violations under Iowa Code, section 602.8106. If
the person named in the citation is served as provided in this Section and
fails, without good cause, to appear in response to the civil citation,
judgment shall be entered against the person cited.
6. A person against whom judgment is entered shall pay court costs and fees
as in small claims under Iowa Code, chapter 631. If the action is
dismissed, the City is liable for the court costs and court fees. Where the
action is disposed of without payment, or provisions for assessment, of
court costs, the clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the
City.
7. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this Section does not preclude the
City from issuing a criminal citation for the violation of the Waukee
Municipal Code.
8. Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the violator
constitutes a separate offense.
9. Any officer authorized by the City to enforce the Code of Ordinances may
issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal infraction.

CHAPTER 160
SITE AND BUILDING DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
160.01 Purpose and Scope 160.05 Lighting Standards – Definitions
160.02 Jurisdiction 160.06 Lighting Standards – Design Guidelines
160.03 Procedures 160.07 Site and Building Design Standards
160.04 Site Plan Requirements
160.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE. This chapter provides for the administration and
enforcement of site plans by establishing minimum standards for site and building design.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance and standards for development within the City
in order to guide development in a manner which is conducive to protecting the health, safety,
and general welfare of residents and property owners within the City. All development and
redevelopment of land or property within the City shall minimize the adverse effects placed upon
adjacent properties by maintaining or improving upon the aesthetic quality of the surrounding
area, and by providing adequate traffic safety, emergency access, water supply, sewage disposal,
management of storm water, erosion and sediment control. Site plan review and approval by City
Council shall be required of all principal structures other than individual single-family and
two-family residential dwellings in any zoning district.
160.02 JURISDICTION. No permit shall be issued for any lot or development requiring
the approval of a site plan except in conformity with this chapter. No development, except
where specified herein, may be created, substantially improved, converted, enlarged, or
otherwise altered without conforming to the provisions of this chapter, all applicable
provisions of the Code of Iowa, as amended, and all other applicable provisions of this Code
of Ordinances, as amended.
160.03 PROCEDURES. The property owner, developer, or other representing party on
behalf of a property owner interested in the development of land within the City shall adhere
to the procedures identified in this chapter, in accordance with all other applicable sections of
this Code of Ordinances.
1. Pre-Application Conference. It is recommended that prior to the submission
of any site plan application a meeting be scheduled with the administrative official
and other appropriate City department representatives. The purpose of this conference
shall be to discuss the feasibility of the proposal and to provide the owner with
information and guidance regarding applicable City ordinances, specifications,
standards, and procedures, before the owner enters into binding commitments or
incurs substantial expenses. In addition, the administrative official will identify a
development review schedule best suited to accommodate the applicant’s time
schedule and the City’s ability to effectively review the proposal.
2. Development Review. In order to properly review a site plan proposal, the
applicant shall provide the City with information determined to be applicable to the
project by the administrative official. Once the proposal has provided all of the
necessary information meeting the requirements of all applicable City ordinances, the
proposal shall be brought before the Planning and Zoning Commission in order to
receive a recommendation before being presented to the City Council. Action of the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall be approval, approval
subject to conditions, denial, or table for further review. Action of the Council shall
be approval, denial, or table for further review. A site plan may be presented for
consideration by the City Council in the event of a recommendation of denial by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. In the event of denial of a site plan by the City
Council, the applicant would be required to resubmit and begin the review process
anew to have another proposal considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council. Re-submittal of a site plan shall be subject to all applicable costs
associated with review of the documentation. Development review shall exist as a
measurement determined by the City to meet the objectives outlined by the Waukee
Comprehensive Plan.
3. Validity of Approval. A site plan shall become effective upon certification of
approval by the City Council. The City Council approval of any site plan required by
this chapter shall remain valid for one year, allowing one one-year extension with
approval of City Council upon recommendation of the Commission after the date of
approval, after which time the site plan shall be deemed null and void if the
development has not been established or actual construction commenced. For the
purpose of this chapter, “actual construction” means that the permanent placement of
construction materials has started and is proceeding without undue delay. Preparation
of plans, securing financial arrangements, issuance of building permits, letting of
contracts, grading of property, or stockpiling of materials on the site do not constitute
actual construction. At the time of site plan approval, the City Council may grant an
exemption on the time construction must begin after their approval is given for a
utility service structure.
4. Amendment. Any site plan may be amended in accordance with the standards
and procedures established herein, including payment of fees, provided that the
administrative official may waive such procedures for those minor changes hereinafter
listed. Such minor changes shall not be made unless the prior written approval for
such changes is obtained from the administrative official. No fees shall be required
for such minor changes. Minor changes include: (i) moving building walls within the
confines of the smallest rectangle that would have enclosed each original approved
building; (ii) relocation of building entrances or exits and shortening of building
canopies; (iii) changing to a more restrictive commercial or industrial use, provided
the number of off-street parking spaces meets the requirement of the Waukee zoning
ordinance (this does not apply to residential uses); (iv) changing angle of parking or
aisle, provided there is no reduction in the amount of off-street parking as originally
approved; (v) substituting plant species, provided a landscape architect, engineer or
architect certifies the substituted species is similar in nature and screening effect.
5. Existing Development. Any improvement or maintenance to any structure or
site feature must not cause the site or building to become non-compliant with the
regulations set forth in this chapter. If the site or building is already non-compliant,
the change to the building or site proposed by the owner must not cause them to
become more non-compliant. In such instances, improvements shall be completed in a
manner which makes the building, site, or related items more compliant with the
current provisions of this chapter than they were previous to the improvements. Any
improvement proposed to modify the size of a building, lot, parking area, etc. shall be
submitted for review by the City. If the proposed improvement modifies the size of a
building or lot by less than 25 percent, it shall be submitted for review by City staff
and approved or disapproved by City staff. The administrative official shall have the
authority to require such a project be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council if they feel such review is warranted. If the proposed
change is in excess of 25 percent, it shall be submitted for full review and approval or
disapproval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
6. Nonconforming Uses. Any site or building use permitted under a previous
zoning district’s regulation shall conform to the regulations of this chapter under the
current site and building design provisions determined to be most applicable to the
nonconforming use by the administrative official.
7. Violation and Penalty. Any person, firm, partnership, association or
corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the
violation or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or
remedy such violation or defects within a reasonable time; and when not otherwise
specified, each 30 days that prohibitive conditions are maintained shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition, the City of Waukee may proceed in law or in equity to
restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of said building,
structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct of business, or use in or about
said premises.

area from a public street right-of-way or an adjacent zoning district
different from the site. Wood privacy fence or chain link fencing
shall not be allowed for screening outdoor storage areas.
D. Exterior Color. The use of bright, bold, or vibrant colors shall be
consistent with the City’s vision for the surrounding area and used primarily
in accent materials or similar applications that are not determined to conflict
with neighboring properties or circumvent the Sign Ordinance. This shall not
restrict the use of such colors on multiple material applications if deemed to
align with the City’s vision or plan for an area.
E. Conformance with City’s Intent for Design. All buildings, structures,
and sites shall be designed in conformance with the City’s intent for the level
of character and design desired for certain projects as illustrated in the
adopted Architectural Design Example Book or Downtown Design
Guidelines as applicable to the zoning district. It is not expected that all
projects will be identical to the examples provided in the book, but shall
provide for the same level of detail, interest, durability in materials, and
scaling methods identified in the book. Where a question of interpretation
arises between a proposed project in relation to the examples provided in the
book, the administrative official shall provide for the determined
interpretation.

Districts. The regulations specified under this district shall apply to townhome, row
dwelling, and multi-family dwellings within an R-3or R-4 District.
A. All townhome, row, and multi-family dwellings proposed within the
same development shall have a unified architectural theme. Sites where four
or more buildings are proposed shall provide slight differentiation in design
amongst buildings of the same size or number of units to provide for a higher
level of architectural design for the site as a whole.
B. Each townhome or row dwelling façade shall be divided into a
maximum of 20-foot linear sections. Multi-family façades shall be divided
into a maximum of 40-foot linear sections. This requirement may be
accomplished by the use of:
(1) Window bays.
(2) Articulation in roof lines through the use of dormers or
gables.
(3) Variation in building offsets.
(4) The division of continuous materials.
(5) The use of architectural accents such as chimneys, balconies,
pediments, columns, cornice lines, or moldings.
C. Each building shall be designed with same level of architectural style
on all sides. For townhomes and row dwellings, a minimum of 20% of the
front façade shall be comprised of brick and/or stone. For multi-family
developments, a minimum of 35% of the total area of building elevations shall
be comprised of brick and/or stone. In calculating wall surfaces, windows
and doors shall not be considered within the calculation.
D. Exterior building materials along elevations which adjoin a public or
private street shall employ a variety of textures and colors as well as window
and door details.
E. Variation in building materials used shall take place with the change
in building plane. However, the change in materials shall keep with the
chosen architectural theme.
F. Any garage door proposed within a townhome, row dwelling, or
multi-family structure shall be integrated into the façade so as not to become a
prominent element of the dwelling. Garages proposed within a townhome,
row dwelling or multi-family development shall be integrated into the design
of the overall building and shall incorporate architectural details. This shall
be accomplished with the use of windows, decorative hardware, recessed
garage doors, roof canopies, trellises, columns, trim details, offsets between
garages of adjacent units and paired, single-car garage doors.
G. Detached garages shall be designed with materials consistent with
those used on the principal buildings within the development. Detached
garages shall not be located along a public street frontage. Detached garaged
shall be discouraged within townhome developments.

Office Districts. The regulations specified under this district will apply specifically to
the C-1, C-1B, and C-4 Districts.
A. Buildings constructed in a Community Commercial or Office District
shall be designed to sustain interest throughout the entirety of the building’s
exterior and reduce the appearance of a box or cube.
B. Individual buildings within a planned retail center, office park, or
similar environment shall be designed with a compatible architectural style or
theme.
C. In order to ensure the longevity and future usability of retail buildings
in excess of 50,000 square feet (e.g., big box retailer, anchor of a strip mall,
etc.) additional articulation and structural offsets shall be provided to ensure
future reuse of the structure by smaller user groups. This shall be
accomplished by visually separating the building into masses conducive to
such reuse.
D. Buildings within the Community Commercial or Office District shall
incorporate a blend of various Primary Materials including: (i) aluminum
composite materials; (ii) brick; (iii) cast stone; (iv) cultured stone; (v) glass;
(vi) plate cladding system; and (vii) precast concrete panels. The primary

The City Council, after receiving a favorable recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, may consider an alternative material not
specifically listed above if the overall design is determined to provide a
unique use of the material and meets the intent of this section in creating an
appearance of permanency and sustained interest throughout the entirety of
the building.
E. Common ribbed metal panels shall not be permitted as an allowed
principle or secondary material within the Community Commercial and
Office Districts.
F. Principal buildings shall be oriented and located in a manner which
allows for shared access drives and/or parking with adjacent principal
buildings.
G. Automobile and pedestrian corridors should be clearly defined
throughout the proposed site. This should be accomplished through the use
of:
(1) Landscaped medians and islands within proposed parking
areas.
(2) Defined pedestrian corridors provided through or around
parking areas between principal buildings.
(3) Brick, stone, or similar pavement accents at critical
pedestrian and automobile crossings.
(4) Automobile and pedestrian lighting located along primary
corridors within the site.
7. Architectural and Site Design Characteristics – Downtown Village District.
The regulations specified under this district will apply specifically to the C-2 District
and take precedence over any conflicting provisions of this chapter. All buildings and
structures within the Downtown Village District shall be designed, oriented, and
planned consistent with the adopted Downtown Design Guidelines.

all required landscape plantings:
1. Interference with Site Drainage. Landscape plantings shall not be placed
where they interfere with site drainage.
2. Plantings Shown on Approved Site Plan. Landscape plantings shall not be
placed in any public utility easement unless specifically permitted on the approved
site plan.
3. Interference with Public Utilities. Plantings shall not be placed where they
may interfere with maintenance of sanitary and storm structures, fire hydrants, or
water valves, or any other public utility.
4. Approved Plantings. Landscape plantings shall not be placed in any public
street right-of-way unless previously approved by the City Council and shall not be
counted toward fulfillment of the minimum site requirements set forth below.
5. Vision Clearance Triangle. Vision clearance triangle shall be maintained at
all times.
6. Restoration with Sod. All disturbed land shall be restored with sod, unless
specifically approved otherwise. In residential districts or uses, the entire front yard,
side yard, and rear yard to the building setback line shall be sodded. In all cases, the
adjacent right-of-way shall be sodded.
7. Survey of Larger Trees. A survey of trees larger than six-inch caliper in
diameter is required for sites with such existing trees. The tree inventory shall include
species, size, and a location map. Such plan shall be included in the initial
development submittal.
8. Existing Landscaping Identified and Protected. All existing landscaping that
is not to be removed pursuant to the grading, landscape or site plan, shall be clearly
identified and, prior to issuance of a permit, shall be protected by fencing located
around the drip line of the tree, maximizing the protection of the root zone area. The
administrative official may waive this requirement if the landscaping to be saved is
not located in the immediate area where construction is to occur.
9. Preservation of Existing Landscaping. Whenever practical, existing
landscaping shall be preserved and incorporated into the overall design and layout of
the site.
10. Quantity of Trees Required. In sites where landscaping existed and was
retained during development, the minimum quantity of trees required may be reduced
by the total amount of caliper saved in the case of a deciduous tree or the total height
in the case of an evergreen tree. No more than 50 percent of required plants may be
waived in this manner.
11. Plantings Prohibited. Plant species to be used for landscaping shall be
acceptable to the City if they are not considered a nuisance or undesirable species
such as trees with thorns, cottonwood or cotton bearing poplars, elm trees prone to
Dutch Elm Disease and box elder.
161.03 MINIMUM OPEN SPACE REQUIRED. It is recognized that the extensive use
and excessive congestion of land may become hazardous to the general health and welfare of
the community. Therefore, the intent of this chapter shall be to require not less than that open
space that is necessary to preserve the basic qualities and beauty of nature. Open space shall
be provided for each site in each district in accordance with the table below. Values are in
percentage of total site unless specified herein:
R-3 R-3A R-6 C-1 C-1A C-1B C-2 C-4 M-1 M-1A M-2
20 20 250 square
feet per lot
devoted to
recreational
area
20 20 20 None 25 15 15 10
The calculation of required open space shall not include sidewalks in the minimum required
open space.
161.04 MINIMUM PLANTING REQUIREMENTS. The provisions below represent the
minimum standards required for compliance of this chapter. These regulations are not
intended to suppress creative design concepts or the use of variety in the landscape plan.
1. Minimum Size. The minimum size for required plantings, other than those in
required buffers, shall be as follows:
A. Deciduous overstory trees shall be a minimum of 8 feet in height.
B. Evergreen overstory trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height.
C. Deciduous ornamental trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height.
2. Minimum Quantity. The minimum number of plantings per site shall be as
follows:
A. A minimum of 50 percent of all required trees shall be overstory
shade trees.
B. For all uses except single-family attached and detached residential
dwellings, a minimum of 25 percent of all required trees shall be evergreen
trees.
3. Minimum Planting Quantities:
R-1, R-2, R-4, R-6 R-3, R-3A, Commercial, Industrial
2 trees per dwelling unit 1 tree per 1,000 square feet of required open space;
1 shrub per 1,000 square feet of required open space
4. Values expressed in the table above are in addition to plantings required in
buffers and screening.
161.05 OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS. All of the following requirements shall apply
to off-street parking areas except for single-family attached and detached parking in driveways
as follows:
1. All rows of parking spaces shall be provided a terminal landscaped island,
with a minimum width of ten feet and a minimum length of 17 feet for single parking
rows and 34 feet for dual parking rows, to protect parked vehicles, provide visibility,
confine moving traffic to driveways, and provide space for landscaping.
2. There shall be provided within each row of parking spaces, landscaped
islands, with a minimum width of 6 feet and a minimum length of 17 feet for single
parking rows and 34 feet for dual parking rows, located so as to prevent more than 15
vehicles from being parked side by side in an abutting configuration.
3. All landscaped islands required in subsections 1 and 2 of this section shall be
planted with at least one ornamental or one deciduous overstory tree. A minimum of
50 percent of the landscaped islands shall be provided with a deciduous overstory tree.
The entire landscaped island area shall be covered with plant materials, lawn, or
mulches.
4. The setback between the parking area and the public right-of-way shall be
landscaped with a minimum of one overstory deciduous tree per 40 linear feet of
frontage. The frontage calculation shall be exclusive of the driveways. The plantings
may be planted individually or in clusters. This requirement shall be included in the
minimum number of trees required for the site and is not in addition to.
5. To encourage the use of alternative design practices and green infrastructure,
the City Council upon a recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
may accept alternative landscape covers and/or designs for parking lot islands, if
designed appropriately and in concert with surrounding development.
161.06 BUFFERS AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS. It is recognized that the
transition from one district to another district of contrasting and conflicting uses is across a
line in theory, not in existence. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to require the actual
provision of a physical barrier so as to reduce possible harmful or detrimental influence one
zoning district’s use may have to an abutting and contrasting or conflicting zoning district’s
use. The following are conditions for requiring a buffer:
1. Any lot for residential use, having both its front and rear lot lines abutting a
public thoroughfare (a double frontage lot) shall require 25 feet adjoining the
thoroughfare from which no access is planned or permitted.
2. Buffers shall be provided in accordance with the following table. Values are
in feet:
AR, R-1,
R-2
R-3, R-3A,
R-6
R-4 Commercial
Except for
C-2
Industrial
AR, R-1,

Commercial,
except for
C-2
30 30 30 -- 40
Industrial 40 40 40 40 --
3. The more intense use shall provide the buffer required above. In an instance
where adjacent property is down zoned, thereby requiring additional buffer, the newly
zoned property shall provide the additional required buffer.
4. The following shall be the minimum requirement. All buffers shall provide
the plantings as prescribed below.
Buffer Material Requirements (Per 50 Linear Feet of Buffer)
25 feet 1 overstory 2 evergreen 2 ornamental
30 feet 2 overstory 3 evergreen 2 ornamental
40 feet 2 overstory 4 evergreen 3 ornamental
5. Whenever practical, existing trees and shrubs should be preserved and
incorporated into the overall design of the buffer and can be included to meet the total
number of required trees. A continuous earthen berm, minimum of three feet in
height, shall be provided in addition to the required plantings.
6. Whenever practical, existing trees and shrubs should be preserved and
incorporated into the overall design of the buffer and can be included to meet the total
number of required trees. A continuous earthen berm, minimum of three feet in
height, shall be provided in addition to the required plantings.
7. In addition to the required permanent landscape buffer, the City Council may
require a fence or a heavily landscaped earth berm to provide additional screening.
Such fence shall be constructed of substantial support elements, including, but not
limited to, brick, poured concrete, and stone. Steel posts shall not be considered
appropriate.
8. Required yards shall be measured from the lot lines as prescribed in this
chapter. Buffer may be included in yards required by this chapter. No building,
parking, or structures shall be permitted within any buffer, unless authorized by the
City Council.
9. In a residential subdivision, the developer of the subdivision shall be required
to install the buffer improvements as required by this section. The owner of the
adjacent private property shall maintain the buffer in perpetuity.
10. In a situation that has landscape requirements other than those stated in the
buffering requirements, the buffer requirements shall be in addition to any other
required landscaping.
11. The need to establish the buffer as an easement shall be reviewed and
identified during the development review process. Easements shall generally be
required between different zoning districts and for buffering requirements of
residential districts. It shall be assumed that the buffer will be established by an
easement unless noted otherwise during the development review process and
approved by the City Council. Buffer easements shall be recorded with the County at
the time of establishment, prior to, or concurrent with the recording of a final plat or
the final approval of a site plan.
12. For single-family residential subdivisions, the landscape buffer shall be
submitted for review and approval as a public improvement, at the same time as the
preliminary plat. For any type of development that requires a site plan review, the
buffer plans shall be submitted as a part of the site plan submittal.
161.07 REDUCTION IN REQUIRED BUFFER. The City Council may, at its
discretion, reduce the required buffer under the following conditions:
1. In those areas where the boundary line abuts permanent natural features that
function as a buffer, including, but not limited to, ponds, severe grades, or mature
woodlands, requirements for a buffer area for that portion of the boundary may be
reduced by the City Council in the proportions that the permanent natural features
fulfill the buffer requirements.
2. In those areas where the property abuts an undeveloped property that is shown
on the adopted land use plan as the same or a more intensive use.
3. The abutting property has provided a portion or the entire required buffer.
4. On lots that can present evidence that the above buffer provisions would
render the property unbuildable, the City Council may grant a waiver of the buffer
requirements and permit a fence of not less than six feet in height. Provisions for
landscaping to soften the visual appearance of the fence and provide additional
buffering may be required and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
5. In those areas that abut a public park, the buffer area for that portion of the
boundary may be reduced to 50 percent of the requirement.

zoning regulations but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions
of these zoning regulations. It is the intent of these zoning regulations to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such
uses are declared by these zoning regulations to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved.
1. Nonconformities In Any Residential District.
A. Nonconforming Use of Land. The lawful use of land upon which no
building or structure is erected or constructed, which becomes nonconforming
under the terms of these zoning regulations as adopted or amended, may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
(1) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of these zoning regulations.
(2) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied
by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these
zoning regulations.
(3) If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason
for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such
land is located.
B. Nonconforming Use of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of
a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of these zoning regulations, which would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of these zoning regulations, the use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not
permitted by these zoning regulations in the district in which it is
located, except when required by law, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the use is
changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is
located.
(2) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for
such use at the time of adoption or amendment of these zoning
regulations. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land
outside such building.
(3) If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of
a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use within the
same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
(4) In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure (or
structure and land in combination) is discontinued or abandoned for a
period of six months, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to
the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. Where
nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate
the nonconforming status of the land.
(5) Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by these
zoning regulations which is destroyed by any means to an extent of
60 percent or more of its assessed value cost at the time of
destruction, exclusive of the foundations, shall not be reconstructed
and used as before such happening. If the structure is less than 60
percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed and
used as before, provided it is done within six months of such
happening, and is built of like or similar materials.
C. Nonconforming Structures. Where a structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of these zoning regulations, which could not
be built under the terms of these zoning regulations by reason of restrictions
on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that
increases its nonconformity.
(2) Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent
of 60 percent or more of its assessed value at time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
these zoning regulations.
2. Nonconformities In Any District Other Than Residential.
A. Nonconforming Use of Land. The regulations described in
subsection 1(A) of this section shall also apply to this subsection.
B. Nonconforming Use of Structures. The regulations described in
subsection 1(B) of this section shall also apply to this subsection, with the
following exception: Any structure in any district other than a residential
district devoted to a use made nonconforming by these zoning regulations
may be structurally altered or enlarged in conformity with the lot area, lot
coverage, frontage, yard, height, and parking requirements of the district in
which located, provided such construction is limited to buildings on land
owned, of record, by the owner of the land devoted to the nonconforming use
prior to the effective date hereof. Such structural alteration or enlargement
shall not authorize the substitution of a nonconforming use that is less
restrictive than the one to which the structure was devoted at the time of
adoption of these zoning regulations.
C. Nonconforming Structures. The regulations described in subsection
1(C) of this section shall also apply to this subsection.
3. Required Repairs and Unauthorized Nonconformities.
A. Nothing in these zoning regulations shall be deemed to prevent the
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
B. Any use of land, use of structure, or structure, in existence at the time
of adoption of these zoning regulations, which was not an authorized
nonconformity under any previous zoning ordinance or similar regulations,
shall not be authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant to these
zoning regulations or amendments thereto.
165.04 CONFORMANCE REQUIRED. Except as hereinafter specified, no building,
sign, or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered,
nor shall any building or land be used, which does not comply with all of the district
regulations established by these zoning regulations for the district in which the building or
land is located.
165.05 STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED. Except as permitted in Section 165.19 of
this chapter, no lot shall contain any building used in whole or in part for single-family or twofamily
residence purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 40 feet on at least one public street.
An exclusive unobstructed ingress/egress easement of access or right-of-way of at least 24 feet
wide to a public street may be used to satisfy this requirement in unique circumstances as
approved by the Council upon recommendation of the Commission.
165.06 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
1. Occupancy of Yard Area. Accessory buildings, regardless of height, which
are constructed above the normal ground surface in any yard area shall not occupy
more than 30 percent of the yard area in which it is located, except in an R-6 District;
however, this regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the construction of a 440
square foot garage. The 30 percent maximum shall include the total of all accessory
buildings and structures.
2. Location.
A. No accessory building shall be erected in any front yard.
B. Accessory buildings must be erected separately from, and a minimum

approved plat.
C. In no case shall any eaves or overhang extend closer than 12 inches to
a rear or side yard line or an easement line.
4. Height. No accessory building shall exceed 14 feet in height. Height is
measured as the vertical distance from the average finished grade at the building line
to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof, or to the deck line of a mansard roof,
or to the average height of the highest gable of a pitch or hip roof.
5. Design Characteristics.
A. In all cases, accessory buildings shall be constructed of materials
similar to the principal structure and in character with the surrounding built
environment as determined by the administrative official.
B. If any unenclosed balcony or unenclosed porch, including any deck,
shall be constructed within six feet from any accessory building, the adjacent
wall of said accessory building shall be not less than a two-hour fire wall. No
unenclosed balcony or unenclosed porch or deck shall be constructed closer
than three feet to any accessory building.
6. Principal Building Relationship.
A. Any building so connected to the principal building shall be
considered a part of the said principal building and must meet the space
requirements thereof.
B. No accessory building shall be constructed upon a lot until the
construction of the principal building has been actually commenced, and no
accessory building shall be used unless the administrative official has issued a
certificate of occupancy for the principal building.

1981, the front yard regulation shall apply to each street side of the corner lot. (See Section
165.20 of this chapter for illustrations.)
165.09 YARDS AND OPEN SPACE.
1. Front Yard. In all residential districts, there shall be a minimum front yard required as
stated in the bulk regulations for that particular district; provided, however, where lots
comprising 30 percent or more of the frontage within 200 feet of either side lot line are
developed with buildings at a greater or lesser setback, the front yard requirement shall be the
average of these building setbacks and the minimum front yard required for the undeveloped
lots. In computing the average setback, buildings located on reverse corner lots or entirely on
the rear half of lots shall not be counted. The required front yard as computed herein need not
exceed 50 feet in any case. (See Section 165.20 of this chapter for illustrations.)
2. Reduction of Required Yard or Open Space Prohibited. No yard or lot existing at the
time of the effective date hereof shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum
required by these zoning regulations. No part of a yard or other open space, or off-street
parking or loading space provided about any building, structure, or use for the purpose of
complying with the provisions of these zoning regulations, shall be included as part of a yard,
open space, or off-street parking or loading space required under these zoning regulations for
another building, structure, or use.
165.10 PERMITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED. Nothing herein contained shall require any
change in the overall layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any building, or part
thereof, for which approvals and required permits have been granted before the enactment of
these zoning regulations, the construction of which in conformance with such plans shall have
been started prior to the effective date hereof and completion thereof carried on in a normal
manner and not discontinued for reasons other than those beyond the builder’s control.
165.11 ZONING DISTRICTS DIVIDING PROPERTY. Where one parcel of property
is divided into two or more portions by reason of different zoning district classifications, each
of these portions shall be used independently of the other in its respective zoning
classification, and for the purpose of applying the regulations of these zoning regulations, each
portion shall be considered as if in separate and different ownership.
165.12 HOME OCCUPATIONS. Subject to the limitations of this section, any home
occupation that is customarily incidental to the principal use of a building as a dwelling shall
be permitted in any dwelling unit. Any question of whether a particular use is permitted as a
home occupation, as provided herein, shall be determined by the administrative official
pursuant to the provisions of these zoning regulations. The regulations of this section are
designed to protect and maintain the residential character of established neighborhoods while
recognizing that certain professional and limited business activities have traditionally been
carried on in the home. This section recognizes that, when properly limited and regulated,
such activities can take place in a residential structure without changing the character of either
the neighborhood or the structure.
1. Use Limitations. In addition to all of the use limitations applicable to the district in
which it is located, no home occupation shall be permitted unless it complies with the
following restrictions:
A. Not more than one person who is not a resident on the premises shall be employed or
independently contracted to conduct work on the premises unless specifically permitted
elsewhere in this chapter.
B. No more than 50 percent, including storage area, of no more than one floor of the
dwelling unit, shall be devoted to the home occupation.

magnetic interference, vibration, heat, glare, or other nuisance outside the residence shall be
permitted.
I. No home occupation shall be permitted which is noxious, offensive, or hazardous by
reason of vehicular traffic, generation or emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust or other
particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare, refuse, radiation, or other harmful,
objectionable emissions.
2. Home Occupations Permitted. Customary home occupations include, but are not
limited to, the following list of occupations; provided, however, each such home occupation
shall be subject to the use limitations set out in subsection 1 of this section.
A. Providing instruction to not more than four students at a time. For private swim
lessons, the following provisions shall be observed:
(1) Hours of operation shall be limited to 8:00 a.m. through 5:00

operating in a lawful place and manner; provided, however, such outside areas shall be
screened from public view.
165.13 VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS. On a corner lot, nothing shall be erected,
placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision between a
height of two and one-half and 10 feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in
the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line joining points along said
street lines 25 feet from the point of intersection of right-of-way lines.
165.14 FENCES, WALLS AND HEDGES.
1. Specifications. Notwithstanding other provisions of these zoning regulations, fences,
walls, and hedges may be permitted in any required yard, or along the edge of any yard;
provided, no fence, wall, or hedge shall exceed four feet in height within the building setback
area adjacent to any public right-of-way. Six-foot-high fences are allowed only outside front
yard building setback areas. (A “front” yard may be along the side or the rear of a home, if
adjacent to the street.) Fences, walls, and hedges in any district other than M-1, M-1A and M2
districts not exceeding six feet in height are permitted within limits of side and rear yards.
In M-1, M-1A and M-2 districts, fences and walls shall not exceed a height of eight feet.
2. Attractiveness of Face of Fence. For all new fences, the face of the fence shall be
equally attractive on both sides. However, if one side of the fence is considered less attractive
because of structural members, etc., the less desirable side of the fence shall be directed
toward the developing property or away from the public right-of-way.
3. Double Frontage Lots. In the case of double frontage lots, the minimum setback on
the secondary front yard shall not be less than 10 feet provided no landscaping buffer exists
for a fence up to six feet in height. In the case that a landscape buffer exists, the minimum
setback shall not be less than the width of the landscape buffer easement. with an arterial or
collector street forming the rear property line for a fence up to six feet in height. Corner Lots.
In the case of fences on corner lots, fences not exceeding six feet in height are permitted in the
secondary front yard provided a minmum setback of 20 feet from the property line is
maintained.
165.15 BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS. Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision approved by the City Council and on record in the office of the County
Recorder shows a building line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front
yard or side street yard line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such
frontage in place of any other yard line required in these zoning regulations unless
specific yard requirements in these zoning regulations require a greater setback.
Building lines shall be measured at the foundation.
165.16 WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow and encourage the safe, effective, and
efficient use of small wind energy systems; identify locations in areas of the City which would
be least adversely impacted by the visual, aesthetic, and safety implications of their siting; and
enhance the ability of the providers of wind energy services to provide such services to the
community quickly, efficiently, and effectively.

conversion system shall be installed in any location along the major axis of an existing
microwave communications link where its operation is likely to produce electromagnetic
interference in the link’s operation.
J. Interconnection. The wind energy conversion system, if interconnected to a utility
system, shall meet the requirements for interconnection and operation as set forth by the utility
and the Iowa Utilities Board.
K. Wind Access Easements. The enactment of this section does not constitute the
granting of an easement by the City. The owner/operator shall provide covenants, easements,
or similar documentation to assure sufficient wind to operate the wind energy conversion
system unless adequate accessibility to the wind is provided by the site.
L. Shadow Flicker. A shadow flicker model demonstrates that shadow flicker shall not
fall on, or in, any existing residential structure. Shadow flicker expected to fall on a roadway
or a portion of a residentially zoned parcel may be acceptable if the flicker does not exceed 30
hours per year; and the flicker will fall more than 100 feet from an existing residence; or the
traffic volumes are less than 500 vehicles on the roadway. The shadow flicker model shall:
(1) Map and describe within a 1,000-foot radius of the proposed
dispersed wind energy system the topography, existing residences and
location of their windows, locations of other structures, wind speeds
and directions, existing vegetation and roadways. The model shall
represent the most probable scenarios of wind constancy, sunshine
constancy, and wind directions and speed.
(2) Calculate the locations of shadow flicker caused by the
proposed project and the expected durations of the flicker at these
locations, calculate the total number of hours per year of flicker at all
locations.
(3) Identify problem areas where shadow flicker will interfere
with existing or future residences and roadways and describe
proposed mitigation measures, including (but not limited to) a change
in siting of the wind energy conversion system, a change in the
operation of the wind energy conversion system, or grading or
landscaping mitigation measures.
M. Appearance. The property owner of any wind energy system shall maintain such
system in a safe and attractive manner, including replacement of defective parts, painting,
cleaning, and other acts that may be required for the maintenance and upkeep of the function
and appearance of such a system. The owner shall maintain the ground upon which the
system is located in an orderly manner, such that is free of debris, tall grass and weeds, and
any structures remain quality in appearance.
N. Climbing Apparatus. The tower must be designed to prevent climbing within the first
10 feet.
8. Application Process. All applicants who wish to locate a wind energy system must
submit to the city’s development services department a plan including the following
information:

B. Location and full dimensions of all buildings existing on the property where the
system is located, including exterior dimensions, height of buildings, and all uses on the
property.
C. Location and distances of all buildings within 200 feet of the property and uses on
property.
D. Location and dimensions of any other natural or manmade features within 200 feet of
the property such as trees, ridges, highways, streets, bridges, and underpasses.
E. Location of all easements upon the property where the system is to be located.
F. Proposed location of tower, including height and setbacks from property lines.

assistance of such other persons as the City Council may direct. If the administrative official shall find that any
of the provisions of these zoning regulations are being violated, the official shall notify in writing the person

it. The administrative official shall order discontinuance of any illegal use of land, buildings, or structures;

discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by these zoning
regulations to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.
166.02 DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL AND AGENCIES.
1. Administrative Official and Board of Adjustment. It is the intent of these zoning regulations
that all questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the administrative official,

of the administrative official, and that recourse from the decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be
to the courts as provided by law and particularly by statute.

interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as
stated in this section and these zoning regulations. Under these zoning regulations, the City Council
shall have only the duties of: (i) considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of these zoning regulations, as provided by law; and (ii) considering applications for special
permits for exceptions to prohibited uses as specified in Section 165.19 of these zoning regulations.

accompanied by plans in duplicate or by electronic copy, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and
shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if any; and
the location and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration. The application shall include such other
information as lawfully may be required by the administrative official, including existing or proposed building
or alteration; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families, housekeeping units, or
rental units the building is designed to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as
may be necessary to determine conformance with, and provide for, the enforcement of these zoning regulations.

application for building permits after the same has been submitted in proper form.
166.05 CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE FOR NEW, ALTERED OR

administrative official stating that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements
of these zoning regulations.
2. No nonconforming structure or use shall be maintained, renewed, changed, or extended until a
certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the administrative official. The certificate of

these zoning regulations; provided, upon enactment or amendment of these zoning regulations, owners
or occupants of nonconforming uses or structures shall have one year to apply for certificates of zoning
compliance. Failure to make such application within one year shall be presumptive evidence that the
property was in conforming use at the time of enactment or amendment of these zoning regulations.
3. Certificates of zoning compliance shall be applied for coincidentally with the application for a
building permit, and shall be issued within 10 days after the lawful erection or alteration of the building
is completed in conformity with the provisions of these zoning regulations.
4. A temporary certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by the administrative official for a
period not exceeding six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its
completion; provided, such temporary certificate may require such conditions and safeguards as will
protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
5. The administrative official shall maintain a record of all certificates of zoning compliance, and
copies shall be furnished upon request to any person.
6. Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning compliance shall be a violation of these zoning
regulations.
7. Fees for certificates shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
166.06 EXPIRATION OF BUILDING PERMIT. If the work described in any building permit has not
begun within 180 days after the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire; it shall be canceled by the
administrative official, and written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected. If the work described in
any building permit has not been substantially completed within two years after the date of issuance thereof, said

and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these zoning regulations.

occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully the
causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the administrative official, who shall record properly such complaint,

unless and until:
1. Submission of Application. A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:

permitted use of land, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the
issuance of a variance.

the applicant for a variance.

forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
7. Conditions For Granting Variance.
A. The Board shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of these zoning regulations, and will not be
injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with these zoning regulations. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed
a violation of these zoning regulations.

under the terms of these zoning regulations in the district involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.

heard. Such amendment, supplement, or change shall not become effective except by favorable vote of
a majority of all of the members of the City Council.
2. Initiation of Amendments. An amendment of text may be initiated by a motion of the City
Council. An amendment may be initiated by a motion of the City Council, or any person, firm or

charges, and expenses and a collection procedure for an amendment to these zoning regulations. The
schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the administrative official, and may be altered or

be paid at the time the rezoning petition is initially submitted.

the Council. The property owner shall remove the sign within seven days of the date of
the final action on the rezoning amendment by the Council.
6. Conceptual Master Plans for Rezoning Amendment. Conceptual master plans are intended to
present basic development information in such a way as to empower area residents, interested parties,
City staff and Council to accurately and decisively formulate opinions on the proposed development.
Conceptual master plans shall be required for all proposed rezoning of land within the City to a
commercial or manufacturing district. At the discretion of the administrative official, a conceptual

are meant to impose additional conditions or restrictions on the property being rezoned beyond the

surrounding established neighborhood and character of the City at large. The conditions must be
reasonable and agreed to by the property owner prior to the final consideration of the rezoning request.

comprehensive plan, the applicant will be required to request a comprehensive plan amendment in

the Council, the Commission shall review the proposed amendment and report its recommendations
within 60 days to the Council for final action.

Council, at a public hearing, shall then take final action on the proposed amendment, after public notice
in accordance with applicable State law. The amendment shall become effective by the favorable vote
of a majority of all the members of the Council.

Commission disapproves of the amendment; or (ii) a written protest against such change signed by the
owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such a proposed change, or by the

2. Statement of Intent. The R-5 District is intended and designed to provide a
means for the development of large tracts of ground on a unit basis, allowing greater
flexibility and diversification of land uses and building locations than the conventional
single lot method provided in other chapters of these zoning regulations in AR, R-1,

good land use planning, including an orderly and graded relationship between various
types of uses, be maintained and that the sound zoning standards as set forth in these
zoning regulations and statutes concerning population density, adequate light and air,
recreation and open space, and building coverage be preserved.

a plan for the use and development of the entire tract of land. The
development plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for study and report. The Commission shall review the conformity of the
proposed development with the standards of the comprehensive plan, and with
recognized principles of architectural design, land use planning, and
landscape architecture.
B. The Commission may approve the plan as submitted or, before
approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend the
plan as the Commission deems necessary to the end that it preserves the intent
and purpose of these zoning regulations to promote public health, safety,
morals, and the general welfare. The development plan as approved by the
Commission shall then be reported to the Council, whereupon the Council
may approve or disapprove said plan as reported or may require such changes
thereto as it deems necessary to effectuate the intent and purposes of these
zoning regulations.
C. If the Council approves the preliminary plan and request for rezoning,
the applicant shall submit to the Commission, within 270 days or such longer
period as may be approved by the Council, a final development plan, in
triplicate, of not less than one stage of the proposed development showing in
detail the location of all proposed:
(1) Buildings and uses, the height and exterior design of typical
dwellings and the number of dwelling units in each;
(2) Parking areas;
(3) Access drives;
(4) Streets abutting or within the proposed development;

includes common land that will not be dedicated to the City, and the proposed
development will not be held in single ownership, proposed bylaws of a
homeowners’ association fully defining the functions, responsibilities, and
operating procedures of the association shall be included. The proposed
bylaws shall include, but not be limited to, provisions:
(1) Automatically extending membership in the association to all
owners of dwelling units within the development;

by the final development;
(3) Granting to each owner of a dwelling unit within the
development the right to the use and enjoyment of the common
property;
(4) Placing the responsibility for operation and maintenance of

District, the one-family dwelling requirement shall apply.) Net development area
shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside actually proposed for streets from

development plan contingent upon the completion of construction and improvements
within a reasonable period of time; provided, however, in the determination of such
period, the Council shall consider the scope and magnitude of the development project
and any schedule of construction and improvements submitted by the developer.
Failure to complete all construction and improvements within said period of time shall
be deemed sufficient cause for the Council to rezone the unimproved property to the
classification effective at the time of original submission of the development plan,
unless an extension as recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council
for due cause shown. Any proposed change in the development plan after approval by
the Council shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original
proposal. The term “unimproved property” means all property situated within a stage
or stages of the final development plan upon which the installation of improvements
has not been commenced.

improvements be commenced in the second or subsequent stages of the final
development plan until such time as 90 percent of infrastructure improvements
including streets and utilities have been completed in any prior stage of such plan.

8. Adult Entertainment Businesses, as Permitted in M-1A and M-2 Districts. It
is the purpose of this section to regulate adult entertainment businesses to limit their
inherent adverse impact in the community while at the same time permitting lawful
businesses to conduct operations in the community. The Council finds as evidenced
in other cities that the number of adult entertainment businesses is increasing and that,
because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious, objectionable
operational characteristics, which are magnified when located in close proximity to
dwellings, churches, schools, and parks. Special regulation of adult entertainment
businesses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The Council further finds
that these regulations are necessary to protect the youth of this community from the
objectionable operational characteristics of such businesses by restricting their
CHAPTER 169
ZONING REGULATIONS
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
location. The Council further finds that these regulations are necessary to protect the
health, safety and general welfare of all residents of the community.
A. Limitations. Adult entertainment businesses are subject to the

CHAPTER 169
ZONING REGULATIONS
DISTRICT REGULATIONS
169.30 PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. The PD (planned development)
overlay district is intended to provide flexibility in the design of planned projects, to
encourage innovation in project design that incorporates open space and other amenities, and
to ensure compatibility of developments with the surrounding urban environment. The PD
(planned development) district is intended to promote developments that will be advantageous
to the City and its urban form by permitting project design that will surpass the quality of
development resulting from application of the regulations of conventional zoning districts.
While the PD District may appear to deviate from a literal interpretation of the land
development regulations, it is not intended to encourage deviations from the City’s
Comprehensive Plan or overall development objectives. The district shall not be used to
secure approval for projects that do not conform to the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
1. PD-1 District Established. In order to permit maximum applicability of the
PD district, the PD-1 District is hereby created. The PD-1 (general planned
development) District is intended to accommodate large, comprehensively planned
developments that are likely to develop over a relatively long period of time. The
PD-1 creates special guidelines and regulations to ensure that development over time
conforms to an established master plan. The PD-1 also may establish the preliminary
plat for those projects which require platting.
2. Criteria For Use. The PD (planned development) District is generally
intended for use in the following urban contexts:
A. Vacant Land. Areas of substantial open space where the structure of
conventional zoning may artificially limit or constrain good urban design,
may restrict the achievement of the city's development objectives, or may not
be appropriate to changes in technology or demand consistent with the best
interests of the City.
B. Community Development Areas. Community development areas are
areas of the City that are in need of rehabilitation or redevelopment, including
areas that may be deficient in public facilities or services. In these situations,
the PD District may encourage private investment by recognizing the need for
flexibility that conventional zoning regulations do not provide.
C. Neighborhood Contexts. Neighborhood contexts are areas in which
sensitive project design is critical to maintain and protect the value of
surrounding residential neighborhoods and other sensitive or vulnerable urban
settings.
D. Large Projects. Large projects are projects that have substantial
effects on their urban and rural surroundings because of their size and scale.
E. Large Areas. Large areas are areas that may be zoned prior to
development by the Commission and Council consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, but which require individual project approval as
development occurs.
3. Permitted Land Uses. A planned development may include residential, office,
commercial, industrial, or public land uses, subject to the requirements of the
underlying zoning district.
4. PD-1 District Requirements; Application Procedure.
A. Minimum Size. The minimum size of a PD-1 District shall be three
acres.
B. Pre-Application Concept Plan. Prior to filing an application for
approval of a PD-1 District, the applicant shall meet with the administrative
official for the purpose of submitting a pre-application concept plan. This
plan shall illustrate the conceptual overall plan for the district and shall
include at a minimum the information required in Table 1, subsection 6 of this
section.
C. Review and Comment On Plan. The administrative official shall
review and comment on the proposed concept plan and shall provide the
applicant with written comments within 30 days of submission of the concept
plan.
D. Criteria for Consideration. The review of the concept plan shall
include consideration of the following criteria:
(1) Land use intensity and density.
(2) Ability to provide a positive environment for intended uses,
including schematic building configurations, arrangements, and
general landscaping and site design.
(3) Use of open space.
(4) Impact on the surrounding natural and built environment.
(5) Adequacy of on- and off-site transportation and utility
systems to serve the proposed project.
(6) Consistency with the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
E. Filing of Formal Application. Following review of the preapplication
concept plan, the applicant may proceed with filing a formal
application for approval of a PD-1 District. This plan shall illustrate the
development master plan for the district and shall include at a minimum the
information required in Table 1, subsection 6 of this section.
F. Development Agreement. A PD-1 application shall include a
development agreement establishing the development regulations for the
district unless initiated by the Commission or Council. The development
agreement shall specify the following regulations:
(1) Location and quantities of various land uses.
(2) Maximum floor area ratios and residential densities.
(3) Maximum building and impervious coverage.
(4) Front, side, and rear yard setbacks.
(5) Maximum heights of proposed structures.
(6) Design standards applicable to the project.
(7) Incorporation of graphic development plans and drawings
into the site development regulations.
G. Commission and Council Review. The Commission and Council
shall review and evaluate each PD-1 District application. The Commission
and Council may impose reasonable conditions, as deemed necessary to
ensure that a PD shall be compatible with adjacent land uses, will not
overburden public services and facilities and will not be detrimental to public
health, safety and welfare.
H. Action of Commission. The Commission, after proper notice, shall
consider and act upon each application. The Commission may recommend
amendments to PD-1 District applications. The recommendation of the
Commission shall be transmitted to the Council for final action.
I. Public Hearing by Council. The Council, after proper notice, shall
hold a public hearing and act upon any ordinance establishing a PD-1 District.
Proper notice shall mean the same notice established for any other zoning
amendment.
J. Basis for Decisions. In their respective reviews of the PD-1
application, the Commission and Council shall base decisions on findings of
fact as set forth in the criteria presented in Table 2, subsection 7 of this
section.
K. Filing of Approved Plans. Upon approval by the Council, the
development plan and agreement shall become a part of the ordinance
creating or amending the PD District. All approved plans shall be filed with
the City Clerk.
L. Issuance of Building Permits; Certificates of Occupancy. The City
shall not issue a building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit for
a building, structure, or use within a PD-1 District unless it is in compliance
with the approved development plan or any approved amendments.
M. Changes or Modifications To Development Plans. The administrative
official is authorized at his/her discretion to approve amendments to an
approved development plan; provided, that:
(1) A written request is filed with the administrative official,
along with information specifying the exact nature of the proposed
amendment.
(2) The amendment is consistent with the provisions of this
section.
(3) The amendment does not alter the approved site regulations
of the development plan and does not materially alter other aspects of
the plan, including traffic circulation, land uses or land use intensity,
mixture of use types, and physical design.
(4) Any amendment not conforming to these provisions shall be
submitted to the Commission and Council for action.
N. Termination of PD-1 District. If no substantial development has
taken place in a planned development district for three years following
approval of the district, the Commission shall reconsider the zoning of the
property and may, on its own motion, initiate an application for rezoning the
property.
5. Commission- or Council-Initiated PD-1 District. In some situations, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council may initiate or approve a
rezoning of an area to a PD-1 District without submission of a detailed development
plan. This action establishes the land uses permitted in an area consistent with the
comprehensive development plan, but requires subsequent approval of specific
projects through the normal PD-1 submission or approval procedures. An application
for creation of such a PD-1 District shall include the following, prepared by the
administrative official or the applicant:
A. Statement. A statement describing the special characteristics of the
district and the reason for its creation.
B. Map. A map indicating the boundaries of the proposed district.
C. Plan. A generalized area development plan for the proposed district,
including:
(1) A land use component, identifying proposed uses and the
extent and location of each use.
(2) A transportation element, identifying any relevant vehicular,
pedestrian, or bicycle transportation improvements necessary to
ultimate development of the area.
(3) A utility service statement, identifying any necessary utility
or infrastructure improvements necessary to the ultimate development
of the area.
(4) An urban design element, if applicable, describing design
frameworks, building scale and relationships, siting, landscape
design, and other guidelines relating to the specific physical or urban
environment of the proposed district.

§201.21.1 Appliances to Comply With Standard Requirements. Each gas appliance
and accessory designed for domestic or commercial use shall be of a type complying with applicable
American Standard Approval or Listing Requirements covering safe operation, substantial and durable
construction and acceptable performance. Such compliance may be determined by the presence on the
appliance or accessory of a label of a nationally recognized testing agency* acceptable to the Gas Utility
qualified and equipped to perform the test necessary to determine such compliance and maintaining an
adequate periodic inspection of current production models, and whose label on the appliance or
accessory states that it complies with national safety requirements. Such compliance may also be
determined by the listing of the appliances or accessory in a list published by such nationally recognized
testing agency, which states that the appliance or accessory complies with national safety requirements.
In cases where no applicable American Standard Approval or Listing Requirements have been
developed for a given class of appliance or accessory, approval of the administrative authority shall be
obtained before the appliance or accessory is installed.
§201.21.2 Type of Gas. It shall be determined that the appliance has been designated for
use with the gas to which it will be connected. No attempt shall be made to convert the appliance from
the gas specified on the rating plate for use with a different gas without consulting the local gas utility or
the manufacturer for complete instructions.
§201.21.3 Permissible Temperatures on Combustion Materials. All gas appliances
and their flue or vent connectors shall be installed so that continued or intermittent operation will not
create a hazard to persons or property.

types of appliances and their flue or vent connectors are specified in Sections 201.24 through 201.45.
§201.21.4 Air For Combustion. Appliances shall be installed in a location in which the
facilities for ventilation permit satisfactory combustion of gas and proper venting, under normal
conditions of use. While all forms of building construction cannot be covered in detail, this requirement
may usually be met by application of one of the following methods in ordinary building construction:
*The American Gas Association, Inc., Laboratories are such a nationally recognized testing
agency.
A. In buildings of conventional frame, brick, or stone construction without enclosed
17
appliance rooms, basement storm windows, or tight stair doors, infiltration is
normally adequate to provide air for combustion and draft hood dilution.
B. Where appliances are installed in a confined space within a building, provision
may be made for supplying this space with air for combustion and ventilation by
eliminating the ceiling of the confined space; provided, however, that the area
above this confined space freely communicates with the outdoors.
C. Where appliances are installed in a confined space within a building having
adequate air infiltrations, provisions shall be made for supplying this space with
air for combustion and ventilation. This may be accomplished through use of
two permanent openings freely communicating with interior areas of adequate
infiltration or by compliance with provisions of item B. or D. These two
permanent openings shall each have an area of not less than 1 sq. in. per 1000
Btu per hour of input rating. One opening shall be near the bottom. If
necessary, continuous ducts having cross-sectional areas equal to the opening
shall be utilized to communicate with the source of air supply. The minimum
dimensions of rectangular air ducts shall be not less than 3 inches.
D. Where appliances are installed in a confined space within a building, the building
being of unusually tight construction, air for combustion and ventilation must be
obtained directly from outdoors or from spaces (crawl or attic) freely
communicating with the outdoors. Under these conditions, the openings called
for in C. shall be replaced either by the provision B. above or by two openings
having a combined area of not less than one square inch per 1000 Btu per hour
of input rating. One opening shall be near the top of the enclosure and one near
the bottom.
These openings shall be of approximately equal area and shall communicate
with the selected source or sources of adequate air supply by continuous ducts
of the same cross sectional area as the openings to which they connect. The
minimum dimensions of rectangular air ducts shall be not less than 3 inches.
Any duct from the top opening must be horizontal or pitched upward.
E. Where appliances are installed in unconfined spaces, such as a full basement,
within a building of usually tight construction, air for combustion and ventilation
must be obtained from outdoors or from spaces freely communicating with the
outdoors. Under these conditions, a permanent opening or openings having a
total free area of not less than 1 sq. in. per 1000 Btu per hour of input rating
shall be provided. Where ducts are required, they shall be of the same crosssectional
area as the openings to which they connect. The minimum dimension
of rectangular air ducts shall be not less than 3 inches.
F. The size of combustion air openings specified in 201.21.4 shall not necessarily
govern in installation having a combination input in excess of 400,000 Btu/Hr.

is used in connection with the gas supply, effective means shall be provided to prevent air or oxygen
from passing back into the gas piping. The local Gas Company shall be consulted for details.
§201.21.12 Venting of Pressure Regulators. Gas appliance pressure regulators
requiring access to the atmosphere for successful operation shall be equipped with a vent pipe leading to
the outer air or into the combustion chamber adjacent to a constantly burning pilot, unless constructed
or equipped to limit the escape of gas from the vent opening in the event of diaphragm failure to not
more than 1.0 cu. ft. per hour of a 0.6 sp. gr. gas at 7 inches water column pressure. In case of vents
leading to the outer air, means shall be employed to prevent water from entering this pipe and also to
prevent stoppage of it by insects and foreign matter. In case of vents entering the combustion chamber,
the vent shall be located so that the escaping gas will be readily ignited from the pilot flame and the heat
liberated will not adversely affect the operation of the terminal element. The terminus of the vent shall be
securely held in a fixed position relative to the pilot flame. For manufactured gas a flame arrestor in the
vent line may also be necessary.
§201.21.13 Listed Automatic Pilot Required With Automatic Controls. The

§201.41.12 Fireplace. A flue or vent connector shall not be connected to a chimney flue
having a fireplace opening unless the opening is permanently sealed.
34
§201.42 Flues or Vents. (This section applies only to natural draft venting. Forced
draft or exhaust systems and power burners usually require special engineering and installation and
should be approved by the administrative authority.)
§201.42.1 Check Chimney. Before connecting a flue or vent connector, the flue or vent
shall be examined to ascertain that it is properly constructed, clear, and will freely conduct the products
of combustion to the outer air.
§201.42.2 Size. The flue or vent to which the flue or vent connector is connected shall be
of a size equal to the draft hood collar or as specified in Table 10. In no case shall the area be less than
the area of 3 inch diameter pipe. When more than one appliance vents into a flue or vent, the flue or
vent area shall be not less than the area of the largest flue or vent connector plus 50 percent of the areas
of the additional flue or vent connectors. An elliptical or rectangular flue or vent may be used provided
its flue gas venting capacity as determined from manufacturer's capacity tables is equal to the capacity of
round pipe for which it is substituted.
§201.42.3 Height. The flue or vent should extend high enough above the building or other
neighboring obstruction so that wind from any direction will not strike the flue or vent from an angle
above horizontal. Unless the obstruction is of great magnitude, it is usual experience that a flue or vent
extended at least two feet above flat roofs or two feet above the highest part of wall parapets and
peaked roofs within 20 feet will be reasonably free from down drafts.

closed when not in use.
§201.42.6 Venting Into Flues Used for Other Fuels. A gas appliance automatically
controlled may be connected through separate openings to a flue that also serves equipment for the
combustion of solid or liquid fuel. In no case shall a gas vent and a vent for a solid or liquid fuel be
connected together by a "y" before entering a common flue. If two or more openings are provided into
one flue they should be different levels.
§201.42.7 Flue Connecting Two or More Gas Appliances. In order to promote better
draft where more than one gas appliance flue or vent connector is connected to a flue or vent, the
connections should be made at different levels. Two or more gas appliances may be vented through a
common flue or vent connector when necessary, if jointed as close as practical to the flue or vent, and
provided the size of the common flue or vent is sufficient to accommodate the total volume of flue
gasses. All transitions shall be in accordance with manufacturer's instructions or in a manner acceptable
to the administrative authority.
§201.42.8 Unlined Chimneys. Where an existing chimney is unlined or where local
experience indicates that flue gas condensate might be a problem, consult the administrative authority,
for information about liners that are suitable for the locality.
§201.42.9 Vent Tops. A vent top acceptable to the administrative authority which does
not obstruct or reduce the effective cross-sectional area of the flue or vent outlet shall be used on all
type B and type C vents. Movable or spinner type vent caps are strictly prohibited.
§201.42.10 Room Exhausters and Appliance Blowers. No fan or blower shall be
discharged into any vent, flue, chimney or flue or vent connector into which a gas appliance is vented by
natural draft unless the vent connector from the natural draft gas appliance is reconnected to the suction
side of the fan or blower.
36
§201.43 Outside Flues or Vent.
§201.43.1 Material. Outside flues or vents are not recommended and they are
particularly unsuccessful in severe climates and in small sizes, but when they must be used the material
shall be resistant to the action of combustion products and shall possess adequate insulation qualities or
be adequately insulated to minimize condensation and aid draft.
§201.43.2 Support Flue or Vent Pipe. When a flue or vent must be installed on the
outside of the building, it shall be securely supported.
§201.43.3 Prohibited Installation. Natural draft vents extending through and terminating
adjacent to outside walls are prohibited. (See 201.43.3)
§201.44 Special Venting Arrangements.
§201.44.1 Appliances With Sealed Combustion Chambers. The provisions of
§201.39 to §201.43 inclusive, do not apply to listed appliances having sealed combustion chambers

damper is used in a normally stationary position to limit chimney draft, positive means
shall be provided to lock the damper in position. The manually operated damper shall
be installed between the boiler and any application of automatic or modulating draft
limiting devices.
C. When an automatically controlled or modulating damper is used with the burner control
assembly, this damper shall be interlocked with the burner input control valve to prevent
lighting the burner unless the damper is open.
D. Adjustable (modulating) dampers, where used for fuel-air ratio-control, shall be
equipped with suitable located maximum and minimum operating stops. The minimum
operating stops for such dampers shall be located to assure combustion of the gas at the
minimum burner input. These dampers shall be counterbalanced to open in event of
breakage or failure of their operating means.
39
§201.55 Burners. The burner or burners and their component parts shall be properly
installed and firmly secured in accordance with the burner manufacturer's instructions. The burner or
burners must be installed in such a manner as to permit their being withdrawn for repairs or alterations
without disturbing the furnace walls or settings. Weight of the walls must not rest on horizontal burners.
The gas must be burned in such a manner throughout the range of turndown so there will be no
puffing, vibration, flame lifting, backfiring or injurious flame impingement on walls or heating surfaces in a
manner that will cause damage to the boiler parts.
Burners shall also maintain stable combustion at the minimum rate of firing or during any sudden
changes in the gas-firing rate between maximum and minimum rates.
§201.56 Air Intakes.
A. Air openings into the combustion chamber of firebox shall be provided with
sufficient area to supply an adequate amount of air for combustion under the
actual draft conditions existing at the maximum rate of firing. The air shall be
introduced in a manner so as to obtain thorough mixing of the gas and air in
order to assure combustion within the space provided.
B. For manually or automatically controlled boilers having forced or induced draft
fan or both, means shall be provided to continue safe combustion or to shut off
the gas in case of draft failure for any cause. Forced or induced draft
installations shall be provided with a mechanical timer to require a five-minute
purge period prior to pilot ignition after shut down. No spark or ignition shall
be allowed to occur in the firebox during the purging cycle.
§201.57 Pilots.
A. An adequate gas pilot or pilots shall be used to assure positive ignition of the
burner or burners.
B. An automatic pilot device or flame safeguard so constructed and installed that
no gas can flow to the main burner or burner group unless satisfactory ignition is
assured, shall be employed at each burner or group of burners operating as a
unit, for all automatically controlled boilers. Gas to main burners and to
intermittent or ignition pilots shall be automatically shut off in case of flame
failure at the point of supervision.
C. The response time of the flame safeguard to de-energize the gas shutoff device
on flame failure shall not exceed 5 seconds for unlisted boilers having inputs in
excess of 400,000 Btu per hour. Pilot supervision by such automatic pilot
device shall be only at the point where the flame will effectively ignite the gas at
the main burner of burners.
D. Electric ignition systems shall ignite, only a pilot. The input to the pilot shall not
exceed 3 percent of the maximum input to the main burner as fired. If ignition of
the pilot is not obtained within 15 seconds, the gas shall shut off automatically.
40
E. All pilot burners and automatic pilot devices shall be supported in such a
manner that their position relative to each other and to the flame of the main
burner or burners will remain fixed. Means shall be provided to permit ready
observation of all three while firing. No wiring or control shall be subjected to
the heat from the burner unless it is specifically designed to withstand such
temperatures.
F. All automatic pilot burners and automatic pilot devices shall be readily
accessible and removable for servicing. Pilot burners shall be placed so that
they can be safely lighted manually, if required. Where push button controls are
used for manually opening pilot solenoid valves, they shall be installed so one
operator can light the automatic pilot and operate the push button
simultaneously.
G. On automatically controlled boilers, the gas supply pressure to the pilot or
group of pilots shall be regulated independently of the main burner supply by a
gas pressure regulator in the pilot supply line.
H. Pilot lines shall be connected to vertical main gas supply pipes or to the sides or
top of horizontal lines upstream from all gas control valves and they shall be
independently controlled by a manually operated pilot shut-off valve, on
installation requiring more than one pilot, a manually operated shut-off valve
shall be provided for each pilot.
§201.58 Manual Shut-off Valves.
A. Each boiler burner assembly shall have a lubricating plug type shut-off valve
with handle permanently attached that will shut off the gas to the burner and
control valve assembly.
B. If the firing rate of the burner is controlled manually, each burner shall have a
separate firing valve designed for the maximum operating gas pressure on the
burner.
§201.59 Control Valves.
A. All boiler input control valves and safety shut-off valves must be installed
downstream from the shut-off valves described in 201.58(A).
B. A by-pass may be installed around a throttling type burner input control valve to
provide for minimum flame. When such a by-pass or minimum flow setting is
used with a burner input control valve, a separate safety shut-off valve shall be
installed to shut off the gas supply when the limit or protective controls are
actuated.
C. Electrically operated safety shut-off valves shall fail-safe and not depend on
41
electricity to shut off of the gas supply. All vents from any control valve
actuated by gas pressure shall be piped into the firebox adjacent to a constant
burning pilot or to a safe point outside the building. Iron or steel pipe or tubing
shall be used for venting the valve.
§201.60 Gas Pressure Regulators.
A. Where the gas supply pressure to the burner is higher than that at which the
burners normally operate on a particular installation, a gas pressure regulator
shall be used.
B. Regulators shall be of the spring loaded, dead weight or pressure balance type
and they shall maintain a gas pressure within 10% of the operating pressure
from maximum to minimum firing rates. The weight and lever type of regulator
shall not be used.
C. The pressure regulators shall be vested (1) into the furnace adjacent to a
constant burning pilot, or (2) to a safe point on the outside of the building. Iron

any permit is issued and any connection to the public sewer system authorized, the person who
makes the application shall pay to the City Clerk a fee to be set by resolution of the council of the
City of Waukee which shall cover the cost of issuing the permit, supervising, regulating and
inspecting the work, and making necessary engineering studies.
[October 8, 1985]
§204.15 Special Fee. If the property to be connected to a public sewer has not been
assessed for any part of the costs of construction of the public sewer, or has been assessed only as
an unimproved lot, the owner shall pay a special fee to the City Clerk of for the use of the public
sewers before the permit is issued. The amount of this fee shall be an equitable portion of the cost
of the public sewers in relation to the benefits received by the property, but in no event less than the
sum of $250 for each direct benefit factor, and shall be determined by the sewer inspector subject to
approval, modification or revocation by the City Council at its next regular meeting.
Subsection A repealed; October, 17, 2005 – Ordinance 2539

to occasion the least possible inconvenience to the public and to provide for passage of water along
the gutter. All such excavations shall have proper barricades at all times, and warning lights placed
from one-half hour before sunset and one-half hour after sunrise. In refilling the excavation, the
earth must be laid in layers and each layer tamped thoroughly to prevent settlement, and, this work
and any street, sidewalk, pavement or other public property that is affected, must be restored to as
good a condition as it was previous to the excavation. The excavator must maintain the affected
area in good repair to the satisfaction of the city council for two years after refilling. No excavation

any. If there is no sewer connection extending from the public sewer to the property line, the sewer
inspector shall supervise a measurement for the location of the "Y" branch in the public sewer.
Excavations shall be made at the point designated by the sewer inspector and if no "Y" branch is
found within a reasonable distance, then the plumber shall connect directly with the public sewer at
that point. The sewer inspector may give permission in writing to property owners to make a
connection at other points if the property owner has shown good reason for the change.
§204.21 Unlawful Discharge.
A. All storm, surface and ground water connections, including foundation
drainage to the sanitary sewer system are prohibited.
B. No owner or occupant of any new structure shall discharge or permit to be
discharged into the sanitary sewers any substance which will clog the pipes,
produce explosive mixtures, destroy or materially damage the pipes or other
joints, or interfere with the sewage disposal process.
C. No owner or occupant of any existing building or structures shall discharge
or permit to be discharged into the sanitary sewers any surface water or other
substances which will clog the pipes, produce explosive mixtures, destroy or
materially damage the pipes or other joints, or interfere unduly with the
sewage disposal process.
§204.22 Inspection and Approval. All private sewers and their connections with
7
the public sewer must be inspected and approved in writing by the sewer inspector before they are
covered and the sewer inspector shall make a record of his approval on the application form kept in
the city clerk's record. If the sewer inspector refused to approve the work, the plumber or owner
must proceed immediately to correct the work so that it will meet with such approval. Every person
who uses or intends to use the public sewers shall permit the sewer inspector or his authorized
assistant to enter the premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or repairs at all reasonable
hours and on proof of authority.
§204.23 Breaks in Service. The City of Waukee, Iowa, shall not be held
responsible by reason of the breaking, plugging, or restriction of any service pipe, public sewer,
private sewer, building drain, building sewer or failure in the sewer system.
§204.24 Abandoned Service Pipes. All private sewer lines that may become
useless because of laying of larger or other such lines, or because sewage will no longer flow
through them, must be permanently closed off at the connection with the public sewer at the
expense of the owner of the premises, and so reported to the sewer inspector. No plumber, or owner
of property shall disconnect or remove sewer facilities from any premises served by the public
sewer, or alter the same in such a way as to make the service connection unnecessary for the
premises, without permanently closing off the connection at the public sewer and reporting the same
to the sewer inspector.
§204.25 Completion by the City. Should any excavation be left open or partly
refilled for twenty-four (24) hours after the private sewer is installed and connected with the public
sewer, or should the work be improperly done, the sewer inspector shall have the right to finish or
correct the work, and the City Council shall assess the cost to the property owner or the plumber. If
the plumber is assessed, he must pay the costs before he can receive another permit, and the
plumber's bond required by this ordinance shall be security for the assessment. If the property
owner is assessed, such assessment shall be collected with and in the same manner as general
property taxes.

DIVISION 2. WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND PRETREATMENT
Sec. 204-61. User requirements.
(a) The following requirements shall apply to all users of the POTW:
(1) All users shall promptly notify the WRA director and the City of Waukee in advance
of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.
(2) New or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the nature of pollutant
discharged to the POTW shall require prior approval by the WRA director.
(3) Industrial users shall notify the WRA director, the City of Waukee, the
Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. The
notification shall comply with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(4) Discharge of any pollutants without the notice and approval required by this section
is prohibited. Upon the receipt of notice required by this section, the WRA director shall
within 180 days or less approve the discharge if he or she finds the proposed discharge
meets applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and would not cause the WRA to
violate its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The WRA director shall
deny permission for the discharge if he or she finds applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements are not met or the discharge would cause a violation of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF. In lieu of denial of permission for
discharge, the WRA director may allow such discharge or contribution upon conditions
which would not violate applicable pretreatment standards or requirements and would not
cause a violation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the
WRF.
(5) Food Service Establishments shall be regulated first under Division 5 of this
ordinance but may be required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit and be subject to the
requirements of Divisions 1-4 if the WRA Director determines that additional pretreatment
is required in order to comply with Fat, Oil, & Grease discharge limits.
(b) Any part of this section notwithstanding, upon receipt of the notice required by this section,
the WRA director may require, in addition to the requirements of this section, that an industrial user
obtain a permit under this article.
(c) Users who are determined to be industrial users as herein defined and who refuse to apply
for or obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to termination of sewer services as
provided in section 204-152 hereof.

spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt residues from refining or processing of
fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing waste, or tumbling and de-burring
stones, and wastewater containing fat, wax, O&G, or other substances which may solidify or
become viscous at temperatures between 32 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (0 and 65 degrees
Celsius).
(4) Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a
discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which will cause interference or pass
through at the WRF or which constitutes a slug load as defined in this article.
(5) Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater or vapor having a temperature higher than 150
degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) at the point of introduction into the POTW, and in
no case wastewater or vapor which alone or in concert with other discharges produces a
temperature at the WRF greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
(6) Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in
amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
(7) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the

(a) Generally. Local limits for specific pollutants discharged pursuant to this article shall be as
follows:
(1) Dilution. Dilution of the discharge from a pretreatment facility or from a regulated
process is prohibited as a method for treatment of wastes in order to meet the limits set forth
in this article.
(2) Sample location. Measurement of pollutant concentrations to determine compliance
shall be made at the point immediately following the pretreatment facility and before
mixture with other waters, unless another point is designated by the WRA director. If
necessary, the concentrations so measured shall be recomputed to exclude the effect of any
dilution that is improper using the combined waste stream formula.
(b) Headworks limits; average mass. The average composite loading of all industrial users
contributing the following specific pollutants to the POTW shall not exceed the allowable total
pounds. The allocation of pollutants between industrial and nonindustrial sources may be adjusted

user to enforcement action. The WRA is required to notify all known affected categorical users of
the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Failure of the WRA to notify a user
shall not relieve the user of the duty, if any, to comply with National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
Sec. 204-65. State requirements.
State of Iowa requirements and limitations on discharges pursuant to this article shall apply when
they are more stringent than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or WRA requirements and
limitations unless allowed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
Sec. 204-66. City's right of revision.
The City of Waukee, acting at the direction of the WRA, reserves the right to establish more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW than those contained in this article
if deemed necessary to comply with the purpose and policy objectives presented in section 204-30
of this article.
Sec. 204-67. Pretreatment.
(a) A user discharging or with potential to discharge any waste into the POTW as set forth in
section 204-62, 204-63 or 204-64 of this division shall be required by the WRA director to
construct, install and operate, at the user's sole expense, such pretreatment facilities as may be
required in order to:
(1) Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents of wastewater to within the
maximum limits provided for in sections 204-62, 204-63, 204-64 and 204-65 of this article.
(2) Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such wastewater.
(3) Reduce the pollutants to such concentration and flows as may be contained in the
user's wastewater discharge permit.
(4) Prevent the discharge of liquid waste containing FOG, sand in excessive amounts,
any flammable waste, or other harmful pollutants. All traps or similar devices shall be of a
type and capacity needed to perform effectively and shall be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. All traps or devices shall be provided and maintained in efficient
operating condition at all times. Materials removed from traps shall be considered
unacceptable for disposal at the WRF unless specifically approved by the WRA director.
29
(b) All plans, specifications, technical operating data and other information pertinent to the
proposed operation and maintenance of pretreatment facilities shall be reviewed and approved by
the WRA director prior to construction. Design and installation of such facilities shall be subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, chapters and laws, including local zoning regulations. The
review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall, in no way, relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
WRA director under this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operations shall be reported to and be acceptable to the WRA director prior to the user's initiations
of the changes.
(c) Users shall continuously maintain all pretreatment facilities required by this article in
satisfactory and effective operating condition at the sole expense of such user.
(d) No section contained in this article shall be construed to prevent or prohibit a separate or
special agreement between the WRA and any user whereby wastewater containing waste of unusual
strength, character or composition may be accepted for treatment, subject to additional payment by
such user; provided, however, that such agreement shall have the prior approval of the WRA Board,
shall not conflict with the Iowa department of natural resources and U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency requirements, and shall be consistent with subsection 204-63(b) and sections 204-64 and
204-65 of this article, and subsection (f) of this section.
(e) The WRA director may reject any waste which, in the opinion of the director, may cause
interference or pass through.
(f) Users shall obtain the specific approval of the WRA director prior to discharging any waste
resulting from a pretreatment facility to the POTW. The WRA director may develop a
documentation system to track the transportation and final disposition of any pretreatment waste.
Pretreatment waste regulated by this subsection shall include waste generated as a result of
pretreatment processes used to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permits, air pollution permits, wastewater discharge permits, soil/groundwater reclamation
processes, and pollutants resulting from a spill of any liquid or solid material or the cleanup of any
such spill. Pretreatment waste is prohibited from disposal to the water of the state except as
specifically permitted by the Iowa department of natural resources.
Sec. 204-68. Dilution prohibited.
Users shall not increase the use of process water or, in any way; attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or with any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the WRA or its Operating Contractor.
30
Sec. 204-69. Spill containment.
(a) Users having the ability to cause interference or pass through or to discharge a slug shall
provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be constructed, installed, operated and maintained at the user's sole cost and expense.
(b) Users meeting the criteria in subsection (a) of this section shall develop a spill containment
plan. The plan shall require the approval of the WRA director and shall contain the following:
(1) A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges.
(2) A description of stored chemicals.
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the WRA of slug discharges, including any
that would violate the discharge prohibitions in section 204-62 of this division. Notification
procedures shall comply with subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(4) A description of procedures and structures necessary to prevent adverse impacts
upon the POTW from accidental spills including inspection and maintenance of storage
areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant
site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
(5) A schedule for the completion or implementation of necessary procedures and
structures. Complete implementation and installation of any procedures or structures shall be
according to the shortest possible schedule, but in no case longer than one year. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
article.
(c) Users shall immediately telephone and notify the WRA of any accidental or deliberate
discharge of pollutants which violates section 204-62 of this division or which is a slug load. Any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which is a listed or characteristic waste under section 3001
of RCRA must be immediately reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regional
Director, the Iowa department of natural resources, and the WRA. Notifications required in this
subsection shall include the name of caller, location and time of discharge, pollutant concentration,
volume and the corrective actions taken.
(d) Users shall submit a written report to the WRA director within five days following such an
accidental or deliberate discharge describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up reports as may be
required by the WRA director. Such report shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property, nor shall such report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
31
other liability which may be imposed by this article or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or
deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the city; result in the
revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
(e) Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with all applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power to the user's
pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(f) Users required to have a spill containment plan must permanently post a notice in English
and the language of common use on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call if a prohibited discharge occurs. Users shall ensure that all employees who
are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental discharge are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
Sec. 204-70. Treatment upsets.
Users shall inform the WRA director within one hour of becoming aware of an upset in operations
that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance with the pollutant limits in this article. Users
shall provide a follow-up written report to the WRA director within five days. The report must
demonstrate that the pretreatment facility was being operated in a prudent and appropriate manner
and shall contain:
(1) A description of the upset, its cause, and impact on the user's compliance status.
(2) The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance,
and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably
expected to be restored.
(3) All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an
upset.
Sec. 204-71. Treatment bypass.
(a) Under this article, bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage or no feasible alternatives exist such as the use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of
equipment downtime.
(b) The user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause a violation of pretreatment
standards, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation.
(c) Notification of bypass shall be submitted in accordance with the following:
32
(1) Anticipated bypass. If the user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior written notice, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, to the WRA
director.
(2) Unanticipated bypass. The user shall immediately notify the WRA director and
submit a written report to the WRA within five days. This report shall specify the following:
a. A description of the bypass, its cause, and the duration.
b. Whether the bypass has been corrected.

DIVISION 3. INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS AND REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 204-101. Classes of permits.
Discharge permit classifications shall be as follows:
(1) Class A permit issued to a user discharging 25,000 gallons per day or more of
process wastewater (excludes sanitary, non-contact cooling, and boiler blowdown).
(2) Class B permit issued to a user discharging less than 25,000 gallons per day of
process wastewater.
Sec. 204-102. Permit requirements.
(a) All new industrial users shall notify the WRA director of the nature and characteristics of
their proposed discharge 180 days prior to commencing discharge. A notification form prescribed
by the WRA shall be used for this purpose.
(b) Significant users shall discharge wastewater, either directly or indirectly, into the POTW
only after obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the WRA director. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a user of the obligation to obtain other permits required by federal,
state, or local law.
(c) Other users, including waste haulers, shall obtain permits as required by the WRA director.
Sec. 204-103. Permit applications; baseline monitoring reports.
Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit or submitting a baseline monitoring report shall
submit the following information as required by 40 CFR 403.12 or by the WRA director:
(1) Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit must submit an application form
prescribed by the WRA and accompanied by the application fee. All new significant users
must submit such application 180 days prior to the date of any wastewater discharge.
Existing users subject to new National Categorical Pretreatment Standards must, within 180
days after the effective date of the standard, submit such an application. The following
information is required:
a. Name, address, and location of the facility, if different from the mailing
address.
b. The name of a person or agent authorized to accept legal service of process.
c. Standard industrial classification (SIC) code of both the industry as a whole
and any processes for which National Categorical Pretreatment Standards have been
37
promulgated and a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
d. Wastewater constituents and characteristics including any pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by any federal, state, or local standards with sampling
and analysis performed in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency
approved methods, and meeting the following requirements:
1. The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process if the user is a categorical user.
2. All samples shall be representative of daily operations.
3. A minimum of four grab samples, if required, must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all
other pollutants required, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained
through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible.
The WRA director may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any
user who demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In
such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional techniques or
through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that
such sampling will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged.
4. Where the flow of the stream being sampled is less than or equal to
250,000 gallons per day, the user must analyze three samples within a twoweek
period. Where the flow of the stream being sampled is greater than
250,000 gallons per day, the user must analyze six samples within a twoweek
period.
5. Samples must be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with other waste. If nonregulated
wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary
to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in
order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentrations or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to
the WRA director. Users not subject to categorical standards shall submit
analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged to the
POTW.
6. The WRA director may allow the submission of an application which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient
to determine the need for pretreatment.
38
7. A statement indicating the time, date and place of sampling, methods
of analysis, and certifying that such sampling and analysis is representative of
normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW shall
accompany each application/baseline monitoring report unless such sampling
and analysis was performed by the city.
e. Time and duration of all discharges.
f. Daily maximum, daily average, and monthly average wastewater flow rates,
including daily, monthly, and seasonal variations, if any.
g. Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes at the site, including a
list of all raw materials and chemicals used at the facility which are or could
accidentally or intentionally be discharged to the POTW.
h. The site plans, floor plans and mechanical and plumbing plans and details to
show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size, location and elevation. The
plans shall include a schematic process diagram which indicates all points of
discharge to the POTW. All plans must be certified for accuracy by a professional
engineer registered in the state.
i. Each product produced by type, amount, process and rate of production.
j. Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per
day).
k. Number and type of employees and hours of operation and proposed or actual
hours of operation of the pretreatment facility.
l. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the user, as defined
in section 204-113 of this division, and certified to by a professional engineer
registered in the state, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and if not whether additional operation and maintenance or
additional pretreatment is required for the user to meet pretreatment standards and
requirements.
m. If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet pretreatment
standards or requirements, the user shall supply a compliance schedule indicating the
shortest time schedule necessary to accomplish installation or adoption of such
additional pretreatment or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
longer than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
The following conditions apply to this schedule:
1. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
39
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such schedule shall include,
where applicable, but shall not be limited to dates for the hiring of an
engineer, completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing construction, beginning operation, and conducting
routine operations.
2. No increment referred to in subsection (1) m.1 of this section shall
exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18 months.
3. No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final
date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the WRA
director, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and if appropriate the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall
more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the WRA
director.
n. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required
to meet the limits on discharge into the POTW set forth in section 204-62, 204-63,
204-64 of this article, or any other limits set by the WRA director, a plan shall be
provided by the user giving the shortest schedule by which the user will provide the
needed equipment, operation, or maintenance changes and additions to meet such
limits. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. For a
compliance schedule for meeting National Categorical Pretreatment Standards the
following condition shall apply:
1. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required to meet the
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Such schedule shall
include, where applicable, but not be limited to dates for the hiring of an
engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contracts for major components, commencing construction and completing
construction.
2. No time increment in the schedule may exceed nine months.
3. No later than 14 days after each date in the schedule and the final date
for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the WRA director
stating whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met
on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
user to return to the schedule established. In no case shall more than nine
months elapse between such progress reports to the WRA.
40
o. Any additional information required by the WRA director to evaluate a
permit application.

days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.
Sec. 204-107. Continuation of expired permits.
Expired permits issued pursuant to this division shall remain effective and enforceable until the
permit is reissued unless the user is notified of permit termination by the WRA director.
Sec. 204-108. Permit modifications.
(a) The WRA director may modify the permit issued pursuant to this division for good cause,
including but not limited to the following:
42
(1) To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standard or
requirement. After becoming aware of more stringent standards or requirements, the WRA
will, as necessary, update permits within 90 days;
(2) To make material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation
processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the
effective permit;
(3) To make a change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that
requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized
discharge;
(4) Upon receipt of information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to
the POTW, to City, WRA or operating contractor personnel, or to the receiving water;
(5) Upon occurrence of a violation of any terms or conditions of the permit;
(6) Misrepresentation of, or grant of variance from, such categorical standards pursuant

(b) The filing of a request by the permittee for permit modification, revocation and reissuance,
termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance shall not have the
effect of staying or delaying the implementation or effective date of any permit condition.
Sec. 204-109. Permit transfer.
An industrial wastewater discharge permit is not transferable to any other person or entity. A new
owner or operator must apply for a new wastewater discharge permit 60 days prior to taking
ownership or undertaking operation of a permitted facility.
43
Sec. 204-110. Denial of permit.
The WRA director may deny a wastewater discharge permit to any user whose discharge of material
to the POTW, whether shown upon application, including test results submitted by the applicant, or
determined after inspection or testing conducted by the WRA or its operating contractor, is not in
conformity with this article or whose application is incomplete or does not comply with the
requirements of section 204-103 of this division.
Sec. 204-111. Permit violations.
Any violation of the terms, conditions, or limits of a user's wastewater discharge permit shall be
deemed a violation of this article and shall subject the user to all enforcement procedures outlined in
this article.
Sec. 204-112. Periodic compliance reports.
Under this division, periodic compliance reports are required as follows:
(1) Significant users shall submit to the WRA director, during the months of January and
July, a report indicating the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by permit or pretreatment standards for the preceding six-month period.
This report shall include a record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow for each
analysis date during the reporting period. At the discretion of the WRA director and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc.,
the WRA director may agree to alter the months during which the reports are to be
submitted. More frequent reports may be required by the WRA director.
(2) The WRA director may impose mass limitations on users. In such cases, the report
required by subsection (1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. All analyses shall be performed using
Environmental Protection Agency approved methods using sampling techniques approved
by the Iowa department of natural resources.
(3) Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements in section 204-113 of
this division for each report submitted under this section. Where the WRA itself collects all
the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be
required to submit a periodic compliance report.
(4) A user must notify the WRA director of all violations identified as a result of selfmonitoring
to the POTW by telephone, during normal business hours, within 24 hours of the
time the user becomes aware of such violation. The user must also submit the results of
repeat analyses to the WRA within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, together
with a complete report on all steps taken to resolve the violation. The user need not repeat
the analyses if:
44
a. The WRA performs sampling of the industrial user at a frequency of at least
once per month; or
b. The WRA performs sampling of the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this
sampling.
c. The City of Waukee would prefer 24-hour composite sampling not grab
samples.
(5) A user who monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the WRA or
who self-monitors in addition to WRA monitoring, using Environmental Protection Agency
methods or standard methods, shall report the monitoring results to the WRA director in
accordance with subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section.
Sec. 204-113. Certification and signatory requirements.
(a) All applications or reports submitted by a user pursuant to this division shall contain the
following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under
my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of
the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing
violations."
(b) All applications and reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user as
defined in section 204-316 of this article. A user shall maintain a current and accurate authorization
on file with the WRA director.
Sec. 204-114. Monitoring facilities.
(a) When required by the WRA director pursuant to this division, each permitted user shall at its
expense provide and operate monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems. The WRA director may require the
placement of such monitoring facilities at the end of each process where pollutants are used,
produced, or treated. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(b) When required by the wastewater discharge permit and within 90 days of written
notification, a user shall install a sampling chamber for each separate discharge of the building
sewer in accordance with plans and specification approved by the WRA director. A user shall
provide ample room in or near such sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and preparation
45
of samples for analysis. Each user shall at its expense maintain all sampling and measuring
equipment in a safe and proper operating condition at all times, which equipment shall be safely,
easily and independently accessible to authorized representatives of the WRA. Users shall certify all
flow measuring devices to be in proper working condition at a frequency specified in the permit or
in writing by the WRA director, using a qualified technician acceptable to the WRA director.
Sampling shall be in accordance with the following:
(1) Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless another device is approved by
the WRA director, with a recording and totalizing device for measurement of the liquid
quantity.
(2) At the discretion of the WRA director, metered water supply to a user may be used
as the volume quantity where it is substantiated that the metered water supply and waste
quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the
director is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate
meters may be used to subtract water which is not discharged to the POTW or is discharged
to a sewer other than the sampled location.
(3) Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume determined by the WRA director
and shall be properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance with Environmental
Protection Agency approved methods. The sample shall be composited in proportion to the
flow for a representative 24-hour sample. A time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used
if flow proportioned sampling is determined by the WRA director to be impractical. Grab
samples shall be used where appropriate.
(c) A user must inform the WRA director prior to breaking a sampler seal, used by the WRA to
detect sample tampering, unless necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage. A user shall not place additional seals or locks upon a sampler which may be used by the
WRA without first obtaining approval from the WRA director.
Sec. 204-115. Inspection, sampling and recordkeeping authority.
Under this division, users shall be deemed to have given the following authorities to the WRA and
its operating contractor:
(1) Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents of the WRA to enter upon all
properties and all parts of the premises, or upon properties of users with wastewater
discharge permits, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, records
copying, or the performance of any of their duties. This shall include the right to set up, on
the user's property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring, or metering operations as may be required in pursuance of the
implementation and enforcement of this article.
(2) Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements in the security measures so that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
46
WRA or operating contractor personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
(3) All users subject to any of the reporting requirements of this article shall maintain
copies of reports and records of all information as required in 40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting
from any monitoring activities required by this article for a minimum of three years and
shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the WRA and its operating
contractor. This period of retention shall be extended until the completion of any unresolved
negotiation, hearing, or litigation involving a purported violation.
Sec. 204-116. Confidential documents, data and information.
(a) Except as provided in this section, documents, data and information obtained from user
reports, questionnaires, permit applications and inspections pursuant to this division shall be made
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction. If the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate that the release of such information would divulge information
concerning processes or methods of production entitled to protection under law as trade secrets of
the user or would give advantage to competitors and serve no public purpose, the WRA director
may determine that such information should be kept confidential and not made available for public
examination, but such information shall be available to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
or the Iowa department of natural resources.
(b) Decisions by the WRA director to deny confidential status for information may be appealed
using the procedures in section 204-117 of this division. In determining whether information is
confidential, the provisions of I.C. ch. 22 shall prevail.
(c) Effluent data and enforcement actions by the WRA or its operating contractor will not be
considered confidential records or information.
Sec. 204-117. Appeal of denial of confidential status.
(a) Any person aggrieved by the WRA director's decision to release information or data
obtained as provided in subsection 204-116(a) of this division and who can demonstrate a direct and
substantial interest in the information or data sought to be kept confidential may appeal the WRA
director's decision. A request for appeal shall be filed in writing with the WRA director not less than
five days after the WRA director's decision to deny confidential status to such information or data.

resulting from spill clean-up.
Sec. 204-212. License.
No waste hauler shall remove waste from within the corporate limits of the city or shall
dispose of waste, whether from a source inside or outside the corporate limits, into the POTW
without first obtaining a waste hauler license from the WRA, with the following exceptions:
(1) WRA participating communities that operate vehicles to remove waste from
municipal sewer systems.
(2) Waste haulers hired by WRA participating communities to remove waste from
municipal sewer systems and which bring no other wastes to the WRF.
(3) Waste haulers utilized by industrial users issued a wastewater discharge permit by
the WRA.
(4) Waste haulers granted temporary authorization by the WRA director in order to deal
with an emergency.
Sec. 204-213. Issuance of license.
The waste hauler's license shall be issued by the WRA director upon written application that
shall consist of the following minimum requirements:

license holder, stating the location, date, and time the rejected load was disposed of. The
statement is due within five calendar days after the waste is rejected.
(b) A vehicle used to haul rejected wastes shall not thereafter be allowed to dispose of
additional wastes at the WRF until the statement required by this section is delivered to the WRA
director.
Sec. 204-220. Treatment fees for hauled wastes.
(a) A treatment fee shall be charged per pound of hauled waste received at the WRF for all
wastes originating within WRA participating communities which are treated through the
headwork’s at the WRF using all treatment processes at the WRF, which fee shall be equal to the
cost of disposal and treatment of an equivalent volume and mass of pollutants otherwise delivered
into the POTW. The treatment fee shall include: (1) the volume charge component, (2) a treatment
surcharge component for each pollutant as found in section 204-72 of this division, and (3) a
program cost component. The program cost component shall be calculated by dividing the annual
administrative costs of the waste hauler program by the total gallons of hauled waste treated in the
previous calendar year. The surcharge component shall be calculated using the average
concentration of pollutants found in hauled wastes delivered to the wastewater reclamation facility.
The treatment surcharge and program cost components shall be reviewed and updated annually
based on the most recent data collected by the operating agency. The treatment fee for loads
originating outside the corporate limits of the WRA participating communities shall be 1.5 times the
fee for loads originating within the WRA participating communities.
(b) A treatment fee shall be charged for hauled wastes originating within the corporate limits of
the WRA participating communities which are treated using only a portion of the treatment
processes at the WRF, which fee shall be calculated to recover the cost of treatment. The cost of
treatment shall include electrical, chemical, personnel, and any capital costs associated with the
71
treatment processes utilized, and a program cost component which shall be calculated by dividing
the annual administrative costs of the waste hauler program associated with partial process
treatment by the total gallons of hauled waste treated using only a portion of the treatment processes
in the previous calendar year. Treatment costs shall be reviewed and updated annually based on the
most recent data collected by the operating agency. The treatment fee for loads originating outside
the corporate limits of the WRA participating communities shall be 1.5 times the fee for loads
originating within the WRA participating communities.
(c) Fees shall be computed and recorded at the disposal station and shall be paid by the waste
hauler on the basis of monthly billings by the operating contractor. Limits of credit shall not exceed
60 days. Abuse of such credit shall be grounds for liability on the waste hauler's bond and for
refusal of disposal services to any waste hauler under this division.
(d) Waste haulers may elect to have their loads tested for actual concentration at their expense
as set out in section 204-72. When a waste hauler has elected to have loads tested for actual
concentration, the treatment fee will be based on the actual concentration whether it is higher or
lower than the average concentration treatment fee. Said testing will be done at least once a month
or more often as required by the WRA director.

“POST CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER MANAGEMENT” ESTABLISHING THE
RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR POST CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER
MANAGEMENT CONCERNING PROPERTY WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS
OF THE CITY OF WAUKEE, IOWA
204D.1 PURPOSE
1. The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”)
permit program (“Program”) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4).
The City’s MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the city clerk and is available for
public inspection during regular office hours.
2. As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to develop,
implement, and enforce a program to address storm water runoff from new
construction and reconstruction projects for which State NPDES General Permit
#2 storm water permit coverage is required by adopting a POSTCONSTRUCTION
STORM WATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE designed:
(a) To require water quality and quantity components be considered in the
design of new construction and implemented when practical; and
(b) To promote the use of storm water detention and retention, grass swales,
buffer strips, and proper operation and maintenance of these facilities; and
(c) To allow use of bio-retention swales and riparian buffers where practical
and the soils and topography are suitable to ensure such measures will be
effective in accomplishing the purpose of this ordinance; and
(d) To prohibit construction activities from commencing until the plans for
post-construction runoff controls have been submitted to the City; and
(e) To allow the City to have the ability to access private property for the
purpose of enforcement procedures to promote compliance with the State
NPDES General Permits #2 which require post-construction compliance
by Applicants (“Applicants”).
3. No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City with
inspections, monitoring and/or enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City
shall fund its inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities entirely by
fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the Program
by virtue of state and federal law, and/or other sources of funding established by a
separate ordinance.
2
4. Terms used in this ordinance shall have the meanings specified as follows:
(a) “Applicant” means any person, firm, or entity applying for a permit to
develop, grade, or construct within the corporate limits of the City.
(b) The definitions provided in section 204A.1 of the Waukee Municipal
Code are incorporated herein by this reference.
204D.2 PROCEDURE FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION
1. Each Applicant who is required to have coverage under General Permit No. 2 for
a site shall install post-construction storm water management facilities as set forth
herein and as approved by the City during site plan, platting, or construction
plans.
2. Each Applicant or its successor person(s) or entity shall be responsible for
maintaining all storm water management facilities as approved by the City.
3. For sites equal to or greater than one acre, each Applicant must provide to the
City as-built plans detailing dimensions and elevations as well as a certification
that storm water management facilities were built as part of the approved
development that includes the site. For sites less than one acre that are part of a
common plan of development and for which the Applicant establishes that storm
water management facilities were or will be built to address all properties (either
collectively or individually) within the development, each Applicant must provide

facilities that will convey drainage through the property to one or more detention
and/or treatment areas such that no development shall cause downstream property
owners, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive storm water runoff from
the proposed development site at a peak flow rate greater than that allowed by the

requirements as they apply to the City or to the property.

execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all
subsequent owners of land served by the storm water management facility. The
agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic
inspection by the City, or its contractor or agent, to ensure that the facility is
maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other
provisions established by this ordinance. The easement agreement shall be
recorded by the City in the land records.
2. Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be ensured through
the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the City

covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will
occur to ensure proper function of the storm water management facility. The
covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections by the Applicant,
owner, or assigns to ensure proper performance of the facility.
3. The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect any property subject to regulation
under this section as often as is necessary to document maintenance and repair
needs and determine compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. If a
Responsible Party owning, controlling or possessing a property has security
measures that require identification and clearance before entry to its property,
such Responsible Party shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access by
the City. By way of specification but not limitation:
(a) A Responsible Party shall allow the City ready access to all parts of the
property for purposes of inspection, examination, and copying of records
related to compliance with this ordinance.
(b) Any temporary or permanent obstruction that obstructs the safe and easy
access to property to be inspected and shall be promptly removed by the
Responsible Party at the written or oral order of the City and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
Responsible Party.
(c) An unreasonable delay in allowing the City access to a property is a
violation of this chapter.
4
4. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water
management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance
and repairs, and shall retain said records. Copies of the as-built plans and records
of all self inspections, maintenance, and repairs shall be kept on-site and shall be
made available to the City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable
times upon request.
5. In the event that a storm water management facility is found by the City to be
non-compliant with the plans as submitted and approved or is found to be in need
of maintenance, the responsible party will be notified in writing of such
deficiencies. Upon receipt of such notice, the responsible party shall have fifteen
(15) days to correct such deficiencies. After proper notice, and if the responsible
party fails to make the repairs or perform the maintenance, the City may have
such work performed and assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair
work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or
prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax
bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the City. In addition, easements and
covenants recorded upon the applicants property shall provide mechanisms for the
establishment of a lien by the City for any and all costs incurred by the City
pursuant to this chapter to aid in the efficient and cost effective collection of sums
so expended, including, but not limited to, attorneys fees associated with
collection.
204D.4 ENFORCEMENT BY LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION

AN ORDINANCE GOVERNING THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF
COMMUNICATION TOWERS IN THE CITY OF WAUKEE, IOWA.
§221.1 Telecommunications Ordinance. This ordinance shall be known and may be
cited and referred to as the “Telecommunications Ordinance” of the City of Waukee, Iowa, and shall be
referred to herein as “this ordinance.”
§221.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish general guidelines for the
location or siting of telecommunication towers and equipment. The goal of this chapter is to encourage the
location of communication towers and equipment in areas of the city which would be least adversely
impacted by the visual, aesthetic and safety implications of their siting; minimize the number of towers
throughout the city; strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites; and enhance the ability
of the providers of telecommunication services to provide such services to the community quickly, efficiently
and effectively.
Section 221.3 Requirements. The following criteria will be consistently
applied to all telecommunication providers that request a permit to do business in the City
of Waukee:
A. Communication towers are permitted in C-1 or M zoning districts.
1. A site plan is required for all new communication tower and
equipment facility construction, expansion of existing facilities or major
modifications of existing facilities. The following must be included as part
of the site plan and telecommunication development request:
a. Map showing the location of the applicant’s proposed
facility and any existing facilities within three miles of the proposed
site.
b. Report from a structural engineer showing the tower
antennae capacity by type and number and a certification that the
tower is designed to withstand winds in accordance with
ANS/EIA/TIA 222, latest revision, standards.
c. Evidence that a valid FCC license for the proposed
activity has been issued.
d. A written agreement signed by the communication facility
owner and property owner to remove the tower and any other
equipment within sixty (60) days after abandonment. As used
herein, the term ‘abandonment’ shall mean that the communication
tower has not been used for its intended and approved purpose
for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
e. Establish that the use of and frequencies emitted from the
2
tower and equipment will not interfere with the transmissions of
law enforcement, fire, emergency response, public works, or other
service agencies.
f. Additional information as required to determine that all
applicable zoning and siting regulations are met.
2. Communication towers and equipment must meet the following
design standards:
a. Communication towers shall be set back from all property
lines and all other principle structures a distance not less than one
half of the tower’s height, unless a tower is adjacent to a
commercial or residential district or a city park, in which case the
tower will be set back a distance not less than the full tower’s
height.
b. Communication towers shall have a maximum height of
forty-five (45) feet.
c. When possible towers shall be located atop existing
structures (i.e. water tower or co-op grain tower) or disguised as
other objects that better blend in with the local environment.
d. Communication towers that are not located atop another
structure as recommended in 3-c shall be disguised to reduce the
visual impact of typical tower installations. Appearance of the
tower must be approved by staff.
e. Lights and signage shall not be permitted on any tower
unless specifically required and permitted by the Federal
Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration or
the City of Waukee.
f. Security fencing, eight feet in height, shall surround the
communication towers, equipment facilities and guy wires.
g. Communication tower equipment facilities and accessory
structures shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with
the surrounding area.
h. Communication tower facilities mounted to a building wall
shall be painted to blend with the color and materials of the
surface to which it is attached. All wiring and accessory
equipment shall be concealed from view. Communication facilities
located above the roof of the structure shall be appropriately
screened from view through use of panels, walls, fences or other
screening techniques approved by the City.
3. Providers may be required to co-locate and enter into co-location
agreements to minimize the overall number of towers within the city.
a. All new communication towers, and any pre-existing
3
communication towers, owned by a licensed carrier, upon which
this chapter permits co-location of additional communication
facilities, shall be made available for use by the owner or initial use
thereof, together with as many other licensed carriers as can be
technically co-located thereon. However, nothing in this chapter
shall prevent licensed carriers from charging a reasonable fee for
the co-location of additional communication facilities upon said
tower, which does not exceed the fair market value of the space
occupied.
b. All licensed carriers shall cooperate with each other in colocating
additional communication facilities upon such towers. All
licensed carriers shall exercise good faith in co-locating with other
licensed carriers and in the sharing of towers, including technical
information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location. This
covenant of good faith and fair dealing shall be a condition of any
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for a new communication
tower.
4. Communication towers and equipment shall meet or exceed the
current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration
and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to
regulate communication towers and equipment.
C. The Community Development Director is authorized to submit a
telecommunication development application to an independent technical expert to
review any technical materials submitted including, but not limited to, those required
in this chapter. The applicant shall pay all reasonable costs of this review, including
any administrative costs incurred by the City. Any proprietary information
disclosed to the City or to the technical expert hired shall remain confidential and
shall not be disclosed to any third party.

utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing sanitary sewer facilities or
water system facilities in those instances in which a significant number of the
properties to be benefited by such facilities are not sufficiently developed to permit
the recovery of those costs through the special assessment process as provided in
Chapter 384, Division IV of the Iowa Code. The City hereby declares its intent to
utilize connection fees, as herein provided, to recover the costs of designing and
constructing such sanitary sewer facilities or water system facilities from property
owners who connect to such facilities subsequent to their construction.
It is the intent of this section to set forth the method of recovery of proportional cost
shares from those property owners who connect their properties to sanitary sewer
facilities or water system facilities subsequent to their construction, so that in the
event that all property, other than the City right-of-way, which lies within the
benefited district is connected to the sanitary sewer facilities or water system
facilities during their expected useful life, then those properties shall bear, in the
aggregate, up to 100% of the cost of designing and constructing such facilities,
including legal and administrative expenses associated therewith, and interest
thereon.
B. In the event the City Council has determined the necessity of constructing a sanitary
sewer facility or water system facility, and the owner or owners of tract of land
outside the assessment district of said sanitary sewer facility or water system facility
desire connection thereto, and the City determines that the utilization of a connection
fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City's costs associated
therewith, the City Council shall proceed in compliance with §384.38, Code of
Iowa, and as follows:
1. The City shall cause a "Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption
of an Ordinance to Establish a "Connection Fee District" to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City as hereafter provided. In
addition to indicating the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the
notice shall:
2
2. Indicate the nature and extent of the sanitary sewer facility or water system
facilities constructed to which the tract or tracts in the connection fee district
is to be connected, as well as the estimated costs or costs for the design and
construction of same;
3. Identify by general description the proposed connection fee district to be
served by the sanitary sewer facility or facilities; and
4. Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by property
owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities, expressed
in dollars per acre of land area served for single family residential housing.
Connection fees will be adjusted upward for higher volume users.
C. At the public hearing, the owners or occupants of properties within the proposed
connection fee district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
1. the necessity for connection to the sanitary sewer facility or water system
facility;
2. the calculation of the area benefited by the connection fee district;
3. the estimated costs of the facilities to which the tract or tracts in the proposed
connection fee district or districts is to be connected; and
4. the proposed connection fee as to each tract or lot in each tract.
Upon concluding the hearing, the City Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the proposed Ordinance to Establish
a Connection Fee District. Upon consideration of the proposed Ordinance to
Establish a Connection Fee District, the City may:
1. Create the connection fee district as proposed and affirm the proposed
connection fee.
2. Alter the proposed connection fee district or the proposed connection fee; or
3. Make any other provision relative to the proposed connection fee district or
connection fee which the council determines to be equitable in the premises.
D. The Ordinance to Establish a Connection Fee District may provide, at the City
Council's discretion, that single family residences within the connection fee district,
in existence or under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and
located within the corporate limits of the City of Waukee, are eligible for connection
to the sanitary sewer facilities or water system facilities. In that event, the ordinance
shall include the following provisions:
3
1. That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in size located
within the City of Waukee may connect such residences to the sanitary sewer
facility or water system facility upon approval of their application for
connection, payment of connection fees for the parcel, and construction of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City
Engineer; and
2. That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in size located
within the City of Waukee may connect such residences to the sanitary sewer
facility or water system facility upon approval of their application for
connection, subdivision of said parcel into a residence parcel and an outlot,
payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and construction of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City
Engineer.
All other property located within the corporate limits of the City of Waukee and
within a connection fee district shall be eligible for connection to the sanitary sewer
facility or water system facility upon approval of an application for connection by
the owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such
property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and provided that all sanitary sewer improvements or water system
improvements necessary to serve said property have been constructed and approved
by the City. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, the City may
refuse connection if, in the opinion of the City engineer, the facilities are not capable
of handling the additional flows from such proposed connection district.
E. After adoption and publication of an Ordinance to Establish a Connection Fee
District, the owners of those properties within said district whose properties are
eligible for connection, and who propose to connect such properties directly or
indirectly to the sanitary sewer facility or water system facility, shall make
application to the City Administrator for such connection. No connection shall be
made to a sanitary sewer facility or water system facility until such application has
been approved and until the required connection fee has been paid.
F. The connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum acre area of
contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the connection fee district under such
ownership which can be lawfully served through such proposed connection,
multiplied by the per acre connection fee established in the Ordinance to Establish a
Connection Fee District for that district. Provided, however, connection fees will be
adjusted upward for higher volume users. Said ordinance may provide for a
graduated connection fee, with annual interest adjustments, such that property
owners who connect in later years pay interest on the connection fee for their
property. The rate of interest applicable to the connection fee established in each
connection fee district shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable to special
assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3) of the Iowa Code in
4
effect on the date that the connection fee was established for that district by
enactment of Ordinance to Establish a Connection Fee District.
G. The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this section is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees for connection required under the
plumbing code or other provisions of the Waukee Municipal Code.
H. In the event any property owner connects his or her property to a sanitary sewer
facility or a water system facility without having made application therefor or
without having received approval thereof, or without having paid the required
connection fee established by an Ordinance to Establish a Connection Fee District,
the City shall be entitled to disconnect such private sewer or water connection until
such time as the property owner has made and received approval of his or her
application, and/or has paid the required connection fee.

as approved by the auditor, for the county in which the plat lies. The plat shall include an
accurate description of the land included in the subdivision and shall give reference to
two section corners within the United States public land survey system in which the plat
lies or, if the plat is a subdivision of any portion of an official plat, two established
monuments within the official plat. Each lot within the plat shall be assigned a
progressive number or letter designation approved by the County Auditor. Streets, alleys,
parks, open areas, school property, other areas of public use, or areas within the plat that
are set aside for future development shall be assigned a progressive letter and shall have
the proposed use clearly designated. A strip of land shall not be reserved by the
Subdivider unless the land is of sufficient size and shape to be of practical use or service
as determined by the governing body. Progressive block numbers or letters may be
assigned to groups of lots separated from other lots by streets or other physical features of
the land. The surveyor shall not assign lot numbers or letters to a lot shown within a
subdivision plat unless the lot has been surveyed by the surveyor in compliance with
Chapter 355 Code of Iowa, as amended. The county auditor may note a permanent real
estate index number upon each lot within a subdivision plat. Sufficient information,
including dimensions and angles or bearings, shall be shown on the plat to accurately
establish the boundaries of each lot, street, and easement. Easements necessary for the
orderly development of the land within the plat shall be shown and the purpose of the
easements shall be clearly stated.

land survey system and not entirely within an official plat, lies within more than one
forty-acre aliquot part of a section, the acreage shall be shown only for assessment and
taxation purposes for the portion of the subdivision that lies within each forty-acre aliquot
part of the section. The area of the irregular lots within the plat shall be shown and may
be expressed in either acres, to the nearest one- hundredth acre, or square feet, to the
nearest ten square feet. The surveyor shall not be required to establish the location of a
forty-acre 1/4 section line (1/4 of 1/4 section) by survey but is required to use reasonable
assumption in determining its approximate location for assessment and taxation purposes.

ARTICLE VI
§303.9. Pre-application Procedure.
§303.10. Before subdividing any tract of land and previous to the filing of
an application for conditional approval of the Preliminary Plat, the Sub-divider should
meet with the City Planning and Zoning Commission and discuss the plans. Plans and
data should be presented to the Commission as specified in Article VII, Section 303.28,
303.29, 303.30 and 303.31 of this ordinance. This step does not require formal
application, fee or filing of plat with the Commission.
§303.11. Advice to Sub-divider.
The purpose of the “Pre-application Procedure” is to afford the Sub-divider an
opportunity to meet and receive the advice and assistance of the Commission, and to
consult early and informally with the Commission before preparation of the preliminary
plat and before formal application for its approval, in order to save time and money and
to make the most of the Sub-divider’s opportunities.
The Sub-divider should also consult with parties potentially interested with the
Sub-divider or with the ultimate users of the development, such as lending and mortgage
insurance institutions, with a view to reaching, at this initial stage, firm conclusions
regarding what part of the marked demand should be served, the suitability of the
location of the proposed subdivision, the most advantageous subdivision plan, the
arrangement of streets, lots and other features of the proposed development.
Either at the time of meeting or within fifteen (15) days after such meeting and
discussion, the Commission shall inform the Sub-divider that the plans and data, as
submitted or as modified, do or do not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the
Commission finds the plans and data do not meet the objective of these regulations, it
shall express its reasons therefor.
A. Limitations on Building on Subdivided Land Within the City of Waukee.
Subdivisions of land within the City of Waukee may allow multiple ownership of
parcels of land (lots) within a larger tract of land originally under single
ownership. Each lot has limitations of use and some lots may not be suitable for
erection of dwellings or ancillary buildings. Notwithstanding compliance with all
local zoning requirements and City ordinances, each lot is subject to limitations of
use by Federal, State and local laws – limitations by lack of available central
wastewater collection system or suitable on site individual disposal system, lack
of service by utility companies, unstable soils, old coal mines, waterways and
floodways, wetlands, groundwater, environmental limitations, or other natural or
man-made features which, known or unknown, to the City Building Inspector
may cause a health or safety concern for the potential occupants of the lot.
Individuals who purchase a lot within a subdivision, or a partial lot caused by the
division of a lot within a subdivision assume all risk in determining the suitability
2
of the use of such lot for building purposes. A copy of this ordinance shall be
included in each plat for which approval is requested in the City of Waukee.

Engineer.

disapproval shall be remedied prior to further consideration. The plat shall not be
approved and construction shall not begin until the plans and specifications for necessary
improvements have been reviewed by the City Engineer and approved by the City
Council.

ARTICLE XII
Development Impact on Community Facilities
§303.156. Purpose. This ordinance is enacted to insure that land is properly located and
preserved and community facilities provided to accommodate future community growth; and to further
insure that the cost of providing the community facilities necessary to serve the additional residents
brought into the community through subdivision development may be most equitable apportioned on the
basis of the additional public requirements created by such subdivision development.
§303.157. Park Site Dedication and Reservation. This ordinance is required to ensure the
reservation of well-located and appropriately sized open spaces. Park areas must be created and preserved
in adequate quantity to provide access to all citizens as the community continues to grow. Further, these
spaces must be provided for by the subdivision development that creates the demand.
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or a site plan, each Subdivider or developer shall
be required to dedicate land without cost to the City for park and recreational purposes to serve the
immediate and future needs of the neighborhood, in accordance with the following criteria:
A. Park, Recreation Acres, and Open Space Dedication. In the design of the
SUBDIVISION PLAT OR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD), dedication of
land and/or physical improvement of the neighborhood park system shall be required by
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council as to all subdivisions.
1. Procedure. At the time of filing a preliminary plat or site plan with the City, staff
will calculate the amount of needed park space (based upon the park service ratio,
which is explained in Section C). Staff will work with the developer to ensure that
the dedicated land is useable and, where possible, ties into other park space or trail
connections.
B. Determination of Land Dedication for Park, Recreation Areas, and Open Spaces.
The amount of land required to be dedicated by a Subdivider pursuant to this Article shall
be a function of the following:
1. Acres in development
2. Development capacity established by the development’s zoning.
3. Number of people per unit in the City of Waukee, with differentiation between
single-family and multi-family residences.
4. The City of Waukee’s desired level of service standard in acres of neighborhood
park per 1,000 persons.
The following will be used by the staff to determine what land shall be dedicated:
1. The Waukee Comprehensive Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan
2. The topography, geology, access, and location of land in the subdivision that is
suitable for the development of neighborhood and community parks
3. The City’s policies for development of neighborhood and community parks
4. The size and shape of the subject property and land available for dedication
5. The location of existing or proposed park sites and trails
2
The Comprehensive Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan describes the level of service
standards that the City of Waukee will pursue. Waukee seeks to maintain a level of service
of 6.00 acres per 1000 people. This figure reflects a continuation of the City of Waukee’s
existing standard. When possible, parcels should be aggregated to provide for
neighborhood parks of approximately seven (7) acres each.
Land Use Category Total Development

High Density/Multi-
Family
1392 1.75 0.58
Mobile Home 394 2.5 0.83
The number of planned dwelling units of each type, multiplied by the appropriate
dedication for that housing type, when added together for the Development Concept area,
is the revenue available to fund the purchase of all the neighborhood parks as identified on
the Development Concept. The appropriate dedication is determined by household size
and can be expressed as a proportion of the single-family fee as listed on the table above.
C. Calculation of Required Dedication
Number of units of a particular type multiplied by the persons per household yields the
number of persons within the development. This figure is multiplied by the service level
of 6.00 and the product divided by 1000 to yield the demand created in acres.
400 Single Family units x 3 Persons/Household = 1200 Persons
1200 x 6.00 = 7200 / 1000 = 7.2 Acres
D. Site Improvements
In addition to the dedication of land this ordinance requires the provision of initial
development for neighborhood parks. The following will be required of any development
adjacent to a neighborhood park.
Reasonable improvements and access to the land dedicated, including full street
improvements and utility connections such as curbs, gutters, street paving and traffic
control devices.
On site improvements including grading and seeding shall be required.
E. Number and Type of Units Designated
1. The Subdivider shall designate on the Plat map the maximum number of dwelling
units for the subdivision. Subdividers of condominiums, apartment projects or
cooperative projects shall designate the maximum number of dwelling units for the
purposes of this chapter only, and such designation shall not constitute approval of
3
the design or location of the units. If the number is not designated, the total
number of dwelling units shall be the maximum number of such units permitted by
the existing zoning.
2. The Subdivider shall designate on the Plat Map the dwelling unit type of each
dwelling. If the dwelling unit type is not designated then that which yields the
highest subdivision population shall be used to determine dedications.
3. If at any time the Subdivider or Developer wishes to change the density he must
provide the City with a new Plat Map detailing the changes. If the density is
increased, the extra dedication amounts will be calculated and will be due before
the changes can be approved. Should the density be lowered, arrangements will be
made to return dedicated property provided that it has not yet been developed as
park space.
F. Credits and Deferment
1. Credit for Private Amenities: A credit may be issued up to the entire amount of the
required park dedication for permanent recreational facilities, amenities and land in
private developments wherein said facilities and amenities are available for
common use, without rental charge, by local residents.
The credit against the dedication shall be determined by taking the total value of the
recreational facilities and amenities provided within the private development for
common use, without rental charge, by residents within the development and
relating them to park needs as described in the Waukee Comprehensive Park,
Recreation and Open Space Plan. Credit available will depend upon the relation
between the provided amenities and the stated park needs in the plan.
Recreational facilities and amenities which are to be considered in establishing a
credit include, but are not limited to, swimming pools, wading pools, court games
facilities, athletic field apparatus and playground equipment.
No credit shall be given after 24 months from the date of the dedication.
2. Deferment for Residential Care Committee
Residential Care Facilities that meet the requirements of this section shall be
eligible for deferment of the obligation under other portions of this ordinance.
In order to receive deferment of the parkland dedication requirements a Residential
Care Facility must meet the following requirements.
a. One hundred percent of the residential units included in the Facility must be
covered by the license issued by the State of Iowa to provide care to nonambulatory
elderly residents prior to occupancy of the first unit.
b. The Facility must provide the following care and have the following
attributes:
1. Assistance in dressing, grooming, bathing and other personal hygiene;
2. Assistance with taking medication;
4
3. Central storing and distribution of medication;
4. Arrangement of and assistance with medical and dental care, including
transportation of residents to doctor or dentist appointments;

Recreation and Open Space Plan, the park site shall be schematically and
dimensionally located and a schedule determined between the City and the
Developer for the acquisition of the park site by the City.
When a final plat or site plan has been submitted to the City for approval, and it has
been determined that land shall be reserved for acquisition by the City for park use,
the location and final accurate dimensions of the park site shall be shown in detail
and legal description provided by the developer for accurate transfer of ownership.
Plans for development of the park site shall be prepared by the City to establish
accurate dimensions and acreage of the parcel to be acquired by the City.

A, A1-30, AE, AH, AO, AR, and/or A99.
START OF CONSTRUCTION - Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement, was within 180
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement or permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of
pile, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
5
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the

"start of construction" of the improvement, or (ii) if the structure has been
"substantially damaged" and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and
which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. The term also
does not include any alteration of an "historic structure", provided the alteration will
not preclude the structure's designation as an "historic structure".
2. Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by 25 percent or
more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the first floodplain
management regulations adopted by the community shall be added to any proposed
addition in determining whether the total increase in original floor space would
exceed 25 percent.

§306.2. Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact and Purpose.
A. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and
to promote health and the general welfare.
B. Findings of Fact
1. The flood hazard areas of the City of Waukee are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
2. These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by: (i) The
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create
hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected
from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
3. This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards
which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of Natural
Resources.
C. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property
of the City of Waukee and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health,
welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section 306.2(B) 1 of this Ordinance with provisions designed to:
1. Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood
heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
2. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of
flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.
3. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or
substantial improvement.
4. Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes
because of flood hazard.
7
5. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to
purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.

(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of the
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
2. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration of the effects
of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
3. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
19
4. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for
buildings than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance, the applicant shall be
notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i) the issuance of
a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction
increases risks to life and property.
5. All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Department of
Natural Resources.

1. Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an Appeal or a request
for a Variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by
agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed
necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department
of Natural Resources.
2. Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an Appeal or Variance within a
reasonable time. In passing upon an Appeal, the Board may, so long as such
action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm,
wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings
of fact and the reasons for its decision. In granting a Variance, the board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of
this ordinance and may prescribe such conditions as contained in Section 306.9
(D) 2 (B).
A. Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall be
Based. In passing upon applications for Variances, the Board shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this Ordinance and:
1. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
2. The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
3. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
20
4. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
5. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.

floodplain management program for the area.
10. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
11. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
12. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
13. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this Ordinance.
B Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this Ordinance.
Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
1. Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
2. Limitation of periods of use and operation.
3. Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.

protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors
associated with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall
require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are
consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated
flood factors for the particular area.

§401.5. Violations.
A. Enforcement. The creation or maintenance of a violation of this ordinance is

such violations in accordance with the procedures of this Code and to
serve notice to abate same, whether upon the owner or other
responsible party for a premises upon which a violation is being
maintained, or upon the person or persons causing or maintaining the
violation.
2. The objective of this Code being the abatement of violations, persons
violating this Code shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to
voluntarily remedy the violation before action to assess costs or
penalties for a violation is undertaken. Consideration will be given to
evidence of a good faith effort to correct the violation; whether an
imminent health or safety hazard exists; whether the person has
previously been notified of or charged with violations of a similar nature;
and other factors.
3. Violations which are not voluntarily remedied may be abated by an
administrative abatement process; the municipal infraction process; by
court proceedings; or by City abatement and assessment of costs
therefore against the responsible party, at the discretion of the City.
4. The enforcement officer may, but shall not be required to, give
notice to abate prior to issuance of a civil citation for a repeat offense
involving the same property and occurring within a year of a prior
violation and notice to abate.

B. Notice. When service of a notice to abate is required, the following
methods of service shall be deemed adequate:
1. By personal service upon the owner or other responsible party of the
property upon which the nuisance exists, or upon the person or persons
causing or maintaining the violation.
2. If, after reasonable effort, personal service cannot be made, any two of
the following methods of service shall be considered adequate: (a)
sending the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the last
known address; (b) publishing the notice once a week for two
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of
Waukee, Iowa; or (c) by posting the notice in a conspicuous place on
the property or building deemed as nuisance.
C. Appeal. Any person affected by any notice to abate a violation of this
Code may request a hearing on the matter before the Board of Appeals,
provided that a written appeal shall be filed with the Enforcement Officer within
ten days after the notice to abate was served. The appeal shall be filed on a
form provided by the City for that purpose, and shall state the particular section
of the ordinance or interpretation thereof being appealed, and a brief statement
of the grounds upon which such appeal is taken. Failure to file a timely appeal
as prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing, and the
notice shall become final.
The Board's determination and order shall be appealable to the County District
Court by writ of certiorari. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days
from the date of the Board's decision. The Board's order shall not be carried
out until the time for filing the writ of certiorari has expired.
D. Abatement Remedies and Penalties. In the event that the violation is not
abated as ordered and within the time specified, the City may abate such
violation by any of the following means:
1. By undertaking such abatement and assessing the costs therefore
against the property.
2. By issuance of a civil citation charging the owner or responsible
party with a municipal violation.
Abatement may include but is not limited to repair, removal, cleaning,
extermination, cutting mowing, grading, sewer repairs, draining, securing,

portions thereof, and elimination of nuisances. Abatement costs may include the
cost of removing or eliminating the violation; the costs of investigation, such as
title searches, inspection, and testing; the cost of notification; filing costs; and
other related administrative costs. Inoperable or obsolete vehicles which have
been impounded may be sold in accordance with state law. If an inoperable or
obsolete vehicle is not sold or if the proceeds of such sale or redemption are not
sufficient to pay the costs of abatement, storage, and sale of said inoperable or
obsolete vehicle, such cost of abatement, storage, and sale of said inoperable or
obsolete vehicle, such cost or the balance of such cost may be assessed against
the premises in the same manner as a property tax.
Before the assessment of any charges for work done or caused to be done by
the City, the owner of the property proposed to be assessed shall be provided
notice and opportunity for hearing before the City Council. The notice shall set
forth the amount proposed to be assessed, and include a statement of the time,
place, and date of hearing.
The court may order any one or more of the following:
1. Place a judgment against the person and/or property of defendant
for the costs of abatement.
2. Levy a civil penalty (fine) against the defendant of up to one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for the first offense and up to two hundred dollars
($200.00) for repeat offenses.
3. Order abatement of the violation in any manner.
4. Assess costs of abatement against the premises.
E. Emergency Abatement Procedure. If an Enforcement Officer determines
that a violation exists and constitutes an imminent, clear, and compelling danger
to health, safety or welfare of persons or property, the enforcement officer is
authorized to abate the violation or have it abated without prior notice and
opportunity for hearing. The costs of such action may be assess against the
premises. However, prior to such assessment, the City shall give a property
owner notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the City Council in
accordance with subsection D above.

reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely for the conduct of
their serious affairs, even if such evidence would be inadmissible in a
court of law. The Board's experience, technical competence, and
specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence.
The presiding officer of the Board shall conduct the hearing.
C. Decision of the Board. No hearing shall be valid unless a majority of the
Board is present, and no appeal shall be granted unless reached by a majority
of all members of the Board.

§402.3 Removal of Abandoned Motor Vehicles. The city police may remove and
impound any abandoned motor vehicle whether in operable or totally inoperable condition as defined by
Section 402.2A 1. Impoundment shall be in any city-owned garage or area, or in any privately-owned
public garage or area designated by the city council.
§402.4 Notice to Owner and Lienholders. The city police shall notify by certified
mail within three (3) days of having taken possession of the abandoned operable motor vehicle, the last
known registered owner of the motor vehicle and all lienholders of record, addressed to their last
known address of record that the abandoned motor vehicle has been taken into custody. Notice shall
be deemed given when mailed. Notice shall described the year, make, model and serial number of the
motor vehicle, set forth the location of the facility where it is being held, inform the owner of any
lienholders of their right to reclaim the motor vehicle within fourteen (14) days after the effective date of
the notice upon payment of all towing, preservation and storage charges resulting from placing the motor
vehicle in custody. The notice shall also state that the failure of the owner of lienholders to exercise their
right to reclaim the motor vehicle within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and
all lienholders of all right, title, claim and interest in the motor vehicle and that such failure to reclaim is
deemed consent to the sale of the motor vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the motor vehicle to a
demolisher. If the owner and lienholders do not exercise their right, they shall have no further right, title,
claim or interest in or to such motor vehicle, as provided by law.
A. If the identity of the last registered owner of an abandoned but operable vehicle cannot
be determined, or if the registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is
impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all
lienholders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in this city
shall be made by the city police and multiple listings may be included in said notice if
they are subject to the same time limits, and the same information as prescribed for
mailed notice shall be included.
B. The owner of any lienholder may, by written request deliver to the police chief prior to
the expiration of the fourteen (14) day reclaiming period, obtain an additional fourteen
(14) days within which the motor vehicle may be reclaimed.
§402.5 Impoundment Fees. The owner of lienholder shall pay three (3) dollars if
claimed within five (5) days of impounding, plus one dollar for each additional day within the reclaiming
period plus towing charges if stored by the city, or upon payment of the towing and storage fees, if
stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle shall be released. The amount of towing charges, and
the rate of storage charges by privately owned garages shall be established, by resolution of council,
before the provisions of this ordinance are carried out by the police.
§402.6 Auction of Operable Vehicles. If an abandoned motor vehicle which is
operable has not been reclaimed as provided by Section 402.4, the police chief shall make a
determination as to whether or not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways. If it is
3
to be sold for such use it shall first be inspected as required by law, have a valid certificate of inspection
affixed, and shall then be sold, and title given in accordance with law. Vehicles not sold for use upon
the highways shall be sold only in accordance with the restrictions in the state law. The purchaser shall
take title as provided for by law or if sold to a demolisher no further titling of the motor vehicle shall be
permitted. Proceeds from any sales shall apply to the cost of towing, preserving, storing and notification
required, in accordance with state law, and any balance shall be disposed of as required by law. Where
the sale of any vehicle fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs, the police chief shall apply for
reimbursement from the state as provided by law.

as defined in subsection A 1 of Section 402.2 of this ordinance or any such inoperable vehicle left on
private property shall be disposed of by the city police to a demolisher unless he deems it practicable to
sell it as provided in Section 402.6 of this ordinance. A sale to a demolisher shall not require the
notification procedures or public auction, but the police chief shall endeavor to obtain as much
compensation as possible to defray any costs to the city. A person, firm, corporation, or this city or
other unit of government upon whose property or in whose possession is found any abandoned motor
vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost or
destroyed, may, without notification procedures, dispose of such motor vehicle if it lacks an engine, or
two (2) or more wheels, or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable, to a
demolisher for junk without the title.
§402.8 Duties of Demolisher. Any demolisher whose purchases or otherwise
acquires an abandoned motor vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or otherwise demolish
such a motor vehicle. When a demolisher acquires a motor vehicle under Section 402.6 or 402.7 of
this ordinance, the demolisher shall apply to the city police for a certificate to demolish the vehicle. The
application shall include the name and address of the applicant, the year, make, model and serial number
of the motor vehicle. After the motor vehicle has been demolished, processed or changed so that it
physically is no longer a motor vehicle, the demolisher shall surrender the auction sales receipt or
certificate of authority to dispose of or demolish a motor vehicle to the state department of public safety
for cancellation.
§402.9 Junk Vehicles and Machinery a Nuisance. It is hereby declared that
storage within the corporate limits of a junk motor vehicle or junk machinery upon private property
owned or controlled by the owner of the vehicle or machinery, unless excepted by Section 402.13 of
this ordinance, constitutes a threat to the health and safety of the citizens and is a nuisance within the

stored upon private property within the corporate limits of this city in violation of Section 402.9, the
police chief shall within ten (10) days notify by certified mail the owner of said motor vehicle or other
property owner that:
A. The motor vehicle constitutes a nuisance under the provisions of this ordinance;
B. That the owner must remove or repair the motor vehicle or machinery in accordance
4
with the terms of Section 402.10 of this ordinance; and
C. That failure to remove or repair the motor vehicle or machinery will be sufficient cause
for its removal by the city at the owner's cost.
§402.11 Duty of Owner to Remove or Repair. The owner of a junk motor vehicle or
junk machinery (who is the owner or person in control of the property upon which it is stored) which
violates the provisions of Section 402.9 must within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from the
police chief remove the motor vehicle or machinery to an auto salvage yard or junk yard duly licensed
by this city, or to a lawful place of storage without the city limits, or repair the defects which cause such
motor vehicle or machinery to violate the provisions of this ordinance, including licensing if a motor
vehicle is not currently licensed.
§402.12 Abatement. If such owner of a junk motor vehicle or machinery shall fail to
remove or repair the motor vehicle in accordance with the terms of Section 402.10, the city police shall
abate such nuisance by causing the motor vehicle to be removed and impounded and sold or disposed
of as specified in Sections 402.5, 402.6 or 402.7 and the cost of abatement shall be charged to the
owner of the motor vehicle or other property owner.

vehicle or junk machinery stored within:

THEFT
§603.1 Theft. It is unlawful for any person to commit theft. A person commits
theft for purposes of this chapter when that person does any of the following and such theft does
not exceed $200.00 in value:
November 7, 2005 – Ordinance 2552
A. Takes possession or control of the property of another, or property in the possession
of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof.
B. Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property of another which
the person has in his or her possession or control, whether such possession or control
is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a manner which is inconsistent
with or a denial of the trust or of the owner's rights in such property, or conceals
found property, or appropriates such property to his or own use, when the owner of
such property is known to him or her. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal
property to return the property within seventy-two hours after a time specified in a
written agreement of lease or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation.
C. Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession, control, or
ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial use of property of another, by
deception. Where compensation for goods and services is ordinarily paid
immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering of such services, the
refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or offer to pay or without
having obtained from the owner or operator the right to pay subsequent to leaving the
premises gives rise to an inference that the goods or services were obtained by
deception.
D. Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to have been stolen, or
having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been stolen, unless the
person's purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or to deliver it to an
appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is found in possession of property
which has been stolen from two or more persons on separate occasions, or that the
person is a dealer or other person familiar with the value of such property and has
acquired it for a consideration which is far below its reasonable value, shall be
evidence from which the court or jury may infer that the person knew or believed
that the property has been stolen.
E. Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone else has a
security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party.
2
F. Makes, utters, draws, delivers, or gives any check, draft, or written order on any
bank, person or corporation, and obtains property or service in exchange therefor, if
the person knows that such check, draft or written order will not be paid when
presented.
Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because of insufficient
funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument the amount due
thereon within ten days of the maker's receipt of notice from the holder that payment
has been refused by the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such facts that the
maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation, notice of refusal
or payment shall be by certified mail, or by personal service in the manner prescribed
for serving original notices.
Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because the maker has
no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such fact that the maker
knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation.
G. Any act that is declared to be theft by any provision of the Code of Iowa, as
amended.
H. Obtains gas, electricity, or water from a public utility or obtains cable
television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection to the
supply or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting, removing or
tampering with the meter or service device so as to cause inaccurate
readings.
I. Knowingly and without authorization accesses or causes to be accessed a
computer, computer systems, or computer network, or any part thereof, for
the purpose of obtaining computer services, information or property or
knowingly and without authorization and with the intent to permanently
deprive the owner of possession, takes, transfers, conceals, or retains
possession of a computer, computer system, or computer network or any
computer software or computer program, or computer data contained in a
computer, computer system, or computer network.
J. Obtains the temporary use of video rental property with the intent to
deprive the owner of the use and possession of the video rental property
without the consent of the owner.
K. Lawfully obtains the temporary use of video rental property and fails to
return the video rental property by the agreed time with the intent to
deprive the owner of the use and permission of the video rental property
without the consent of the owner. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained herein, the aggregate value of the video rental property involved
shall be the original rental value of the video rental property.
3
Subsections H – K added; November 7, 2005 – Ordinance 2552
The value of property is its normal market or exchange value within the community at the
time that it is stolen. If money or property is stolen by a series of acts from the same person or
location, or from different persons by a series of acts which occur in approximately the same
location or time period so that the thefts are attributable to a single scheme, plan or conspiracy, such
acts may be considered a single theft and the value may be the total of all the property stolen.
§603.2 Penalty. Any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be
considered a simple misdemeanor as provided in Chapter 620 of this Code.
November 7, 2005 – Ordinance 2552
§603.3. Repealer. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the
provisions of this ordinance are hereby repealed.
§603.4. Severability Clause. If any section, provision or part of this ordinance
shall be adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the
ordinance as a whole or any section, provision, or part thereof not adjudged invalid or
unconstitutional.

RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENDERS
§604.1 Purpose. This article is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the
health and safety of children in Waukee from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend
in locations close to their residences. As recognized by the Eighth Circuit United States Court of
Appeals in its April 29, 2005 decision of Doe v. Miller, and as recognized by the Iowa Supreme
Court in State v. Seering, decided on July 29, 2005, the city finds and declares that sex offenders
are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are
much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for a new rape or sexual
assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and
temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protect children
where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state
law near schools and day care centers. The city finds and declares that in addition to schools and
daycare centers, children congregate or play at child-oriented facilities identified in section
604.3(1)

construction, operation, or maintenance of the Cable System there occurs a disturbance of any

reasonably comparable to the condition of the Public Way existing immediately prior to such
disturbance.
§701.23 Relocation for the Franchising Authority. Upon its receipt of
reasonable advance written notice, to be not less than ten (10) business days, the Grantee shall
protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the Public

§701.24 Relocation for a Third Party. The Grantee shall, on the request of
any Person holding a lawful permit issued by the Franchising Authority, protect, support, raise,
lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the Public Way as necessary any
property of the Grantee, provided: (A) the expense of such is paid by said Person benefiting

purposes of this subsection, “reasonable advance written notice” shall be no less than thirty (30)
business days in the event of a temporary relocation, and no less than one hundred twenty (120)

the Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work
shall be performed in substantial accordance with generally applicable federal, state, and local
regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
§701.27 Underground Construction. In those areas of the Service Area
where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing
telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise shall
construct, operate, and maintain its Cable System underground. Nothing contained in this
subsection shall require the Grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any
ground-mounted appurtenances.
§701.28 Access to Open Trenches. The Franchising Authority agrees to
include the Grantee in the platting process for any new subdivision. At a minimum, the
Franchising Authority agrees to require as a condition of issuing a permit for open trenching to
any utility or developer that (A) the utility or developer give the Grantee at least ten (10) days
advance written notice of the availability of the open trench, and (B) that the utility or developer
133858-1 5
provide the Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Grantee shall not be required to utilize any open trench.
§701.29 Required Extensions of the Cable System. Grantee agrees to
provide Cable Service to all residences in the Service Area subject to the density requirements
specified in this subsection. Whenever the Grantee receives a request for Cable Service from a
potential Subscriber in an unserved area contiguous to Grantee’s to existing distribution facilities
where there are at least 10 residences within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable
mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, it
shall extend its Cable System to such Subscribers at no cost to said Subscribers for the Cable
System extension, other than the published Standard/non-Standard Installation fees charged to
all Subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to extend the Cable System into any portion of the Service Area where another
operator is providing Cable Service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the
present Service Area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible
due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
§701.210 Subscriber Charges for Extensions of the Cable System. No
Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density
requirements of subsection 3.9 above, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the Cable
System to Subscriber(s) in that area if the Subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of
extending the Cable System. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to
the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual
number of residences per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or
distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service
hereunder shall bear the remaining cost to extend the Cable System on a pro rata basis. The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by
such potential Subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any
Standard/non-Standard Installation charges to extend the Cable System from the tap to the
residence.
§701.211 Cable Service to Public Buildings. The Grantee, upon request, shall
provide without charge, a Standard Installation and one outlet of Basic Cable to those
administrative buildings owned and occupied by the Franchising Authority, fire station(s), police
station(s), and K-12 public school(s) that are passed by its Cable System. The Cable Service
provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from
the Grantee. The Cable Service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such
outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The Franchising Authority shall take
reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the Grantee’s Cable System or any
loss or damage to Grantee’s Cable System. The Franchising Authority shall hold the Grantee
harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of Cable Service
required by this subsection. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such
buildings where a non-Standard Installation is required, unless the Franchising Authority or
133858-1 6
building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary Cable System
extension and/or non-Standard Installation. If additional outlets of Basic Cable are provided to
such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees
associated therewith.
§701.212 Emergency Use. If the Grantee provides an Emergency Alert System
(“EAS”)such EAS shall be operated in accordance with FCC regulations. The Franchising
Authority shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized Persons to operate the EAS
equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee’s Cable
System in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the
Cable System. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the Franchising Authority shall
hold the Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of use
of the EAS, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
§701.213 Reimbursement of Costs. If funds are available to any Person using
the Public Way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the Franchising
Authority shall reimburse the Grantee in the same manner in which other Persons affected by the
requirement are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the
Franchising Authority shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
§701.214 Public, Education and Government Access. Grantee shall provide
the Franchising Authority with one (1) Access channel on the Cable System designated for
Public, Education or Government access purposes. The Grantee shall make the Cable System
capable of originating programming from Waukee City Hall located at 230 Highway 6,
Waukee, IA 50263 no later than one hundred twenty days following the commencement of the
Agreement.
The access channel is made available to the Franchising Authority by the Grantee for the
purpose of cablecasting non-commercial programming by City residents, City administration
and educational institutions. The City agrees not to use the access channels to provide
commercial or revenue-generating services or services that may compete, directly or indirectly,
with services provided by the Company, provided, however, that the City may cablecast
acknowledgments of funding sources and the underwriting of programming costs.
The Grantee will provide the Franchising Authority with equipment selected by the Franchising
Authority from AVI Systems in the amount of $59,350.00 as necessary to originate cablecast
programming from the Waukee City Hall. The Franchising Authority shall retain ownership and
shall be responsible for maintenance of all equipment purchased by Grantee pursuant to this
section. The equipment purchase amount shall be considered a prepayment of franchise fees as
referenced in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. The Grantee shall collect and retain franchise fees
from Subscribers until the $59,350.00 payment has been recouped. The Grantee shall provide
the Franchising Authority with a statement of franchise fees collected to recoup the amount of
prepayment annually as required in Section 4.1(A). The Grantee shall pay all franchise fees to
133858-1 7
the Franchise Authority following reimbursement for the PEG access equipment for the
remaining term of the agreement.
§701.3 Regulation by the Franchising Authority
§701.31 Franchise Fee.
A. The Grantee shall pay to the Franchising Authority a franchise
fee of five percent (5%) of annual Gross Revenues (as defined in subsection 1.1 of this
Franchise). In accordance with the Cable Act, the twelve (12) month period applicable under
the Franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year. The franchise
fee payment shall be due annually and payable within 90 days after the close of the preceding
calendar year. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a
representative of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
B. Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation
for recovery by the Franchising Authority of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three
(3) years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the Franchising Authority.
§701.32 Rates and Charges. The Franchising Authority may regulate rates for
the provision of Basic Cable and equipment as expressly permitted by federal or state law.
§701.33 Renewal of Franchise.
A. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree that any
proceedings undertaken by the Franchising Authority that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s
Franchise shall be governed by and comply with the renewal provisions of federal law.
B. In addition to the procedures set forth in the Cable Act, the
Franchising Authority agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity
of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the
Grantee under the then current Franchise term. The Franchising Authority further agrees that
such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee has adequate
time to submit a proposal pursuant to the Cable Act and complete renewal of the Franchise
prior to expiration of its term.
C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
subsection 4.3, the Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that at any time during the term
of the then current Franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to
comment in accordance with the provisions of federal law the Franchising Authority and the
Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then
current Franchise and the Franchising Authority may grant a renewal thereof.
133858-1 8
D. The Grantee and the Franchising Authority consider the terms
set forth in this subsection 4.3 to be consistent with the express renewal provisions of the Cable
Act.
§701.34 Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of the Grantee’s
Franchise is denied or the Franchise is lawfully terminated, and the Franchising Authority either
lawfully acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of
ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the
price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act.
The Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a final determination
of a lawful revocation of the Franchise, the Grantee shall be given at least twelve (12) months to
effectuate a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee
shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise during this
period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee
or assignee of its Cable System which is reasonably acceptable to the Franchising Authority, the
Grantee and the Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have
pursuant to federal or state law. It is further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of
the Cable System during the twelve (12) month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor
an extinguishment of, any rights of either the Franchising Authority or the Grantee.
§701.35 Transfer of Franchise. The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the
Franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without prior
written notice to the Franchising Authority. No such notice shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or
interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or Cable System in order to secure indebtedness.
133858-1 9
§701.4 Books and Records. The Grantee agrees that the Franchising
Authority, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Grantee and no more than once annually
may review such of its books and records at the Grantee’s business office, during normal
business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance
with the terms of this Franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the subsection of the
Franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and
records for easy access by the Franchising Authority. Alternatively, if the books and records
are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option,
choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the Franchising Authority’s representative to view
the books and records at the appropriate location. The Grantee shall not be required to
maintain any books and records for Franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to
disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor
disclose books and records of any affiliate which is not providing Cable Service in the Service
Area. The Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as
confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a
need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required
to provide Subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
§701.5 Insurance and Indemnification.

effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the Franchise, Commercial General
Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage. The Franchising Authority shall be designated as an additional insured. Such
insurance shall be noncancellable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the
Franchising Authority. Upon written request, the Grantee shall provide a Certificate of
Insurance showing evidence of the coverage required by this subsection.
§701.52 Indemnification. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless, and defend the Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and
against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or
bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the Grantee’s construction,
operation, or maintenance of its Cable System in the Service Area provided that the Franchising

of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.

notice described in subsection 7.1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection 7.2, or in
the event that the alleged default is not remedied within thirty (30) days or the date projected
pursuant to 7.2(C) above, if it intends to continue its investigation into the default, then the
Franchising Authority shall schedule a public hearing. The Franchising Authority shall provide
the Grantee at least ten (10) days prior written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time,
place and purpose of such hearing, and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.
§701.64 Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event
the Franchising Authority, after the hearing set forth in subsection 7.3, determines that the
Grantee is in default of any provision of the Franchise, the Franchising Authority may:

Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The notice shall set forth the exact
nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to

Authority has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee, it may then seek
termination of the Franchise at a public hearing. The Franchising Authority shall cause to be
served upon the Grantee, at least thirty (30) days prior to such public hearing, a written notice
specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the Franchise.
133858-1 11
At the designated hearing, Grantee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full
participation, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant
evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the officials,
agents, employees or consultants of the Franchising Authority, to compel the testimony of other
persons as permitted by law, and to question witnesses. A complete verbatim record and

Franchise shall be revoked. If the Franchising Authority determines that the Franchise shall be
revoked, the Franchising Authority shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in writing.
The Grantee may appeal such determination of the Franchising Authority to an appropriate
court which shall have the power to review the decision of the Franchising Authority de novo.
Grantee shall be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be
taken within sixty (60) days of Grantee’s receipt of the determination of the Franchising
Authority.
The Franchising Authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it
deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority’s rights under the Franchise in lieu of
revocation of the Franchise.
§701.66 Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in

control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or
monitor their utility poles to which the Grantee’s Cable System is attached, as well as
unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.
Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Franchising Authority’s intention
to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the Franchise for violations
of the Franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal
negative impact on the Subscribers within the Service Area, or where strict performance would
result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be
derived by the Franchising Authority and/or Subscribers.

however, the City may reevaluate the franchise ordinance every five years, commencing with the
10th year, by providing MidAmerican Energy Company written notice at least 120 prior to 10, 15,
and 20th anniversaries of the ordinance. If such a request to re-evaluate or amend the ordinance is
made by the City and the parties are unable to agree to amend the ordinance within 90 days or by a
mutually agreed upon date, then the City may elect to terminate or continue this franchise upon the
expiration of the re-evaluation period. If the City does not seek such re-evaluation by means of a
written notice to the MidAmerican Energy at least 120 days prior to the expiration of year 10, 15, or
20th anniversaries, as provided herein, this franchise will continue without change.
703.02. The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and

which may constitute a trade secret or which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure
by state or federal law. The City shall provide the Company written notice of a request to release
3
information to allow the Company to determine if the information sought is confidential. The
Company shall respond to the City within 10 business days of receiving the City’s written notice
request. If requested by the Company, the City shall not release any such data except by court
order, provided, however, the City reserves the right to disagree with the Company
determination that the information is confidential, in which case the Company shall be given
notice in order that the Company may seek injunctive relief. In the event the City agrees the
information is confidential, or that a court determination is required to determine if the
information is confidential, the City shall defend or bring any necessary court actions, provided,
however, that in the event the City refuses to release records, or the City itself brings an action to
determine if records are confidential, the City may tender the defense or prosecution of such
legal actions to the Company and the Company shall accept such tender.

regulate and control its local affairs, and all ordinances and regulations of the city shall be
enforceable against the Company.
703.11. The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to any person or
property, caused or occasioned in whole or in part, by the Company’s negligence in construction,

distribution of electric energy to customers within the corporate limits of the city (excluding,
however, the sale of electric energy to the city), or assessed or charged in any other manner the City
deems appropriate and is consistent with applicable laws as may be changed from time to time, as
determined by resolution upon a majority vote of the Waukee City Council at a duly scheduled City
Council meeting after fourteen (14) days advance public notice. The City shall give the Company 90

shall make modifications required to accommodate the City equipment. In the event that a clearance,
guying, grounding or other system design or construction problem is identified by the Company, or
the Iowa Utilities Board or its inspectors, and said problem is a result of City facilities, the City shall

discretion of the Company, it is determined that said attachments may create a hazardous situation or
wind or other conditions may place undue stress on specific Company facilities, the City shall not be
authorized to attach to those facilities. If attachments are in place, upon notification by the Company

facilities with no liability to City for the loss of system integrity.

purpose of providing electric utilities to the extent necessary to serve a public use and in a
reasonable relationship to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public interest upon
approval of the City Council. The Company must establish the necessity for each taking of private
property, and when so established, the City Council may approve the condemnation of the private
property by resolution. Any such exercise of the eminent domain powers shall be conducted in
accordance with the Waukee Municipal Code and Iowa Law. In the exercise of eminent domain
powers pursuant to this provision, the Company shall be responsible for any amounts awarded. In
the event the City incurs expenses related to the Company’s exercise of the eminent domain power
granted in this ordinance, in addition to the normal costs of internal processing of its request to
receive and its exercise of eminent domain powers, the Company will reimburse the City for its
reasonable extra expenses.

comply with federal state and local laws and ordinances and applicable design standards. The

company which may result in the cutting of any pavement unless the method is first approved in
writing by the City Engineer. Plans submitted upon and after the effective date of this franchise
shall identify Company Facilities proposed to be located in the right of way and those that would be
located on property owned in fee by the Company or on private easements.
In the event of an emergency situation, the Company is authorized to proceed with

successors and assigns; provided that any assignment by the Company or successor to the company,
shall be subject to the approval of the City Council by resolution, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The City shall have 60 days from the effective date of the assignment, or designation of
successor in interest, to adopt the resolution. If the City fails to adopt a resolution affirming or
rejecting the assignment during the 60 day period the assignment or successor in interest shall be
