      (3)   (FES) Job categories.



         (a)   The job categories established by the FES job
classification system are as follows:



COMOT   Clerical, Office Machine Operators, Technician



LTC      Labor, Trades, and Crafts



PAT      Professional, Administrative, Technological



EXE      Executive



C-POLE   Civilian-Protection Occupations and Law Enforcement



         (b)   A job in one category cannot be compared to jobs
in another category. For example, COMOT jobs cannot be compared to PAT
jobs.  The Factor Evaluation System (FES) only compares a position to jobs
within the same job category.



         (c)   All positions within a job category are classified
by assigning numbers (points) to the job description. These points are called
“factor evaluation points” and were assigned by a factor team of
personnel specialists using factor guide charts in arriving at the total
factor evaluation points. These factor points were compared to salaries and
wages to determine pay classifications grades among classified positions in
each job category.



      (4)   Position descriptions. The basis of the city job
classification system is the job description. It is a written statement for
each job and contains the following information:



   Title of Position



   Department in which the position exists



   Job Category (COMOT, LTC, PAT, EXE, C-POLE)



   Date written documents a record of the job and job description



   Date revised documents a record of changes in job



   FLSA status documents exempt/non-exempt status for overtime



   Status documents full or part-time status of job



   Statement of duties includes specifying key dimensions of the job



   Job posting are used for recruitment and hiring purposes



      (5)   Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The salary and hourly
pay rates for all classified jobs are established pursuant to the provisions
of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The city has established
timekeeping and payroll policies and procedures to comply with applicable
provisions of the FLSA. A listing of all classified positions and their
status under the FLSA is on file in the Personnel Department.



      (6)   Job review requests. Job review requests need to be
submitted for reclassification of a position, and for new positions.



         (a)   When a position becomes vacant. The department
head shall review the job description for significant changes before either
hiring a new person, or, alternatively, eliminating the position.



            1.   If the department head believes changes in
the job description may warrant reclassification of a position, the
department files a re- classification request while the position is vacant.



            2.   The department head must notify the Personnel
Director of his/her intent to eliminate a position.



         (b)   Departments submitting requests for
reclassification of a position and new positions, application of pay policies
shall provide all necessary information on forms provided for this purpose.



         (c)   New position requests are subject to available
funding and approval by the City Council.



         (d)   New position requests should follow a long-range
organizational plan, and not be submitted piecemeal.



         (e)   Departments submitting requests for
reclassification of a position and new positions are to be submitted on
completed forms including supporting documentation for consideration of the
position.



         (f)   An authorized new position, classification, and
salary shall be included in office/department annual budget.



      (7)   Job reclassification/reorganization review procedures.



         (a)   A job reclassification occurs when the job duties
and responsibilities are modified to the extent that additional skills and
knowledge are required to perform the duties, warranting an upgrade to a
higher factor evaluation level; or when duties and responsibilities are
modified, lessening skills and knowledge required to perform the duties,
warranting a downgrade to a lower factor evaluation level. Cases involving a
job reclassification normally involve a departmental reorganization where job
functions are impacted by the elimination or reassignment of duties; or when
new functions and responsibilities are assigned to an existing position. A
job reclassification may or may not modify the salary assigned to the job.



         (b)   The following reclassification/ reorganization
review procedures are established to provide a systematic method to process
such requests. Departments submitting a request shall use the following steps
to make reclassification/office reorganization requests:



            1.   Step 1: Secure “Job Classification Review
Form” and a copy of the official job description adopted by the city for
the position(s) being reviewed from the Personnel Director.



            2.   Step 2: Complete and return “review
form,” including supportive documentation to the Personnel Director.
Proposed revisions to the job description should be indicated on the
description and be included as part of supportive documentation.



         3.   Step 3: The "review form" and supportive
documentation will be submitted for presentation before the Mayor and City
Council Salary Committee.



            4.   Step 4: The Mayor and Salary Committee will
review and evaluate the requests. If approved, the "review form" and
supportive documentation will be submitted to the City Attorney for review.
Depending on the complexity of the job reclassification/reorganization, the
City Attorney may retain an employment professional to review such
modifications and prepare a report.



            5.   Step 5: The City Council shall review all
pertinent information and make final determination for approval/disapproval
of all classifications.



      (8)   New position requests.



         (a)   A new position involves the preparation and
classification of a new job description and determination of current staffing
levels and workload to support the need for the position.



         (b)   The following new position review procedures are
established to provide a systematic method to process such requests for new
positions, additional employees in an already existing position, or the
convert a part-time positions to full-time. Departments submitting a request
shall use the following stops to make new positions/new employee requests:



            1.   Step 1: Secure “Job Classification Review
Form” from the Personnel Director.



            2.   Step 2: Complete and return questionnaire
including supporting documentation (new job description, if required).



            3.   Step 3: If a new position description and
classification are needed, the established job classification review
procedures are to be followed. Complete a job questionnaire for either the
COMOT, PAT, EXE, LTC, C-POLE job categories, and submit to the Personnel
Director. A “draft” job description will be prepared by the professional
assigned the responsibility for preparation of job descriptions.



            4.   Step 4: New position/ employee questionnaire
and related information will be submitted with presentation before the
Personnel Director, Mayor, and Salary Committee.



            5.   Step 5: The Mayor and Salary Committee will
review and evaluate the new position/new employee request and submit
recommendations for approval/disapproval to the City Council.



            6.   Step 6: The City Council shall review all
pertinent information and make final determination for approval/disapproval.



      (9)   Compensation policies.



         (a)   Pay schedules. Factor Evaluation System (FES) job
category pay schedules are adopted as part of the annual Salary Ordinance and
shall be maintained in the Personnel Office.



         (b)   New hires. New hires in the COMOT, PAT, C-POLE,
LTC positions are to be compensated at the job classification
“Initiation” pay rate. In the event that an applicant possess exceptional
skill and knowledge attained in previous employment, a department head may
request “Step 2 Placement” on the pay schedule. Such requests must
document equivalent training and experience and be submitted to the Mayor for
approval prior to making an offer of employment to such applicants. In the
event that “Step 2 Placement” is approved, the new hire will not awarded
time in service with the city; future step pay increases will be determined
by performance and years of service.



         (c)   Step pay increases. Step pay increases shall be
linked to eligible years of service and satisfactory performance evaluations
conducted prior to payment of any step pay increases.



      (10)   The Position Classification Schedule, as amended, is
hereby adopted by reference and incorporated herein as fully as if set out at
length in this code of ordinances.

manner provided for in this division (A).



      (2)   Application.



         (a)   All persons seeking employment with the city shall

§ 35.014  OVERTIME AND CALL BACK PAY.



   (A)   Policy.  All employees of the city may be requested to work
overtime for reasonable periods.



   (B)   Determination of overtime.  All work beyond 40 hours in any

Recreation Director, Wastewater Treatment Superintendent, Public Utility
Office Manager, Airport Manager, City Attorney, Redevelopment Director, MS4
Director, City Engineer.  Department heads will not be allowed to accumulate
over 240 hours of comp time.  Department heads will provide the Mayor with a
monthly time sheet showing accumulated comp hours to ensure that maximum comp
hours earned are below 240 hours.  At the time of termination of employment,
department heads will not be paid for any time over 240 comp hours.



   (D)   Department heads.  Department heads are expected to work
overtime as reasonably needed without monetary compensation.  Department

requests of all employees consistent with those needs.



      (2)   Non-probationary employees (employees who have completed
at least one year of service) who have resigned with proper notification,
shall be paid in full for their accumulated vacation days up to a total of 45
days.



   (B)   Scheduling.  The employee shall notify his or her department
head at least two weeks in advance of the date he/she would like to take the
vacation leave.  If on the same day, multiple requests within a department
are made for the same vacation period, preference will be given according to
seniority in determining which employee’s request is approved for that
particular time.



   (C)   Annual allowance.  Full-time city employees shall accrue one
vacation day for each month of completed service.  Probationary employees
shall not be allowed to accrue vacation time until they have completed six
months of service, at which time they will begin earning one vacation day per
each month of completed service.  Employees will then begin accruing bonus
vacation days, on their anniversary date, after six years of completed
service.  The totals per year are as follows:

benefits by completing a short term disability leave of absence request
form.  This form must be completed and returned to the personnel department
within eight days of the injury or illness. Failure to submit the STD form
could result in denial of benefits.  Upon approval of such benefits, there
will be a one-week waiting period prior to any benefits taking effect. 
During this time, an employee must use five of their accrued sick, vacation
and/or personal days.  If the employee does not have five accrued days then

light duty then medical doctor must submit a written list of restrictions.

the bi-weekly base pay. Employees will have the option after 90 days to use
banked times on a calendar day basis until all time is exhausted before
moving to reduce pay percentage.



      (3)   Employees who are off work over 180 calendar days will
be covered by the city’s long term disability plan, at which time their
employment will be terminated.  However, should the employee be released to
work again, the city shall make an effort for re-hire.

   (A)   The City Council is hereby authorized to budget and
appropriate funds from the general fund or from other funds to provide
membership for the city and the elected and appointed officials and members
of the municipality’s boards, council, departments, or agencies in local,

   The city hereby establishes the following policies covering travel
reimbursement and the promotion of city business as recommended by the State
Board of Accounts.



   (A)   Lodging costs vary from city to city and state to state, so
officials should use common discretion on room costs.



   (B)   Most conferences offer a flat rate in lodging no matter if one
or two are in a room.  If there is an additional charge for an additional
person other than a city employee, officials must pay the additional expense.



   (C)   The cost of meals and beverages can vary due to the nature of
events.  City officials should use common discretion on costs of meals and
types of beverages.



   (D)   Parking costs and tolls when officials are on city business
will be paid by the city.



   (E)   Because city officials are involved in economic and industrial
development and travel can be necessary on short notice, prior approval of
travel and promotion of city business is not necessary as long as the funds
are appropriated in those accounts.



   (F)   When claims are submitted to the Board of Public Works and
Safety, they should be adequately itemized to show the nature of the
expenditure.



   (G)   The City Council has for years funded a travel and promotion
of city business account for the Board of Works on an annual basis.  These
funds are very important for not only the future of the city but for
continuance of city business.

is necessary, the employee must notify the Personnel Director within three
business days. The Personnel Director must determine whether the course(s)
would be beneficial to that department or to the general operations of the
city, and whether the employee has been diligent in applying for other

recommendation to the panel as to whether the application should be approved
or denied, and will deliver the application to the Panel.



      (3)   A panel consisting of the Mayor, the department head and
the Personnel Director will review the application and determine whether the
course(s) would be beneficial to the general operations of the city and

assistance funds. The panel must determine whether to approve or deny the
application and must make a written finding supporting the approval or
denial. The Personnel Director must notify the employee of the decision
approving or denying the application prior to the scheduled start date for
the course(s).



   (C)   The amount of reimbursement paid by the city to an approved
employee will be  based on the final grade that the employee receives for
the course(s), as follows:



      (1)   A final grade of “A-” or above will result in 100%
reimbursement.



      (2)   A final grade of “B-” to “B+” will result in 80%
reimbursement.



      (3)   A final grade of “C-” to “C+” will result in 60%
reimbursement.



      (4)   A final grade of “D+” or lower will result in no
reimbursement.



   (D)   Upon completion of the course(s) and upon receipt of the final
grade(s), an approved employee may prepare a claim to the city for
reimbursement.  The claim must include the following information:



      (1)   The name of the employee;



      (2)   The final grade;



      (3)   The amount sought, including an accounting showing the
cost of the course(s), less all grants or educational assistance that the
employee received from other sources, and less the percentage reimbursement
for final grade(s) as indicated in division (C) above;



      (4)   An attached copy of the approved application for
employee education assistance; and



      (5)   An attached copy of the receipt from the institution
confirming payment for the course(s).



   (E)   The employee must deliver the claim for reimbursement to his
or her department head for review.  If the department head finds the claim
to be in correct form, the department head will turn the claim in for payment.



   (F)   If an approved employee leaves employment with the city for
any reason within two years of receiving educational reimbursement, the
employee must repay the city the full amount of the reimbursement received
during that two-year period. This repayment must be paid in full within one
year of the date the employee leaves employment with the city.

§ 50.008  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS REQUIRED TO PERMANENTLY MARK SEWER
LATERAL LOCATIONS.



   (A)   The construction contractor shall furnish a record in approved
usable form, showing the location of each sanitary sewer house connection at
the property line or at the utility easement line, located at a right angle
to a point in and along the center line of the main sewer, the latter point
being carefully measured from the nearest downstream manhole.  Such careful
measurements and determinations shall be continuously made by the contractor,
simultaneously with the construction and the record therefore, in required
form, shall be promptly completed and submitted to the Engineer and
Superintendent before the final acceptance of the sewer construction.



   (B)   In addition to division (A), the construction contractor
shall, when sidewalks are available opposite the sewer being constructed,
mark the street side of the walk directly opposite the sewer connection with
an “S” or a metal pin.  This may also be done on the curb.



   (C)   If there are no sidewalks or curbs in the construction, then
the locater should be a metal pin incased in the concrete locating the
lateral.



   (D)   The water service lines should be permanently marked in the
same manner.



   (E)   Within 60 days from the last date of construction, the “as
built” of the sewer lines with the distance of laterals from the manholes
are required to be sent to the Superintendent of the wastewater treatment
plant.

§ 50.009  CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION INSPECTION OF SANITARY SEWERS REQUIRED.



   The construction contractor shall be required to perform a closed
circuit television inspection of the sanitary sewer between manholes as
follows:



   (A)   A camera equipped with remote control devices to adjust the
light intensity and 1,000 linear feet of sewer cable shall be provided.



      (1)   The camera should be able to transmit a continuous image
to the  television monitor as it is being pulled through the pipe.  The
image shall be clear enough to enable the engineer and others viewing the
monitor to easily evaluate the interior condition of the pipe.



      (2)   The camera should have a digital display for linear
footage and project number and an audio voice-over shall be made during the
inspection identifying problems.



   (B)   The pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned before the camera is
installed and television is commenced.



   (C)   (1)   The VHS tape of the entire sewer line and
reproduction map indicating the pipe segment numbers of all the pipe that has
been televised shall be submitted to the owner, and/or the city for their
records.



      (2)   If any pipe and/or joint is found to be leaking, the
contractor shall be required to repair that portion of the pipe to the
satisfaction and approval of the engineer and Superintendent.



   (D)   (1)   The televised inspection should take place after the
back-filling has been in place for 30 days.  This test can be done at the
same time of the deflection test. 



      (2)   The contractor will bear all costs for tests and testing
equipment.

INSTALLATION OF SEWERS



§ 50.010  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   It is the policy of the city that all sewers shall be
installed in a good workmanlike manner so that the sewer system of the city
will require a minimum of maintenance.



   (B)   The bottom quadrant of all sewer pipes constructed shall be
fully and uniformly supported.  Where the floor of the trench is not
sufficiently stable or firm to prevent vertical or lateral movement of the
pipe after installation, a supplementary foundation shall be provided.



      (1)   Proper support around the pipe bells is particularly
important and excavation of the bells should be as small as possible.



      (2)   Pipe trenches should be of a minimum width, as the
distance between the pipe wall and trench wall increases, the load on the
pipe increases.



      (3)   Thorough tamping of the backfill is important, for it
prevents lateral displacement of the pipe and assures uniform load
distribution.

unit, or business unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water,
or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly
or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the
city, and in addition uses water from another source which is not measured by
a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the city,
then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by
the city in order to ascertain the rate or charge provided by §§ 50.022 and
50.023.



   (B)   However, the owner or other interested party, at his expense,

unit, or business unit discharging sanitary sewage industrial wastes, water,
or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly
or indirectly, uses water in excess of the quantity allowed for the
applicable minimum charge per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction
of the city that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does
not and cannot enter the sanitary sewerage system, then the city may
determine in the manner and by the method deemed practicable the percentage
of metered water entering the sanitary sewerage system.  This percentage,
when determined, shall then constitute the basis of sewage service charges.



   (B)   However, the city in its discretion may require or permit the
installation of additional meters at the expense of the owner or other
interested party in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water
actually entering the sewerage system, in which case the quantity of water
used to determine the sewage service charge shall be the quantity of water
actually entering the sanitary sewerage system as so determined.

have the right to base its charges not only on volume, but also on the
strength and character of the sewage and wastes which it is required to treat
and dispose of.



   (B)   The city shall have the right to measure and determine the
strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or
indirectly, into the city’s sanitary sewerage system, in the manner and by
the method it deems practicable in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge.



   (C)   Extra charges based on strength of the sewage and liquid
wastes shall be made on the following basis.

§ 50.030  RATE ADJUSTMENT.



   To determine the strength of any sewage and wastes, samplings and
analysis may be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the
city.  After charges have been established based upon the strength of sewage
and wastes, the owner may request reconsideration of these charges by the
city by submitting, if requested, an analysis of composite samples of the
sewage and wastes certified by a registered engineer or a graduate chemist
subject to the charges.  The city may then adjust the charges to the rates
required by the analysis or may recheck the findings by additional sampling
and analysis. Requests for rate adjustment may be submitted no more than once
every 12 months.

CONNECTION AND USE



§ 50.045  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   (A)   This subchapter sets forth uniform requirements for
dischargers into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) authority
wastewater collection and treatment systems, and enables the "Authority" to
protect public health in conformity with all applicable local, state and
Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the
General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403) relating thereto. The
objectives of this subchapter are:



      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
authority wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of
the system or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;



      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
authority wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the
POTW, and which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the
atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;



      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewater and sludge from the system;



      (4)   To regulate the use of public and private sewers and the
installation and connection of building sewers;



      (5)   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by
wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general
public;



      (6)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater
and sludge from the POTW; and



      (7)   To enable the City of Shelbyville to comply with its
national pollutant discharge elimination system permit conditions, sludge use
and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or state laws to which the
publicly owned treatment works is subject.



   (B)   This subchapter provides for the regulation of discharges into
the authority wastewater system through the enforcement of administrative
regulations.  This subchapter does not provide for the recovery of
operations, maintenance or replacement costs of the POTW or the costs
associated with the construction of collection and treatment systems used by
industrial dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which are the
subject of separate enactments.



   (C)   This subchapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned
treatment works. The subchapter authorizes the issuance of individual
wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures;
requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.049  LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.



   (A)   Industrial users shall be required to meet the applicable
pretreatment standard as defined in applicable pretreatment standard in §
50.046.



   (B)   National categorical pretreatment standards. The national
categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405 through 471, are hereby incorporated into this subchapter and
shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated categories, if more
stringent than state or local limits.



      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed
only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits
in accordance with divisions (B)(5) and (6).



      (2)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard
are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either
as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.



      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).



      (4)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
pretreatment standard in accordance with the following divisions of this
section.



         (a)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted
to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water
in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit
for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the
industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis
(i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of division (4)(b) of this section are met.



         (b)   Criteria.



            1.   Either:



               a.   The applicable categorical pretreatment
standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they
shall be applied on a net basis; or



               b.   The industrial user demonstrates that
the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical
pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the
standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.



            2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and
grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the
constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially
similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or
unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants
either at the outfall or elsewhere.



            3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent
necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to
a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be
necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with
standard(s) adjusted under this section.



            4.   Credit shall be granted only if the user
demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as
that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if
it finds that no environmental degradation will result.



      (5)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed
only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request
that the City of Shelbyville convert the limits to equivalent mass limits.
The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within
the discretion of the authority. The city may establish equivalent mass
limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in
divisions (B)(5)(a)1. through (B)(5)(a)5. below.



         (a)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the
industrial user must:



            1.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ,
water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water
use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;



            2.   Currently use control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for
treatment;



            3.   Provide sufficient information to establish
the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on
data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the
facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily
flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of
current operating conditions;



            4.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels,
or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits
are not appropriate to control the discharge; and



            5.   Have consistently complied with all
applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.



         (b)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass
limits must:



            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and
treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent
mass limits;



            2.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates
through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;



            3.   Continue to record the facility's production
rates and notify the authority whenever production rates are expected to vary
by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division
(B)(5)(a)3.. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the authority
will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and



            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable
water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
division (B)(4)(a)1. of this section so long as it discharges under an
equivalent mass limit.



         (c)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the
authority:



            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by
multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es)
of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly
average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the
appropriate unit conversion factor;



            2.   Upon notification of a revised production
rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and



            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in
subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial
user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the
implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual
average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent
mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for
treatment pursuant to division (E).  The industrial user must also be in
compliance with § 50.0642(C) regarding the prohibition of bypass.



      (6)   The authority may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users.  The conversion is at the discretion of the
authority.



      (7)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must
comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of
the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations
were derived.



      (8)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one
limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit
for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations.
Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitation.



      (9)   Any industrial user operating under a permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production-based standard shall notify the authority within two business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying
the authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate
of the long term average production rate.



   (C)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to
such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than Federal
requirements and limitations or those in this or any other applicable
ordinance.



   (D)   Right of revision. The authority reserves the right to amend
this subchapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives
set forth in § 50.045.



   (E)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or
process water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of
diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with standards set forth in this
subchapter.  The authority may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or
in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.



   (F)   Municipal supplemental limitations.



      (1)   The authority is authorized to establish local limits
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).



      (2)   The following pollutant limits are established to

§ 50.050  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by
this subchapter.  Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
discharger's cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
authority for review, and shall be approved by the authority before
construction of the facility.  Each existing discharger shall complete its
plan and submit same to the authority within 180 days of adoption of this
subchapter.  No discharger who discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid
date shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the
authority.



   (B)   (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not
limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic
nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that
might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the authority of the incident.



      (2)   Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures by the authority shall not relieve the discharger from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements
of this subchapter.



   (C)   Dischargers shall notify the authority immediately upon the
occurrence of a slugload, or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by
this subchapter.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the
authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a slug discharge. The notification shall include location of discharge,
date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions.  Any discharger who discharges a slugload of prohibited
materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in
addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the authority on account
thereof under state or Federal law.



   (D)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the authority, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred
as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
subchapter.



   (E)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of
a discharge described in division (A), above.  Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.



   (F)   Dischargers must notify the authority immediately of any
changes at the facility affecting the potential of a slug discharge. The
authority will reevaluate the current slug control plan and determine if a
new plan is necessary.



   (G)   The authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The authority may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the authority may
develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:



      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine
batch discharges;



      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;



      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the authority of
any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 50.063(C) of this
chapter; and



      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and

temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;



         (d)   Information indicating that the permitted
discharge poses a threat to the City of Shelbyville's POTW, City of
Shelbyville personnel, or the receiving waters;



         (e)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the
individual wastewater discharge permit;



         (f)   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose
all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any
required reporting;



         (g)   Revision of or a grant of variance from
categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;



         (h)   To correct typographical or other errors in the
individual wastewater discharge permit; or



         (i)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or
operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with §
50.057(F).



      (2)   The authority may modify a general permit for good
cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:



         (a)   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, state,
or local pretreatment standards or requirements;



         (b)   A change in the POTW that requires either a
temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;



         (c)   To correct typographical or other errors in the
individual wastewater discharge permit; or



         (d)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or
operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with §
50.057(F).



   (F)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit
transfer. Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage under general
permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee
gives at least 30 days advance notice to the authority and the authority
approves the individual wastewater discharge permit or the general permit
coverage transfer.  The notice to the authority must include a written
certification by the new owner or operator which:



      (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator has no
immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes;



      (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to
occur; and



      (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the
existing individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.



      (4)   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders
the individual wastewater discharge permit or coverage under the general
permit void as of the date of facility transfer.



   (G)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit
revocation.



      (1)   The authority may revoke an individual wastewater
discharge permit or coverage under a general permit for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following reasons:



         (a)   Failure to notify the authority of significant
changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;



         (b)   Failure to provide prior notification to the
authority of changed conditions pursuant to § 50.057(E);



         (c)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all
relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;



         (d)   Falsifying self monitoring reports and
certification statements;



         (e)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;



         (f)   Refusing to allow the authority timely access to

of business ownership of a permitted facility; or



         (m)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or
requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or the general
permit or this subchapter.



      (2)   Individual wastewater discharge permits or coverage
under general permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or
transfer of business ownership. All individual wastewater discharge permits
or general permits issued to a user are void upon the issuance of a new
individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to that user.



   (H)   Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit
reissuance. A user with an expiring individual wastewater discharge permit or
general permit shall apply for individual wastewater discharge permit or
general permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in
accordance with § 50.054(E) of this chapter, a minimum of 60 days prior to
the expiration of the user's existing individual  wastewater discharge
permit or general permit.



   (I)   Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
Wastewater from another municipality or user located within another
municipality shall not be discharged into the wastewater disposal system or
otherwise to the facilities of the authority. 



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.057  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCHARGER.



   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports.



      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW shall submit to the authority a report which contains
the information listed in division (2), below.  At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the authority a report which contains
the information listed in division (2), below.  A new source shall report
the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards.  A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.



      (2)   Users described above shall submit the information set
forth below.



         (a)   All information required in § 50.054(E)(1)(a),
(c), and (f).



         (b)   Measurement of pollutants.



            1.   The user shall provide the information
required in § 50.054(E)(1)(g)1. through 4.



            2.   The user shall take a minimum of one
representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this section.



            3.   Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other
wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the
user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of
the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance
with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass
limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted
limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority;



            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with divisions (J) and (K) of this section;



            5.   The authority may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures;



            6.   The baseline report shall indicate the time,
date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and
expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.



         (c)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by
the user's authorized representative as defined in § 50.046 and certified by
a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.



         (d)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment
and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
O&M must be provided.  The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in division (B) of this section.



         (e)   Signature and report certification. All baseline
monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with division (N)(1) of
this section and signed by an authorized representative as defined in §
50.046.



   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(2)(d) of this
section:



      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but
are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);



      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;



      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the authority
no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the
steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and



      (4)   In no event shall more than nine  months elapse between
such progress reports to the authority.



   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the authority a report containing the information described in §
50.054(E)(1)(f) and (g), and division (A)(2)(b) of this section.  For users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance
with the procedures in § 50.049(B). This report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long term production rate.  For all other users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period.  All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with division (N)(1) of this section. All sampling will be done in
conformance with division (K).



   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.



      (1)   Except as specified in division (D)(3) below, all
significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the authority
submit no less than twice per year (June and December or on dates specified)
reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.  Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement provided, however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.  In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the authority or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. The authority, for
good cause shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize the
submission of the reports on months other than those specified above.



      (2)   The City of Shelbyville may authorize an industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial
user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or
is present only at background levels from intake water and without any
increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:



         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from
the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater;



         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the
duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge
permit, but in no case longer than five years.  The user must submit a new
request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit (See § 50.054(E)(1)(h));



         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of
the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes;



         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed
in accordance with the definition of authorized representative of industrial
user in § 50.046, and include the certification statement in § 50.057(N)(1)
(40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii));



         (e)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as
a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method
from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that
pollutant was used in the analysis;



         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the
authority must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its
request for the waiver must be maintained by the authority for three years
after expiration of the waiver;



         (g)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and
revision of the user's permit by the authority, the industrial user must
certify on each report with the statement in division (N)(3) below, that
there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to
activities of the industrial user;



         (h)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to
be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring
requirements of division (D)(1) above, or other more frequent monitoring
requirements imposed by the authority, and notify the authority; and



         (i)   This provision does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.



      (3)   (a)   The City of Shelbyville may reduce the
requirement for periodic compliance reports (See division (D)(1) and 40 CFR
403.12(e)(1)) to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
EPA/state, where the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does
not exceed any of the following:



            1.   Four hundred gallons per day; and



            2.   Organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and



               a.    Organic matter - 0.63 lbm/day



               b.   BOD - 0.52 lbm/day



            3.   Maximum allowable headworks loading.



               a.    CBOD5 - 0.89 lbm/day



               b.   TSS - 1.07 lbm/day



               c.    Ammonia as Nitrogen - 0.15 lbm/day



               d.    Mercury - 0.88 lbm/day



         (b)   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial
users that have in the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as
defined in § 55.064 of this chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not
available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or
pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the
superintendent, decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user
would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period.



      (4)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with division (N)(1) of this section.



      (5)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the
user's discharge.  Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times.  The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.



      (6)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures
prescribed in division (K) of this section, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.



   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
authority of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days
before the change.



      (1)    The authority may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
§ 50.054(E) of this chapter.



      (2)   The authority may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit or a general permit under § 50.056(G) of this chapter or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under §
50.056(D) of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.



      (3)   The authority may deny/condition new or increased
contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the
POTW by the users where such contributions do not meet applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would
cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit.



   (F)   Reports of potential problems.



      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited
to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the authority of the incident.  This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.



      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user
shall, unless waived by the authority, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this subchapter.



      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described in division (1), above.  Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.



      (4)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the
authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a slug discharge.



   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to
obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall
provide appropriate reports to the authority as the authority may require.



   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the authority
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city
performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the
city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling
was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of
this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu
of the industrial user unless it notifies the user of the violation and
requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 



   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The
authority prohibits the discharge of any hazardous waste into the wastewater
disposal system or otherwise to the facilities of the authority.



   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.  If 40 CFR
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical
methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the authority or other parties approved by EPA.



   (K)   Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data
that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.



      (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (2) and (3) below, the
user must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the authority. Where time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.



      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.



      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring
and 90 day compliance reports required in divisions (A) and (C) (40 CFR
403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the authority
may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by division (D)(40
CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.



   (L)   Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to
have been submitted on the date postmarked.  For reports, which are not
mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States
Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.



   (M)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of
this subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying,
all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this subchapter, any additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices
established under § 50.049(F)(4).  Records shall include the date, exact
place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the
samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the
analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. 
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. 
This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the authority.



   (N)   Certification statements.



      (1)   Certification of permit applications, user reports and
initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required
to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in
accordance with § 50.054(G); users submitting baseline monitoring reports
under division (A)(2)(e); users submitting reports on compliance with the
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under division (C); users
submitting periodic compliance reports required by division (D)(1) through
(4), and users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a
pollutant on the basis of division (D). The following certification statement

information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations."



      (2)   Annual certification for non-significant categorical
industrial users. A  facility determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user by the authority pursuant to § 50.046 and § 50.054(G)(3)
must annually submit the following certification statement signed in
accordance with the signatory requirements in § 50.046 under significant
industrial user division (C). This certification must accompany an
alternative report required by the authority:



   “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40
CFR ____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during
the period from ______, ______ to ________, ________ (months, days, year):



      1.   The facility described as ____________________ [facility
name] met the definition of a non significant categorical industrial user as
described in § 50.046;



      2.   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and



      3.   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of
total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.



   This compliance certification is based on the following information.



   ___________________________________



   ___________________________________”



      (3)   Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have
an approved monitoring waiver based on division (D)(2) must certify on each
report with the following statement that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the user.



   “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR _______
[specify applicable national pretreatment standard part(s)], I  certify
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in
the level of ______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the
activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under §
50.057(D)(1) of the city Code of Ordinances.”



   (O)   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where required by the authority.  The
frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard of this subchapter or as determined
necessary by the authority.  The specific parameters to be monitored shall
be prescribed by the authority at the time of approval of the discharge as
provided in division § 50.055(B). All analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto.  (Comment:  Where
40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, “Sampling and
Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Pollutants for
Priority Pollutants,” April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the U.S.
EPA.)



      (1)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all
other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the authority. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the
decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the
industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows:



         (a)   For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;



         (b)   For volatile organics and oil and grease the
samples maybe composited in the laboratory; and



         (c)   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may
be authorized by the authority, as appropriate.



      (2)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring
and 90-day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12 (b) and (d), a
minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the authority may authorize a lower minimum. For
the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12 (e) and (h), the authority shall
require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.



      (3)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting
requirement in 40 CFR 403.12 (e) or (h) monitors any regulated pollutant at
the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the
authority, using the procedures prescribed in 40 CFR 403.12 (g)(5), the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.



      (4)   Notification of change in flow or waste loadings. Any
industrial user which plans to significantly change its waste characteristics
must notify the authority 90 days prior to such change and resubmit the
disclosure form as outlined in § 50.055(B).



      (5)   Baseline report. (See 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)).



         (a)   Within 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative
decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users
subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging
to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW will be required to submit to the
control authority a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR Part
403.12(b)(1) through (7).



         (b)   Upon promulgation of a categorical pretreatment
standard, the control authority (either U.S. EPA, state, or POTW) will
provide the appropriate 12(b) form for distribution to the industrial users
who are affected by the promulgated standard.  The industrial users are then
required to submit the completed report to the control authority.



      (6)   Signatory requirement.



         (a)   All applications, self-monitoring reports, BMR's,
compliance reports, disclosure forms or any other pretreatment form report or
schedule must contain the following certification statement signed by a
responsible corporate official, general partner or proprietor, or other duly
authorized representative:



   "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations."



         (b)   The duly authorized employee must be an individual
or person having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or
the pretreatment program.  This authorization must be made in writing by the
principal executive officer or ranking elected official, and submitted to the
approval authority prior to or together with the report being submitted.

§ 50.058  MONITORING FACILITIES.



   (A)   Each discharger shall provide and operate at the discharger's
own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of each sewer discharge to the authority. Each monitoring
facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except where such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the
authority may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street
or sidewalk area providing that the facility is located so that it will not
be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.



   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.  The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.



   (C)   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained
in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.  Construction shall be completed within 120 days from the
effective date of this subchapter.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.059  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   (A)   The authority shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring necessary
to determine, independent of information supplied by the user, whether the
user is in compliance with all requirements of this subchapter and any
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the authority or its representatives, upon
presentation of credentials of identification, ready access to all parts of
the premises at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties.  The representatives of the city shall observe all safety
rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the company
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city
employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging
and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure
of the company to maintain safe conditions.



      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the authority shall be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.



      (2)   The authority shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct random compliance sampling and/or metering of the user's operations,
independent of information supplied by the user.



      (3)   The authority shall have the right to investigate
instances of noncompliance with this subchapter and any individual wastewater
discharge permit or general permit.  Sample taking and analysis and the
collection of other information, independent of information supplied by the
user, shall be performed with sufficient care to produce evidence admissible
in enforcement proceedings or in judicial actions.



      (4)   The authority may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the user at its own expense.  All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.



      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the authority and
shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be born by
the user.



      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authority access to
the user's premises shall be a violation of this subchapter.



   (B)   Search warrants.  If the authority has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program of the City of Shelbyville designed
to verify compliance with this subchapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, the authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
Circuit or Superior Court of the County of Shelby.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.060  PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical
pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
50.047 of this subchapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
state, or the authority, whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense.  Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the authority for review, and shall be
acceptable to the authority before such facilities are constructed.  The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
chapter.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.061  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   (A)   Information and data furnished to the authority with respect
to nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or
governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary
information of the discharger.  Any such request must be asserted at the
time of submission of the information of data.



   (B)   When requested and demonstrated by a discharger furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this subchapter,
the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state
disposal permit and/or the pretreatment programs provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state
agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger
furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics and
other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and shall be available to the public without
restriction.



   (C)   Information accepted by the authority as confidential shall
not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the
authority until and unless a ten day notification is given to the discharger.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.062  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.



   The authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.  The term SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other
industrial user that violates divisions (C), (D) or (H) of this section) and
shall mean:



   (A)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude)
a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limits as defined in § 50.046;



   (B)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product
of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous
limits, as defined by § 50.046 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);



   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement
as defined by § 50.047 (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the authority determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;



   (D)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;



   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance;



   (F)   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;



   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or



   (H)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the authority determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.063  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Emergency suspension of service.



      (1)   The authority may for good cause shown suspend the
wastewater treatment service to a discharger when it appears to the authority
that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or
substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to
the environment, interfere with the operation of POTW, or violate any
pretreatment limits imposed by this subchapter.  Any discharger notified of
the suspension of the authority's wastewater treatment service shall
immediately and effectively halt or prevent all discharges.  In the event of
failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order
within the specified time, the authority shall commence judicial proceedings
immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with such
order.  The authority shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and
terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the discharger of the
elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the threat
of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.



      (2)   The authority may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears
to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons.  The authority may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present,
an endangerment to the environment.



         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge
shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order,
the authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The authority may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the authority that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in division (B) of this section are
initiated against the user.



         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part,
for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the authority prior to
the date of any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (C) or (D)
of this section.



   (B)   Termination of discharge.



      (1)   The authority may seek to terminate the wastewater
treatment services to any user who violates the following conditions:



         (a)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge
permit or general permit conditions;



         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge;



         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;



         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the discharger's
premises by representative of the authority for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, or sampling;



         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
50.057 of this chapter; or



         (f)   Violation of the conditions of this subchapter, or
any final judicial order entered with respect thereto.



      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination
of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division
(D) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken.  Exercise
of this option by the authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.



   (C)   Notification of violation - administrative adjustment. When
the authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this subchapter including division (B) above, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit  or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority may serve
upon or cause to be served upon that user a written notice of violation
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the authority. Submission
of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the authority to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a notice of violation.



   (D)   Show cause hearing. The authority may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user as defined in § 50.046 and
required by § 50.056(C).  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. The
proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the authority which shall
then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities
of the discharger in accordance with I.C. 4-22-1-14.



   (E)   Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the
authority with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the
provisions of division (B) hereof, the attorney for the authority may,
following the authorization of such action by the authority,  commence an
action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Henry County
Circuit or Superior Court.



   (F)   Enforcement actions - annual publication.



      (1)   A list of all significant dischargers which were the
subject of enforcement proceedings pursuant to this section during the 12
previous months, shall be annually published by the authority in the largest
daily newspaper, published in the municipality in which the authority is
located,  summarizing the enforcement actions take against the dischargers
during the same 12 months who were in significant noncompliance. 



      (2)   A significant industrial user is in significant
noncompliance if its violation meets the criteria in § 55.062.



   (G)   Right of appeal. Any discharger or any interested party shall
have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the
authority on any matter covered by this subchapter and shall be entitled to a
prompt written reply.  In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and
deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which
enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt
of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending
receipt of the aforesaid written reply.  Appeal of any final judicial order
entered pursuant to this subchapter may be taken in accordance with I.C. 
4-22-1-14.



   (H)   Operating upsets.



      (1)   Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations
which places the discharger in a temporary state of non-compliance with this
subchapter shall inform the authority thereof within 24 hours of first
awareness of the commencement of the upset.  Where such information is given
orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger
with the authority within five days. The report shall specify:



         (a)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and
the upset's impact on a discharger's compliance status;



         (b)   Duration of non-compliance, including exact dates
and times of non-compliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by
which compliance is reasonably expected to occur; and



         (c)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions on
non-compliance.



      (2)   A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall
be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the authority
against a discharger for any non-compliance with the subchapter which arises
out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset.



   (I)   Consent orders. The authority may enter into consent orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.  Such documents shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
divisions (J) and (K) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.



   (J)   Compliance orders. When the authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit  or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority
may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that
the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer.  A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.



   (K)   Cease and desist orders. When the authority finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the authority may issue an order
to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.

§ 50.064  BILLING AND COLLECTION OF CHARGES AND RATES.



   (A)   Billing of customer charges. Sewage service bills shall be
rendered once each month or at such times as may be determined hereafter by
the board at the same time as water service bills of the municipal water
utility of said city are, or may from time to time be rendered and shall be
payable at the same time as water service bills of said utility are
payable.  Such sewage service bills shall be based upon the rates and
charges for the use of and service rendered by said sewage works, as
described in Ordinance No 1801 of said city and all ordinances amendatory
thereof and supplemental thereto.  The rates and charges may be billed to
the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served, unless otherwise
requested in writing by the owners; but such billings shall in no way relieve
the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as herein
required.  The owners of the properties served, which are occupied by
tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city
for the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid
by such tenants;  provided that such examination shall be made at the office
at which said records are kept and during the hours that such office is open
for business.



   (B)   Penalty for delinquent payment. The rates or charges made
pursuant to the terms of this subchapter against any lot, parcel or real
estate or building that is connected with and uses such sewage works by or
through any part of the sewage system of the sewage works by or through any
part of the sewage system of the city, or that in any way uses or is served
by such works, shall be a lien, and the same are hereby declared, made and
constituted a lien upon and against any such lot, parcel or real estate or
building.  Such lien, after written notice to the owner of any such lot,
parcel of real estate or building, shall attach as such rates or charges
become due and payable, and shall be superior to and take precedence over all
other liens except the lien for taxes, and shall be enforced as hereinafter
set out. Such rates or charges so established shall be paid within 30 days
after same are due.  If such rates or charges are not paid within said 30
day period after written notice to the owner of any such lot,  parcel or
real estate or building,  the same shall thereupon become and hereby are
declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of such rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto, which rates or charges, together with
the penalty shall be collectible in the manner hereinafter provided.



   (C)   Collection of delinquent charges by County Auditor. It shall
be the duty of the officer of the sewage works of said city, charged with the
collection of such rates or charges, to enforce payment thereof, together
with the penalty hereinabove provided.  Said officer shall from time to time
each year, certify to the County Auditor a list of such rates or charges,
including the amount of the penalty, which have become delinquent.  Such
list shall include the name or names of the owner or owners of each and every
lot, parcel of real estate or building on which such rates or charges have
become delinquent, the description of such premises as shown by the records
of the Office of the County Auditor, and the amount of such rates or charges,
together with the amount of penalty.  It shall be the duty of the County
Auditor to place and include any such rates or charges, including the amount
of the penalty, on the tax list,  roll of taxes or tax duplicate,  in the
appropriate place thereon,  in respect to the premises on which any such
rates or charges and penalty are due and payable in such manner and pursuant
to the terms of Chapter 299 of the Acts of 1945 of the General Assembly of
the State of Indiana and all acts amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto.



   (D)   Foreclosure of lien. In addition to the methods of collection
of such rates or charges, including the penalty thereon, when the same become
delinquent as hereinabove provided, the sewage works shall have the right to
foreclose the lien hereinbefore established.  In all suits brought to
foreclose such lien,  the sewage works shall recover the amount of such
rates on charges and the penalty thereon,  together with a reasonable
attorney's fee, pursuant to the terms of Chapter 299 of the Acts of 1945 of
the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,  and all acts amendatory
thereof or supplemental thereto.



   (E)   Administrative fines.



      (1)   When the authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority may fine
such user in an amount not to exceed $2,500 for the first offense and $7,500
for subsequent offenses. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis.  In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.



      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30
calendar days be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance,
and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 10% per month.  A lien
against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties.



      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the authority to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within 60 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the authority may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event
the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.  The authority may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.



      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.0641  SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.



   (A)   Penalties for late reports. A  penalty of $300 shall be
assessed to any user for each day that a report required by this subchapter,
a permit or order issued hereunder is late, beginning five days after the
date the report is due (higher penalties may also be assessed where reports
are more than 30-45 days late). Actions taken by the authority to collect
late reporting penalties shall not limit the authority's authority to
initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late
reporting violations.



   (B)   Performance bonds. The authority may decline to issue or
reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to any
user who has failed to comply with any provision of this subchapter, a
previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a
sum not to exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be necessary to
achieve consistent compliance.



   (C)   Liability insurance. The authority may decline to issue or
reissue an individual wastewater discharge or a general permit to any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this subchapter, a previous
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.



   (D)   Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The authority may
decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a
general permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines
or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this chapter, a
previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit
or order issued hereunder.



   (E)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this subchapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may
be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the
user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.



   (F)   Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this
subchapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the authority. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of Chapter 93 of the Shelbyville Code of Ordinances
governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City of Shelbyville for
any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.



   (G)   Informant rewards. The authority may pay up to $100 for
information leading to the discover of noncompliance by a user. In the event
that the information provided results in a civil penalty or an administrative
fine levied against the user, the authority may disperse up to 10% of the
collected fine or penalty to the informant.  However, a single reward
payment may not exceed $5,000.



   (H)   Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city.
Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a
user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the authority.



(Ord. 12-2683, passed 8-20-12)



§ 50.0642  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   Upset.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user.  An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if
the requirements of  division (3), below, are met.



      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:



         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset;



         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and



         (c)   The user has submitted the following information
to the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days:



            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance;



            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact
dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance
is expected to continue; and



            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 50.047(A) or the specific
prohibitions in § 50.047(B) of this subchapter if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference
and that either:



      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and
the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the City of Shelbyville was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit,
and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use
or disposal requirements.



   (C)   Bypass definitions.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section,



         (a)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of
wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.



         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of  divisions (3) and (4) below.



      (3)   Bypass notifications.



         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the authority, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.



         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the authority
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written
submission shall also be provided within five  days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned
to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The authority
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within 24 hours.



      (4)   Bypass restrictions.



         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the authority may take
an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless



            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage;



            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



            3.   The user submitted notices as required under
division (3) above.



         (b)   The authority may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (A) of this section.

and refusal to execute the grant of inspection to the city. If the user
continues to refuse to execute a grant of inspection after a period of 60
days, the surcharge shall be raised to $50 per month.



   (H)   In the event a user utilizing the system executes the grant of

violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize the danger to the public, damage to the MS4 or waters of
the state.



      (2)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this
subchapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.  The
violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration
and hearing.



   (B)   Notice of violation.

which such remediation or restoration must be completed.  Said notice shall
advise that should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a contractor and all the
expense shall be charged to the violator.



   (C)   Appeal of notice of violation.  Any person receiving a notice
of violation may appeal, in writing, the determination of the authorized
enforcement agency.  The notice of appeal must be received within 15 days
from the date of the notice of violation.  The Shelbyville Utility Board
shall hold a hearing within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of
appeal.  The decision from the hearing shall be final.



   (D)   Enforcement measures after appeal.  If the violation has not
been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of
violation or deadline set during the appeal hearing, the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and is
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property.  It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
authorized enforcement agency or its designated contractor to enter upon the
premises for the purposes set forth above.



   (E)   Cost of abatement.  Within 30 days after abatement of the
violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of the
abatement, including administrative costs.  The property owner may file a
written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 15 days of
notification.  If the amount due is not paid within 30 days or by the date
expressed by the authorized enforcement agency, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.  A copy of the resolution shall
be turned over to the County Auditor so that he or she may enter the amounts
of the assessment against the parcel as it appears on the current assessment
roll and the tax collector shall include the amount of the assessment on the
bill for taxes levied against the parcel of land.



   (F)   Injunctive relief.  It shall be unlawful for any person to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
subchapter.  If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions
of this subchapter, the authorized enforcement agency may petition the courts
for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from
activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.



   (G)   Compensatory action.  In lieu of enforcement proceedings,
penalties and remedies authorized by this subchapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory
action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops,
creek cleanup and the like.



   (H)   Violations deemed a public nuisance.  In addition to the
enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or
permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter
is a threat to public health, safety and welfare, is deemed a nuisance and
may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense and/or civil
action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance
may be taken.



   (I)   Remedies not exclusive.  The remedies listed in this
subchapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any
applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the
authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

§ 50.105  STORMWATER UTILITY USER FEE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES.



   The stormwater utility user fee shall be based on the relative
contribution of surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the
city’s stormwater system and shall be assessed per RU per month. For the
purpose of this subchapter, a month shall be considered 25 to 35 days. Any
billing for stormwater service outside this time shall be on a per diem
basis. This stormwater utility user fee rate is designed to recover and be
able to pay the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the
stormwater system and shall be the basis for assessment of the city’s
stormwater utility user fee. This rate is established so as to maintain
adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected variations in the
cost of providing services, as well as variation in the demand for services.
This rate shall be evaluated annually as to its sufficiency to satisfy the
needs of the stormwater utility. The following methods may be used to
determine the non-residential factors:



   (A)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using
on-site measurements of the apparent outside boundaries of the parcel or
impervious area in or on such developed parcel, respectively, made by the
city or on its behalf;



   (B)   Computation of the parcel size or impervious area using the
dimensions of the parcel or impervious area in or on the parcels which are
set forth and contained in the records of the office of the Shelby County
Assessor or Addison Township Assessor;



   (C)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the parcel size or
impervious area using aerial photography or photogrammertry, or using the
information and data from the on-site measurements of like or similar
property or features or as contained in the records of the city or county; or



   (D)   Computation of parcel size or impervious area using data
provided by the owner, tenant or developer. The authorized official may
require additional information as necessary to make the determination.

§ 50.107  BILLING AND PAYMENT; PENALTIES.



   (A)   Bills or statements for the stormwater utility user fee shall
be rendered monthly, in accordance with the regular sewage utility billing
cycle, by the utility billing division of the city for all properties
subjected to the fee. Bills shall be payable at the same time and in the same
manner and subject to the same penalties as set forth for the sewer utility.
Any partial payment of a combined utility bill shall be applied first to the
stormwater utility user fee. Any unpaid stormwater utility user fees shall
constitute a lien on such property except the liens of state, county and
municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of such state, county
and municipal taxes. Such lien, when delinquent for more than 30 days, may be
foreclosed by the city in the manner provided by the laws of Indiana for the
foreclosure of mortgages on real property.



   (B)   For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for
other city services, the stormwater utility user fee shall be included in the
monthly sewage utility bill rendered to the established customer.



   (C)   For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other
city services, the bill or statement for the stormwater utility user fee
shall be sent to the stormwater utility user as determined from the tax
rolls. The Director may render annual, semiannual or monthly billings, to be
billed in arrears, to coincide with the property tax schedule, on such
properties if determined to be in the best interest of the city.



   (D)   The owner of a property is ultimately responsible for all fees
imposed under this subchapter.

violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.



         (d)   Filing a suit for civil or criminal penalties
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.

be liable to the authority for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such
violation or discharge.  The authority shall bill the discharger for the
costs incurred by the authority for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work
caused by the violation or discharge.  Refusal to pay the assessed costs
shall constitute a violation of §§ 50.045et seq. enforceable under the
provisions of § 50.063.



      (3)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes
any false statement, representation or certification in any application,

has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of §§ 50.045et seq.,
an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
authority may petition the Circuit or Superior Court of Shelby County through
the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction,
as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, the general permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by §§ 50.045et seq. on activities of the user.  The
authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.



   (5)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in §§
50.045et seq. are not exclusive. The authority may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.  Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City of
Shelbyville's enforcement response plan. However, the authority may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
authority is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.

   (B)   “Wait” or “Don’t Walk”.  No pedestrian shall start
to cross the roadway in the direction of a wait or don’t walk signal, but
any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her crossing on the walk
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 90.01  KEEPING ANIMALS, FOWL, OR BEES.



   (A)   It is a nuisance and shall be unlawful for any person to keep
poultry or pigeons, or maintain any place where poultry or pigeons are kept,
within 200 feet of the dwelling house of any person other than the keeper or
owner of the poultry or pigeons.  This section does not apply to duly
licensed poultry dealers under and pursuant to the laws of the state.



   (B)   It is a nuisance and shall be unlawful for any person to keep
any animal of the horse, cattle, goat, sheep, or swine within 200 feet of the

animals.  However, in territories annexed to the city after July 1, 1956,
this section does not apply to properties which kept such animals prior to
passage of the annexation ordinance, as long as the animals are continuously
maintained on the property.  If the animals are not maintained on the
property for a period of 30 days, the animals may no longer be allowed on the
property.



   (C)   (1)   Where permitted. Beekeeping is allowed as an
accessory use on lot occupied by a single-family residence. Beekeeping for
educational or research purposes by an institution such as a college, high
school or agricultural extension office is allowed in all other zones,
subject to the requirements of this division.



      (2)   Standards applicable to beekeeping. Beekeeping is
subject to the following standards:

feet of any property line, except that a colony may be situated within ten
feet of a side lot line or rear lot line provided the following provisions
are met:



               a.   The beekeeper establishes and maintains
a flyway barrier at least six feet in height consisting of a solid wall,
solid fencing material, dense vegetation or combination thereof that is
parallel to the property line and extends ten feet beyond the colony in each
direction so that all bees are forced to fly at an elevation of at least six
feet above ground level over the property lines in the vicinity of the
colony; or



               b.   The colony is situated ten feet or more
above the grade of the nearest adjoining property line.



         (b)   Colonies shall be maintained in movable-frame
hives with adequate space and management techniques to prevent overcrowding
and swarming.



         (c)   In any instance in which a colony exhibits
aggressive or swarming behavior, the beekeeper must ensure that the colony is
re-queened. Aggressive behavior is any instance in which unusual aggressive
characteristics such as stinging or attacking without provocation occurs.



         (d)   Every beekeeper shall maintain an adequate supply
of water for the bees located close to each hive.

nature whatsoever for a future delivery, or for services to be furnished or

exposes for sale a sample of the subject of the sale or whether he or she is

minor is in violation, then the officer shall issue a written citation to the
minor or offender, charging him or her with violation of this section.  The
officer shall provide a copy of the same to the City Attorney and the City
Attorney may consider further civil prosecution.  Further, as soon as

   VARIANCE.  A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the Zoning Code
where the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where,
owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the
actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the code would result in
unnecessary and undue hardship.  As used in this chapter, a VARIANCE is
authorized only for height, area, and size of structure or size of yards and
open spaces; establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall
not be allowed by variance, nor shall a VARIANCE be granted because of the

materially impedes vision across the yard between the heights of 30 inches
and ten feet.



         (b)   In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing
front yard pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall
be provided on all frontages.  Where one of the front yards that would
normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing
yard pattern, the Board of Public Works and Safety may waive the requirement
for the normal front yard, and substitute therefore, a special yard
requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided on
adjacent lots.



         (c)   In the case of corner lots, a front yard of the
required depth shall be provided in accordance with the prevailing yard
pattern and a second front yard of the depth required generally for front
yards in the district shall be provided on the other frontage.



         (d)   In the case of corner lots with more than two
frontages, the Board of Public Works and Safety and the Plan Commission shall
determine the front yard requirements, subject to the following
limitations:  at least one front yard shall be provided having the full
depth required generally in the district; no other front yard on the lot
shall have less than half the full depth required generally.



         (e)   Depth of required front yards shall be measured at
right angles to a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot
lines.  The foremost point of the side lot line, in the case of rounded
property corners at street intersections, shall be assumed to be the point at
which the side and front lot lines would have met without the rounding.



      (3)   YARD, SIDE.  A yard extending from the rear line of the
required front yard to the rear lot line, or in the absence of any clearly
defined rear lot line, to the point on the lot farthest from the intersection
of the lot line involved with the public street.



         (a)   In the case of through lots, side yards shall
extend from the rear lines of front yards required.



         (b)   In the case of corner lots, yards remaining after
full front yards have been established shall be considered side yards.



         (c)   Width of a required side yard shall be measured in
such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width
required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side
lot line.



      (4)   YARD, REAR.  A yard extending across the rear of the
lot between inner side yard lines.



         (a)   In the case of through lots and corner lots, there
will be no rear yards, but only front and side yards.



         (b)   Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in
such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width
required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the rear
lot line.



      (5)   YARD, SPECIAL.  A yard behind any required yard
adjacent to a public street, required to perform the same functions as a side
or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither
the term side yard nor the term rear yard clearly applies.  In such cases,
the Board of Public Works and Safety and Plan Commission shall require a yard
with minimum dimensions, as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard
in the district.

structure is oriented on the lot in such a manner that the placement of the
accessory structure in order to meet the setback requirements would render
the structure useless or undesirable, it shall be within the authority of the
Zoning Administrator to determine an allowable reduction in setbacks.  The
following factors will be considered when making that determination:

§ 150.045  M-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.



   (A)   The intent of Light Industrial Districts (M-1) is to provide
space for certain commercial and a wide range of industrial uses and
structures which are able to meet certain performance standards to protect
nearby non-commercial and non-industrial uses from undesirable environmental
conditions.  Residential and other similar uses are prohibited from this
district in order to limit environmental effects associated with certain
commercial and industrial uses, irrespective of their meeting performance
standards.



   (B)   The following principal uses and structures shall be permitted
in Light Industrial Districts (M-1).



      (1)   Any industrial use which can meet the performance
standards for this district set forth below, provided it is not specifically
prohibited.



      (2)   Wholesale, storage, and warehouse uses.



      (3)   On-site and off-site signs.



      (4)   Agricultural uses.



      (5)   Automobile service stations.



   (C)   The following accessory uses and structures shall be permitted
in Light Industrial Districts (M-1).



      (1)   Caretaker and watchmen quarters.



      (2)   Medical facilities accessory to an industrial use.



   (D)   After the provisions of this chapter relating to special
exceptions  have been  fulfilled, the Board of Zoning Appeals and Board of
Public Works and Safety may permit, as special exceptions in Light Industrial
Districts (M-1), any use which is consistent with the intent of this district
and which is not prohibited.



   (E)   All residential dwellings of any kind, and all other uses
which are not specifically permitted, cannot meet the performance standards
for industry, or are not permissible as special exceptions, shall be
prohibited.



   (F)   To be a permitted industrial use in Light Industrial Districts
(M-1), whether as a permitted use or as a special exception, the use must
meet the following performance standards.



      (1)   Physical appearance.  All operations shall be carried
on within an enclosed building; however, new materials or equipment in
operable condition may be stored in the open.  Normal daily wastes of an
inorganic nature may be stored in containers not in a building when the
containers are not readily visible from the street.  Junk, salvage, auto
wrecking, and similar operations shall be shielded from the view from streets
and from adjacent properties in another district by means of a sturdy,
sight-obscuring, ten-foot high fence in good repair and two rows of alternate
planted evergreen trees.



      (2)   Fire hazard.  No operation shall involve the use of
highly flammable gasses, acid, liquids,



grinding processes, or other inherent fire hazard.  This provision shall not
be construed to prohibit the use of normal heating fuels, motor fuels, and
welding gasses when handled in accordance with other city laws.



      (3)   Noise.  No operation shall be carried on which involves
noise in excess of the normal traffic noise of the adjacent street at the
time of the daily peak hour of traffic volume.



         (a)   Noise shall be measured at the property line; when
the level of noise cannot be determined by observation with the natural
senses, a suitable instrument may be used and measurement may include
breakdowns into a reasonable number of frequency ranges.



         (b)   All noises shall be muffled so as not to be
objectionable due to intermittence, beat frequency, or shrillness.



      (4)   Sewage and liquid wastes.  No operation shall be
carried on which involves the discharge into a sewer, water course, or the
ground of liquid wastes of any radioactive nature, or liquid wastes of a
chemical nature which are detrimental to normal sewage plant operation or
corrosive and damaging to sewer pipes and installations.



      (5)   Air contaminants.  Air contaminants and smoke shall be
less dark than designated Number One on the Ringelmann Chart as published by
the United State Bureau of Mines; however, smoke of a density designated as
Number One shall be permitted for one four-minute period in each  hour.



         (a)   Light-colored contaminants of such as opacity as
to obscure an observer’s view to a degree equal to or greater than the
aforesaid shall not be permitted.



         (b)   Particulate matter of dust as measured at the
point of emission by any generally accepted method shall not be emitted in
excess of .2 grains per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of 500° F.,
except for a period of four minutes in any  hour, at which time it may equal
but not exceed .6 grains per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of
500° F.



         (c)   Due to the fact that the possibilities of air
contamination cannot reasonably be  comprehensively covered in this 
section, there shall be applied the general rule that there shall not be
discharged from any sources whatsoever quantities of air contaminants or
other material in such a quantity as to cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or
annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the public in general;
to endanger the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any considerable number
of persons or to the public in general; or to cause or have a natural
tendency to cause injury or damage to business, vegetation, or property.



      (6)   Odor.  The emissions of odors that are generally agreed
to be obnoxious to any considerable number of persons, shall be prohibited.



         (a)   Observations of odor shall be made at the property
line of the establishment causing the odor.



         (b)   As a guide to classification of odor, it shall be
deemed that strong odors of putrefaction and fermentation tend to be
obnoxious and that odors associated with baking or the roasting of nuts and
coffee shall not normally be considered obnoxious within the meaning of this
chapter.



      (7)   Gases.  The gases sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide
shall not exceed five parts per million.  All nitrous fumes shall not exceed
one part per million.  Measurements shall be taken at the property line of
the particular establishment involved.



      (8)   Glare and heat.  All glare, such as welding arcs and
open furnaces, shall be shielded so that they shall not be visible from the
property line.  No heat from furnaces or processing equipment shall be
sensed at the property line to the extent of raising the temperature of air
or materials more than 5° F.



      (9)   Vibration.  All machines, including punch presses and
stamping machines, shall be mounted so as to minimize vibration; in no case
shall vibration exceed a displacement of 3/1,000 of an inch measured at the
property line.  The use of steam or broad hammers shall not be permitted in
this district.



   (G)   The minimum lot area shall be 10,000 square feet.  The
minimum lot width shall be 80 feet.



   (H)   There shall be a front yard of not less than a depth of 25
feet.  There shall be a rear yard of not less than a depth of 20 feet. Each
side yard shall be not less than ten feet; however, on lots adjacent to a
residential district, all buildings shall be located so as to provide a
minimum side and rear yard of 25 feet along that portion of the lot adjacent
to the residential district.



   (I)   The maximum lot coverage for all buildings shall be not more
than 50% of the total lot area.



   (J)   The height of all buildings and structures shall not exceed 50
feet.



   (K)   Any new industry, building in the area not previously
industrial in use, shall submit to the Board of Public Works and Safety an
environmental impact study, including discussion of those items included in
division (F) of this section.

FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT



§ 150.055  PURPOSE.



   The purposes of this subchapter are as follows.



   (A)   Control floodplain uses such as fill, dumping, storage of
materials, structures,  buildings,  and any other works which, acting alone
or in combination with other existing or future uses, will cause damaging
flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing valley storage.



   (B)   Protect human life and health.



   (C)   Minimize public and private property damage.



   (D)   Protect individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.



   (E)   Minimize surface and ground-water pollution which will affect
human, animal, or plant life.



   (F)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in
combination with similar developments, create an unjustified demand for
public investment in flood-control works, by requiring that uses vulnerable
to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, shall be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.



   (G)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in
combination with similar development, cause flood losses if public streets,
sewer, water, and other utilities must be extended below the flood level to
serve the development.



   (H)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in
combination with similar development, create an additional burden to the
public to pay the costs of rescue, relief, emergency preparedness measures,
sandbagging, pumping, and temporary dikes or levees.



   (I)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in
combination with similar development, create an additional burden to the
public for business interruptions, factory closings, disruption of
transportation routes, interference with utility services, and other factors
that result in loss of wages, sales, production, and tax write-offs.



   (J)   Provide for public awareness of the flooding potential.



   (K)   Help maintain a stable tax base by the preservation or
enhancement of property values for future floodplain development.  In
addition, development of future flood-blight areas on flood- plains will be
minimized and property values and the tax base adjacent to the floodplain
will be preserved.

§ 150.056  CAUSES OF FLOOD LOSS.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of  commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in flood heights and velocities and the occupancy of flood
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazards to other lands which
are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages.

§ 150.057  METHODS OF ANALYZING FLOOD HAZARDS.



   This subchapter relies upon a two-step process for reasonably analyzing
the flood hazard affecting specific lands.



   (A)   The official zoning map adopted as part of this subchapter
provides the first step in delineating a General Flood Plain District. The
basis of this delineation is the 1981 Shelbyville Flood Insurance Study,
which along with the accompanying flood boundary, floodway maps, flood
insurance rate maps, and any revisions thereto are adopted by reference to be
part of this section.



   (B)   The second step involves a determination of the flood hazard
at the site of any proposed special- permit use.  All uses other than
open-space uses are special-permit uses under the terms of § 150.060, and
require a case-by-case evaluation by the Board of Natural Resources which
shall, where applicable:



      (1)   Estimate the discharge of the regulatory flood which is
representative of large floods known to have occurred in this region and
which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this subchapter.  It is in the general order
of a flood which could be expected to occur on the average once every 100
years.



      (2)   Determine the specific flooding threat at the site of
the proposed special-permit use and determine whether the use is located in a
floodway or floodplain area by the following procedures.



         (a)   Calculation of water-surface elevations and flood
protection elevations based upon a hydraulic analysis of the capacity of the
stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.  Flood
protection elevations shall be two feet above the water-surface elevations of
the regulatory flood.



         (b)   Computation of the floodway required to convey
this flood without increasing flood heights to an extent which would cause
substantial




upstream or downstream damage to existing or reasonably anticipated future
development.



      (3)   Evaluate the effects of the proposed use upon the public
health, safety, and general welfare in light of the standards and purposes of
this subchapter, and deny, grant, or conditionally grant the application for
the proposed use.

§ 150.058  SCOPE OF DISTRICT; FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.



   (A)   This subchapter shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map as being located
within the boundaries of the General Floodplain District.



   (B)   The regulatory flood-protection elevation and necessary
floodway areas shall be established by the Board of Natural Resources.

§ 150.059  PERMITTED USES.



   The following uses having a low flood damage potential and no
obstructing flood flows, shall be permitted within the Floodway District to
the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided
they do not require structures, fill, or storage of materials or equipment. 
However, no use shall adversely affect the capacity of the channels or
floodways of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.



   (A)   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing,
outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry,
sod farming, and wildcrop harvesting.



   (B)   Private and public recreational uses such as golf courses,
tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat-launching
ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish
hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting
and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.



   (C)   Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, and play areas.

§ 150.060  SPECIAL-PERMIT USES.



   (A)   All uses other than those specified in § 150.059 are
permitted only on application to the Zoning Administrator and the issuance of
a special permit by the Natural Resources Commission of the state and the
Board of Zoning Appeals.



   (B)   The General Floodplain District encompasses both floodway and
flood fringe areas.  Therefore, the Natural Resources Commission of the
state shall determine whether the proposed special-permit use is located
within a floodway or flood fringe area. If it is determined that the proposed
use is located within the floodway, the provisions of § 150.061 shall
apply.  If it is determined that the proposed use is located within the
flood fringe, the provisions of § 150.065 shall apply.  All uses shall be
subject to standards contained in this subchapter.

SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS



§ 150.105  HEIGHT REGULATIONS FOR OBSTRUCTIONS.



   (A)   On a corner lot in all districts except Central Business,
nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a
manner as materially to impede vision between a height of 2 and 10 feet above
the centerline grades of the intersecting streets, in the area bounded by the
street lines of corner lots and a line joining points along the street lines
30 feet from the point of the intersection.



   (B)   Except at the rear of lots abutting on an alley, no solid
fences shall be erected to a greater height than four feet above the
ground.  At the rear of lots abutting on alleys, solid fences or walls may
be erected to a height of not more than six feet above the ground. Partition
fences on the lot line between two lots may be erected to a maximum height of
six feet; however, no fence shall be allowed on the lot line if it will
result in the limitation or restriction of access to any structure which is
existing on one of the lots, and shall not be constructed from barbed wire,
razor wire, be electrified, contain sharp edges or be unsafe in any other
fashion.  Any person desiring to construct any fence taller than six feet
must apply for a building permit through the Office of the Building
Commissioner, and the fence shall meet all requirements as if it were a
permanent structure.  The total height of that portion of the fence between
the front yard setback line and the street line shall not exceed 3 feet. 
The use of barbed wire is prohibited.  No fence, in any circumstance, shall
be constructed in the city, or its jurisdictional areas which contains barbed
wire, razor wire, be electrified, contain sharp edges or be unsafe to any
person.  This does not apply to fences which are to be constructed in
approved agricultural zones and are used for livestock management.  The
Zoning Administration shall be empowered to review each circumstance as
needed concerning the construction of the fences.  Any fence which currently
exists in the city, or its jurisdictional area which is to be repaired or
altered must be brought into compliance with the current fence standards. 
An exception for barbed wire will be granted to commercial and industrial
establishments that wish to include the wire as an incidental use to the
construction of or repair of a fence which is in existence, or of new
construction. In no case shall a fence constructed entirely of barbed wire be
allowed except as otherwise noted for agricultural uses.



   (C)   The height limitations contained in this chapter shall not
apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators,
domes, chimneys, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above
roof level and not intended for human occupancy.  Should objects of the type
described above exceed the height limitations of the zoning district in which
they are desired, a variance must be obtained from the Board of Zoning
Appeals prior to construction of the object(s).

   (A)   A townhouse structure may be established within specified
districts according to the restrictions and procedures of those specified
districts.



   (B)   However, it is recognized that townhouses are not readily
regulated by yard and lot requirements.  Therefore, exceptions to yard and
lot requirements for townhouse structures may be decided by the Board of
Public Works and Safety and the Plan Commission using the provisions and
conditions for granting special exceptions established in §§ 150.155 and
150.156, subject to the following restrictions.



      (1)   It is not the intent of this section to increase total
housing density.  If dwelling unit lots are smaller than would normally be
permissible in the specified zoning district, usable public open space or
landscaping shall be provided in an amount so that the sum of the open space
plus the sum of the lots shall equal or exceed the required lot area.



      (2)   This section shall not be interpreted to allow
townhouses in zoning districts other than as specified by that district.

Manufactured homes shall also have exterior siding and roofing materials
which are characteristic of other homes in the neighborhood where it will be
located.  Manufactured homes shall have a permanent underfloor space
enclosure.

§ 150.115  SPACE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   In any zoning district where residential dwellings are
permitted, no dwelling unit shall be constructed or placed that contains less
than 950 square feet of dwelling space for a single-family dwelling, or 600
square feet of dwelling space per dwelling unit for structures that contain
two or more dwelling units.  Attached garages are not to be included in the
computation of dwelling space.  The exception of this requirement is mobile
homes, which may have a minimum floor space area of 900 square feet.



   (B)   In established mobile home parks, where lot sizes or other
existing conditions prohibit the placement of a mobile home that would
conform to all other standards except the minimum dwelling space requirement,
the Zoning Administrator may allow a smaller mobile home if, in that
persons’ opinion, the prevailing characteristics of other existing mobile
homes in the park are similar in size to that home which is being considered
for placement.  Should the applicant feel aggrieved by the Zoning
Administrator’s decision, or should the Zoning Administrator feel that the
request is not warranted, the applicant may appeal by applying for a variance
through the Board of Zoning Appeals as outlined in § 115.162.

REGULATIONS FOR NONCONFORMITIES



§ 150.125  INTENT.



   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter, or
amendments that may be adopted later, there exist lots, structures, uses of
land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this
chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment.  It is the
intent of this chapter to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.  It is further the
intent of this chapter that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.



   (B)   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.  A nonconforming
use of structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of additional
signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other
uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.



   (C)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently.  Actual construction
is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.



   (D)   Where excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the
excavation, demolition, or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work is carried on diligently.

§ 150.126  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.



   (A)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter.  The lot must be in separate ownership and not
of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This
provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, if the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which the lot is located.  Variance of yard requirements shall
be obtained only through action on the Board of Zoning Appeals.



   (B)   If two or more lots, or combination of lots and portions of
lots, with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time
of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of
this chapter.  No portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established
by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.

   Where, at the time of passage of this chapter, lawful use of land
exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this
chapter, and where the use involves no individual structure with a
replacement cost exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, provided the following requirements are met.



   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.



   (B)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.



   (C)   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS



§ 150.140  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this
subchapter are to:



      (1)   Encourage the location of towers in
non-residential/non-historical areas to minimize the total number of towers
throughout the communities.



      (2)   Enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community
quickly, effectively and efficiently.



      (3)   Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing
tower sites.



      (4)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them,
to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is
minimal.



      (5)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them
in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of towers and antennas.



   (B)   Antennas and towers may be considered either a principal or
accessory uses on an industrial or commercially zoned lot. A different
existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the
installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining
whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district
development regulations, including but not limited to, setback requirements,
lot size and coverage requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall
control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels
within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are
installed, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter shall not be
deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.



   (C)   Each applicant for approval of an antenna and or tower shall
provide to the Zoning Administrator, as defined in § 150.156, an inventory
of its existing antennas and towers that are either within the city
jurisdictional area, or within a half mile of the border thereof,  including
specific information about the location, height and design of each tower or
antenna. Applicants are encouraged to submit an inventory of potential or
future tower sites within the jurisdictional area of the city.  The Zoning
Administrator may share such information with other applicants applying for
administrative approvals or special exceptions/variances under this
subchapter or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within
the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the
Zoning Administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way
representing or warranting such sites are available or suitable.



(`81 Code, § 150.102)  (Ord. 98-2285, passed 3-2-98)



§ 150.141  ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS.



   The Zoning Administrator may approve the following uses after
conducting an administrative review:



   (A)   Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a
tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other free
standing, non- residential structure) that is more than 50 feet in height, so
long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the
existing structure;



   (B)   Installing an antenna on an existing non- residential
structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water
tower, utility pole or other free standing, non-residential structure) in any
commercial or industrial district that is less than 50 feet in height so long
as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the existing
structure;



   (C)   Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height,
including a preexisting tower and further including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with
the antenna, so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet
to the height of the existing tower;



   (D)   Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district
other than industrial or commercial, that, in the judgment of the Zoning
Administrator, is in conformity with the goals set forth by the comprehensive
Plan of the city;



   (E)   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with
the tower or antenna, in any industrial or commercial zoning district;
provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any existing
off-site residence or previously platted residential lot lines a distance
equal to the height of the tower. Engineering certification shall be
submitted that states the structure’s construction will cause the tower to
crumble inward so that in the event of collapse no damage to structures on
adjoining zoning lots will result. The following § 150.142 of this
subchapter shall be used in deciding applications for approval of new towers
in commercial and industrial districts: divisions (A), (B), (C), (D), (E),
(G), (I), (J), (K) and (M).



   (F)   Replacing an existing tower which adds no more than 20 feet to
the overall existing height of the existing structure.



(`81 Code, § 150.103)  (Ord. 98-2285, passed 3-2-98)



§ 150.142  TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS SPECIAL USE CRITERIA.



   Telecommunication companies are encouraged to locate telecommunications
antennae on or in structures other than a tower. Such structures may include
church steeples, transmission line towers, utility/light poles, water towers,
and the like. Where such facilities are not available, co-location of
facilities is encouraged.  When a new tower is proposed to be sited, a
determination of whether the location will provide minimal level of coverage
versus optimal coverage shall be taken into consideration. The following
standards shall be used in the approval of the siting of new towers:



   (A)   Evidence that the applicant has investigated the possibilities
for locating the proposed facilities on an existing tower, the use of stealth
technology or location in another district where the tower would be permitted
as an administratively approved use where a minimal level of coverage can be
provided. Such evidence shall consist of:



      (1)   Copies of letter sent to owners of all existing towers
within a one mile radius of the proposed site requesting the following
information:



         (a)   Tower height;



         (b)   Existing and planned tower uses;



         (c)   Whether the existing tower could accommodate the
proposed antenna without instability or radio frequency interference; and



         (d)   If the proposed antenna cannot be accommodated on
the existing tower, an assessment of whether the existing tower could be
structurally strengthened or whether the antenna’s transmitters and related
equipment could be protected from electromagnetic interference, and a general
description of the means and projected cost of shared use of the existing
tower.



      (2)   A copy of all responses within 30 days of the mailing
date of the letter required in division (A)(1); and



      (3)   A summary explanation of why the applicant believes the
proposed facility cannot be located on an existing tower.



      (4)   A summary explanation of why the applicant believes that
the use of an alternative tower structure is not possible.



      (5)   Provision of sound engineering evidence demonstrating
that location in the proposed district is necessary in the interest of the
public safety or is a practical necessity.



   (B)   Evidence that the communications tower is structurally
designed to support at least one additional user, and the special use
application includes a statement that the owner of the tower is willing to
permit other user(s) to attach communication facilities, on a commercially
reasonable basis, which do not interfere with the primary purpose of the
tower. The tower owner may require that such other users agree to negotiate
regarding reasonable compensation to the owner from any liability which may
result from such attachment. The site plan shall indicate a location for at
least one equipment building in addition to that proposed for use by the
applicant. Priority for co-location on the proposed tower shall be given to
antennas that will serve a public safety need for the community.



   (C)   In order to provide spatial separation and create visual block
from adjacent properties and streets, a buffer shall be installed around the
outside of all improvements on the site, including the tower and guy anchors,
any ground buildings or equipment, and security fencing. Ground buildings
located in a residential district may be located outside the buffered area if
they are constructed so the exterior appearance of the building has the
appearance of a residential dwelling, including pitched roof and frame or
brick veneer construction. The tower’s guy anchors may be screened or
fenced separately in order to comply with the requirements of this division.



   (D)   The base of the tower and each guy anchor shall be surrounded
by a security fence or wall at least eight feet in height unless the tower
and all guy anchors are mounted entirely on a building over eight feet in
height. The tower’s guy anchors may be screened separately in order to
comply with the requirements of this division.



   (E)   No outside storage shall be allowed on any telecommunications
facility site.



   (F)   Associated buildings located in any residential district shall
not be used as an employment center for any worker. This provision does not
prohibit the periodic monitoring of equipment and instruments.



   (G)   The telecommunications tower shall meet all applicable Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) standards and shall not interfere with air
traffic or air travel from or to any existing or proposed airport. Any
lighting shall not project onto surrounding residential property.



   (H)   The minimum lot size requirements shall be in accordance with
the zoning district where the tower is proposed to be located or the setback
requirements of division (I), whichever is greater.



   (I)   The color of the tower shall be neutral, except to the extent
required by federal law, so as to minimize its visual impact.



   (J)   In order to protect the public from unnecessary exposure to
electromagnetic radiation, the tower owner shall provide documentation, such
as a signed affidavit, indicating that the power density levels do not exceed
levels permitted by the FCC.



   (K)   No commercial advertising shall be allowed on the tower or its
related facilities.



   (L)   Setback of the base tower from all adjacent property lines
shall be one foot for each foot in height. To encourage the shared use of
facilities, applications for towers which will operate with more than one
user immediately upon completion may have a 10% reduction in the required
setbacks, but in no case shall the setback be less than those required for
the underlying zoning district. Also, to encourage the construction of
monopole structures, monopole towers may have a 20% reduction in the required
setbacks. To encourage location of towers in forested areas with a minimum
depth of 65 feet, the tower may have a 20% reduction in the required
setbacks. In no case shall the setback be less than those required for the
underlying zoning district. The setback reductions shall only be allowed upon
a professional engineering certification which states that the structure’s
construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that in the event of a
collapse no damage to structures on adjacent zoning lots will result.



   (M)   Notice shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator when the
tower is placed out of service. Towers which are not used for a period of six
months or more shall be removed by the owner within 120 days of the receipt
of notification to that effect. Should the aforementioned tower not be
removed as required, the city may remove the tower and assess all reasonable
costs of the removal to the owner of the property where the tower is located.



   (N)   Telecommunications towers and associated equipment and
buildings shall not be allowed in any residential district or business
district with the zoning of B-1 or B-3 as defined in this chapter, without
fulfilling one of the following requirements:



      (1)   That the proposed location is in accordance with§
150.141; or



      (2)   A special exception is granted in accordance with §
150.161.

§ 150.162  APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.



   (A)   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any
person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city
affected by any decision of the Administrative Officer.



      (1)   Appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as
provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the officer from whom the
appeal is taken and with the Board of Zoning Appeals a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof.



      (2)   The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.



         (a)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal has been
filed with him or her that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a
stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.



         (b)   In this case, proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.



      (3)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to the parties in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable
time.  Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person, or by agent or
attorney.



   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and
decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official or agency based
on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation, any regulation
relating to the location or soundness of structures, or the interpretation of
any map.



   (C)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power, where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece
of property at the time of the enactment of this chapter, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions, or any other extraordinary and
exceptional situation or condition of the piece of property, the strict
application of any regulation under this chapter would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardships
upon the owner of the property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the
property, a variance from the strict application so as to relieve the
difficulties or hardship, if the relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent
and purpose of this chapter.



      (1)   No variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it
finds that the strict application of the chapter would produce undue
hardship; the hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity; the authorization of the variance
will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character
of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and the
granting of the variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and
exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of
convenience, profit, or caprice.



      (2)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds
that the condition, situation, or intended use of the property concerned is
not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the
formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this
chapter.



      (3)   A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until the following
conditions are met.  A written application for a variance is submitted
demonstrating that special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 
Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under the terms of this chapter.  The special conditions and circumstances
do not result from the actions of the applicant.  Granting the variance
requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is
denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district.



      (4)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.



      (5)   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in §
150.113, and the public hearing shall be held.



         (a)   Any party may appear in person, or by agent or
attorney.



         (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make findings
that the requirements of this section have been met by the applicant for a
variance, that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting
of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.



         (c)   The Board shall also make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.



      (6)   In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter.  Violation of conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable.



      (7)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the district.



   (D)   In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed, and may make the order,
requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made.  To that end,
the Board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken.  The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any officer,
or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variance in this
chapter.

buildings regarding the following criteria:



      (1)   Building silhouette - similar pitch and scale to a roof
line.



      (2)   Spacing between building facades - setbacks or notches
between primary facades that frame the structure.



      (3)   Setback from property line - building setback and/or
primary facade setback from the property line.



      (4)   Proportion of windows, bays, doorways, and other
features - vertical or horizontal elements tied together in bands across
facade lengths.



      (5)   Proportion of primary facade - size of facades similar
in area and height to width ratios.



      (6)   Location and treatment of entryway - to provide
important visual commonality between structures.



      (7)   Exterior materials used - similar materials and
treatment add to detail and monumentality of a building.



      (8)   Shadow patterns from decorative features - the light and
dark surfaces from materials used and projections from windows, bays and
setbacks create visual breaks.



      (9)   Building scale - similarity of building height and
configuration.



      (10)   Landscaping - ties together buildings and defines space.

APPENDIX:  DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR LARGE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS



Procedure



   The following standards and guidelines are intended to be used as a
design aid by developers proposing large retail developments in community
shopping centers or as uses-by-right and as an evaluation tool by city staff
and the Plan Commission and Zoning Board in their review processes. These
standards and guidelines apply to all projects for retail establishments of
more than 25,000 square feet as uses-by-right. “Standards” denoted by (+)
are mandatory, while “Guidelines” denoted by (o) are not mandatory, but
are provided in order to educate planners, design consultants, developers and
city staff about the design objectives. These standards and guidelines are to
be used in conjunction with all other development criteria.



   The Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals is empowered to grant
variances to the mandatory (+) standards under the following circumstances:



   1.   The strict application of the standard would result in peculiar
and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue hardship upon
the owner of the affected property.



   2.   The alternative site planning and building design approach
meets the design objectives as stated in the standard, equally well or better
than would compliance with the standard.



   3.   In either of the foregoing circumstances, the variance may be
granted without substantial detriment to the public good.



Article 1.  Aesthetic Character



1.   Facades and exterior walls



GUIDELINE: Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the
uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual
interest that will be consistent with the community’s identity, character
and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale that city residents
will be able to identify with their community. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



   a.   Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally,
shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at
least 3% of the length of the faced and extending at least 20% of the length
of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100
horizontal feet.



   b.   Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have
arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along
no less than 60% of their horizontal length.

2.   Smaller retail stores



GUIDELINE: The presence of smaller retail stores gives a “friendlier”
appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the
range of the site’s activities. Windows and window displays of such stores
should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades. The
standards presented in this section are directed toward those situations
where additional, smaller stores with separate, exterior customer entrances
are located in principal buildings. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



Where principal buildings contain additional, separately owned stores which
occupy less than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area with separate,
exterior customer entrances:



   a.   The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent
between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for
no less than 60% of the horizontal length of the building facade of such
additional stores.



   b.   Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent
sills, shutters or other such forms of framing.



3.   Detail features



GUIDELINE: Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that
provide visual interest at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive
aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the
following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric and not
superficially applied trim, graphics, or paint. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



Building facades must include a repeating pattern that shall include no less
than three of the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall
repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than
30 feet either horizontally or vertically.



Color change



Texture change



Material module change



Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no
less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.



[Click here to view image.]



4.   Roofs



GUIDELINE: Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest to and
reduce the massive scale of large buildings. Roof features should complement
the character of adjoining neighborhoods. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



Roofs shall have no less than two of the following features:



   a.   Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as
HVAC units from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not
exceed 15% of the height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not
at any point exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. Such
parapets shall feature three- dimensional cornice treatment.



   b.   Overhanging eaves extending no less than three feet past the
supporting walls.



   c.   Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls with an average slope greater than or equal to one foot of
vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal run and less than or equal
to one foot of vertical rise for every one foot of horizontal run.



   d.   Three or more roof slope planes.



5.   Materials and colors



GUIDELINE: Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant part
of the visual impact of a building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically
pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in adjoining
neighborhoods. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



   a.   Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality
materials.



      These include, without limitation:



      brick



      wood



      sandstone



      other native stone



      tinted, textured, concrete masonry units



   c.   Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or
earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black
or fluorescent colors is prohibited.



   d.   Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors,
including primary colors, but neon tubing shall not be an acceptable feature
for building trim or accent areas.



   e.   Predominant exterior building materials should not include the
following:



      smooth-faced concrete block



      tilt-up concrete panels



      pre-fabricated steel panels



6.   Entryways



GUIDELINE: Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation
and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The standards identify
desirable entryway design features. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible
customer entrances featuring no less than three of the following:



   a.   canopies and porticos



   b.   overhangs



   c.   recesses/projections



   d.   arcades



   e.   raised corniced parapets over the door



   f.   peaked roof forms



   g.   arches



   h.   outdoor patios



   i.   display windows



   j.   architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are
integrated into the building structure and design



   k.   integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped
areas and/or places for sitting



Where additional stores will be located in the principal building, each such
store shall have at least one exterior customer entrance which shall conform
to the above requirements.



7.   Back and side facades



GUIDELINE: All facades of a building which are visible from adjoining
properties and/or public streets should contribute to the pleasing scale
features of the building and encourage community integration by featuring
characteristics similar to the front facade. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



All building facades which are visible from adjoining properties and/or
public streets shall comply with the requirements of Article I, 1. of these
Design Standards and Guidelines.



ARTICLE II. Site Design and Relationship to the Surrounding Community



1.   Entrances



GUIDELINE: Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple
building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian
and bicycle access from public sidewalks and provide convenience where
certain entrances offer access to individual stores or identified departments
of a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls
and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face
bordering land uses. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public
street shall feature at least one customer entrance. Where a principal
building directly faces more than two abutting public streets, this
requirement shall apply only to the two sides of the building including the
side of the building facing the primary street and another side of the
building facing the second street.



2.   Parking lot orientation



GUIDELINE: Parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and efficient
access. They should be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten
the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the
overall scale of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer to
streets, the scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is
encouraged and architectural details take on added importance. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



No more than 50% of the off-street parking area for the entire property shall
be located between the front facades of the principal building(s) and the
primary abutting street.



3.   Back sides



GUIDELINE: The rear or sides of buildings often present an unattractive view
of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units, garbage receptacles
and other such features. Architectural and landscaping features should
mitigate these impacts.



STANDARD: (+)



The minimum setback for any building facade shall be 35 feet from the nearest
property line. Where the facade faces adjacent residential uses, an earthen
berm no less than six feet in height, containing at a minimum evergreen trees
planted at intervals of 20 feet on center or in clusters or clumps shall be
provided.



4.   Outdoor storage, trash collection, and loading areas



GUIDELINE: Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise
impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from
adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed or
enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts,
the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the
problem. Appropriate locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include
areas between buildings where more than one building is located on a site and
such buildings are not more than 40 feet apart or on those sides of buildings
that do not have customer entrances. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



   a.   Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or
compaction, loading or other such uses shall not be visible from abutting
streets.



   b.   No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction,
loading or other such uses shall be located within 20 feet of any public
street, public sidewalk or internal pedestrian way.



   c.   Loading docks, trick parking, outdoor storage, utility meters,
HVAC equipment, trash collection, trash compaction and other service
functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and
the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions
are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public
streets, and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of
screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal
materials of the building and landscape.



   d.   Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal
inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences.
Materials, colors and design of screening walls and/or fences and the cover
shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the
building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to
those used as predominant materials and colors on the building.



5.   Pedestrian flows



GUIDELINE: Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the
neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development
to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets forth
standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems
that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian
safety, shelter and convenience within the center grounds. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



   a.   Sidewalks at least 8 feet in width shall be provided along all
sides of the lot that abut a public street.



   b.   Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than eight
feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to
the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a
minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as
but not limited to transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry
points and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees,
shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers or other such materials for no
less than 50% of its length.



   c.   Sidewalks, no less than eight feet in width, shall be provided
along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer
entrance and along any facade abutting public parking areas. Such sidewalks
shall be located at least six feet from the facade of the building to provide
planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as
arcades or entryways are part of the facade.



   d.   Internal pedestrian walkways provided in conformance with part
(b) above shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or
arcades within 30 feet of all customer entrances.



   e.   All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from
driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface
materials such as pavers, bricks or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian
safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways.



6.   Delivery/loading operations



GUIDELINE: Delivery and loading operations should not disturb adjoining
neighborhoods or other uses. (o)



STANDARD: (+)



No delivery, loading, trash removal or compaction or other such operations
shall be permitted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless the
applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such
operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of 45 db as measured
at the lot line of any adjoining property.

MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN



    § 151.10  SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.



       (A)   The Plan Commission shall impose the following general
requirements and compel subdividers to comply with the following principles
of design in the layout and construction of subdivisions. All plats shall be
prepared by a registered professional engineer or land surveyor.



   (B)   If the Plan Commission finds that land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad
drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, and other conditions that may
increase the danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or
flood hazards; and, if from adequate investigations, conducted by all the
public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest
of the public the land should not be platted and developed for the purpose
proposed, the Plan Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for meeting the
problems that will be created by the subdivision and development of the land.



   (C)   The Plan Commission may refuse to approve what it considers to
be scattered or premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or
injury to the public health, safety, welfare, or prosperity by reason of lack
of adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads and
transportation facilities, or other public services; or which would
necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such
services (such as undue maintenance costs for adequate roads) .

§ 151.11  STREETS.



       (A)   Conformity to the circulation plan. The widths and
locations of all street rights-of-way in a proposed subdivision shall conform
to the major streets and highways plan.



   (B)   Street extensions.



      (1)   The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall
provide for the continuation or projection of streets and alleys already
existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided.



      (2)   Where, at the determination of the Plan Commission, it
is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed
streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of the
properties.  Where the Plan Commission deems it necessary, dead-end streets
shall be provided with a temporary turn-around approved by the Plan
Commission.



      (3)   The street system for the proposed subdivision shall
provide for extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in
no case shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width
required in these regulations for a street in its category.



   (C)   Dedication of right-of-way for new streets. The dedication of
right-of-way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be as
shown on the major streets and highways plan, or, if not shown thereon, shall
meet the following standards.

      (2)   All streets classified as arterial streets by the major
streets and highways plan shall have all points of access approved by the
Plan Commission.  Marginal access streets or frontage roads may be required
by the Plan Commission for subdivisions fronting on arterial streets.



      (3)   Through proposed business areas, street widths shall be
increased ten feet on each side if needed, to provide parking without
interfering with normal traffic movements.



   (D)   Dedication of right-of-way for existing streets. 
Subdivisions platted along existing streets after the effective date of this
chapter shall dedicate additional right-of-way, if necessary, to meet the
minimum street width requirements set forth in division (C) of this section.



      (1)   The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated
where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the
subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, ½ of the
required right-of-way width, measured from the center line of the existing
roadway, shall be dedicated.



      (2)   Dedication of one-half of the rights-of- way for
proposed streets along the boundaries of land proposed for subdivision shall
be prohibited.



   (E)   Intersections.  In general, all streets shall join each other
so that for a distance of at least 100 feet the street is approximately at
right angles to the street it joins.



      (1)   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of
at least 20 feet.  Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb
having a desirable radius without reducing the sidewalk at a street corner to
less than normal width, the property line at the street corner shall be
rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit the curb construction.



      (2)   No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on, and has
access to, either a collector or a local access street shall have a service
drive, curb cut, or other means of access to an arterial street within 75
feet of the right-of-way of any street which intersects the arterial street
on the side on which the lot or parcel is located.



   (F)   Curves in streets, horizontal and vertical.



      (1)   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial streets.



      (2)   Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten
degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to
insure safe sight distance shall be made.  The minimum radii of curves shall
be as follows.

      (3)   Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical
curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of 200 feet.



            (a)   Sight distance is the measurement from a
driver’s eyes, which are assumed to be 3.75 feet above the pavement
surface, to an object six inches high on the pavement.



            (b)   Profiles of all streets showing natural and
finished grades, drawn to an approved scale, will be required by the Plan
Commission and the Board of Public Works and Safety.



   (G)   Street grades and elevations.  Street grades shall conform to
the following standards.

      (1)   All streets shall be designed so to provide for the
discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by
grading and drainage.  For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall
be not less than .5%.



      (2)   The Plan Commission shall not approve the streets which
will be subject to inundation or flooding.



         (a)   All streets must be located at elevations which
will make them flood-free in the event of a 100-year flood.



         (b)   Where flood conditions exist, the Plan Commission
shall require profiles and elevations of streets in order to determine the
advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.



         (c)   Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in
order to provide flood-free streets, if the fill does not unduly increase
flood heights.



         (d)   Drainage openings shall be designed so as not to
restrict the flow of water and thereby unduly increase flood heights.



   (H)   Marginal access streets.  Where the proposed subdivision
abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on
which traffic volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety
considerations, the Plan Commission may require that marginal access streets
be provided in order that no lots front directly on the existing or proposed
arterial street or highway.



   (I)   Dead-end (culs-de-sac).  Minor terminal or dead-end streets
or courts which are designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall
not be longer than 600 feet.  Such streets shall be provided at the closed
end with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of the pavement of at
least 50 feet and a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least 60
feet.  The cul-de-sac shall be a geometric shape so as to contain a 100-foot
diameter circle.



   (J)   Street names.  Proposed streets which are obviously
extensions of already existing and named streets shall bear the names of the
existing streets.  The name of a proposed street which is not an extension
of an existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive,
place, court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.



   (K)   Private streets and reserve strips.  There shall be no
private streets platted within a  subdivision. There shall be no reserve
strips in a subdivision except where their control is definitely vested in
the city or county under conditions approved by the Plan Commission as
authorized in these regulations.

§ 151.12  BLOCKS.



   (A)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet, or be less than 300
feet, except as the Plan Commission considers necessary to secure efficient
use of land or desired features of street layout.



   (B)   Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth.  However, where this would require lots to front on an
arterial street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of
the property prevent two tiers of lots, the Plan Commission may approve a
single tier of lots of minimum depth.

§ 151.13  LOTS.



   The following provisions shall pertain; however, modifications may be
permitted in planned unit developments.



   (A)   Lots shall be designated by numbers. Streets, avenues, and
other grounds shall be designated by names or numbers.



   (B)   Relationship to streets.  All lots shall front on a public
street or road for a minimum distance of 50 feet.  However, lots which front
on the turnarounds of permanent dead-end streets shall have a minimum
distance of 50 feet between side property lines at the front building line.



   (C)   Arrangement.  Except where not feasible, side lot lines shall
be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.



   (D)   Dimensions. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be
such as the Plan Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and
use contemplated.  Lot dimensions within the jurisdiction of this chapter
shall conform to the requirements of Chapter 150.



   (E)   Building line setback.  The building line to establish yards
for all buildings and lots shall be as provided in Chapter 150.



   (F)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall have sufficient extra width
to meet the building setback lines of 25 feet from the building line,
established on both the front street and side street.



   (G)   Yard requirements.  Yard requirements for residential
subdivisions or the portions thereof within the jurisdiction of this chapter
shall be the same as the yard requirements set forth in Chapter 150 for the
zoning district or districts in which they are located.



   (H)   Flood hazards.  Land subject to flooding, and land deemed to
be topographically unsuitable for residential development shall not be
platted for residential use or for any other use which may increase the
danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazards.



      (1)   Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on
the plat for those uses that will not be endangered by periodic or occasional
inundation contrary to the public welfare.



      (2)   To insure that lots will be located only where they will
provide flood-free house sites, the Board of Public Works and Safety may
require the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to
demonstrate that the house sites will be completely free from the danger of
flooding.



      (3)   If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed
subdivision, the plat plan shall provide for an easement or right-of-way
along the stream for a floodway.



         (a)   For smaller streams, the plan shall also provide
for channel improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within
banks.



         (b)   The floor elevations of houses shall be high
enough to be well above the 100-year flood.



         (c)   The floodway easement shall be wide enough  to
provide for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become
more highly developed and run-off rates are increased.

§ 151.14  OFF-STREET LOADING  AND PARKING FACILITIES.



   In commercial and industrial subdivisions, in the portions of
residential subdivisions reserved for commercial or industrial uses, and the
lots or parcels platted for commercial or industrial uses, lots or parcels
platted for commercial or industrial sites shall be large enough to provide
for off-street loading and unloading facilities and off-street parking
facilities as provided in § 150.112.

§ 151.15  UTILITY AND DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.



   (A)   Easements are required as necessary for poles, wires,
conduits, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas mains, water mains, and other
utilities.  In general, street rights-of-way or a 12-foot easement centered
along rear lot lines shall be provided for this purpose.  No structures of
any kind shall be constructed on an easement.



   (B)   Where the Plan Commission deems it necessary for proper
drainage within or through a subdivision, it shall require that a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way be provided.

§ 151.16  COMMUNITY ASSETS.



   In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features
such as large trees, unusual rock formations, and water courses; for sites
which have historical significance; and for similar assets which, if
preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to the
community. The Plan Commission may prepare a list of all features which it
deems worthy of preservation.

    § 151.17  CONFORMANCE WITH ZONING AND OTHER REGULATIONS.



   No final plat of land will be approved unless it conforms with Chapter
150. Whenever there is a variance between the minimum standards set forth in
these regulations and those contained in the Zoning Code, Building Code, or
other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

    § 151.18  PUBLIC OPEN SPACES.



       (A)   A minimum of 4% of the gross area of any subdivision or
planned development shall be reserved for parks and playground sites.



   (B)   Park and playground sites shall be dedicated to the city to be
reserved for public use.



      (1)   The Plan Commission after consulting with the Parks
Department, however, shall have the option to determine whether, to accept
the park site or a contribution to the park and recreation fund of the city
in a sum of money equal to the appraisal of the fair market value of the park
area prior to the time of platting, or the purchase price paid by the
developer if the property was purchased within 12 months of the date the date
of platting. The sum of money collected shall be placed in the park fund of
the city to provide recreational areas and facilities. No plat shall be
approved and no building permit shall be issued by the city within any
subdivision or planned development until either the park site is dedicated to
the city or all contribution monies are paid in full.



      (2)   In the event the city accepts that dedication of land as
park and playground sites, the following standards shall apply.



         (a)   No local open space may be less than 20,000 square
feet in area, nor larger than 12 acres, except when stream valley parks,
storm drainage, utility easements, or green buffers are included with the
written permission of the Plan Commission, or as provided below.



         (b)   Any area or segment of an open space less than 100
feet in width cannot be calculated as local open space unless it is clearly
part of an overall open space system. For example, a linear pedestrian system
linking larger, open spaces could be included in the calculation.



         (c)   A lower minimum than 20,000 square feet or a
higher maximum than 12 acres may be authorized by the Plan Commission,
particularly if practical difficulties or unusual hardship would be entailed
by the application of the required standards. Such difficulties may include
cases in which one area somewhat greater than 12 acres will clearly give
better use than two areas of less than 12 acres each.



         (d)   When open space land is stream valley or
floodplain or without sufficient adequately- sized and reasonably level areas
for selected active recreation use, the city may require that additional land
of a suitable nature be provided even though the total required is more than
the regularly required amount.



         (e)   Developers of adjoining subdivisions may cooperate
in allocating open space for joint use by all residents of the subdivisions
concerned. Where this is done, size, location, and design are subject to Plan
Commission approval.



         (f)   Required local open space must meet the definition
of usable open space. Land in public utility easements may be included in the
open space provision to the full extent that the use of the land is not
restricted for recreation purposes. To the extent that it is restricted,
additional land must be designated by the developer.



         (g)   Although the provision of local open space is
always desirable, there are some situations in which the provision is not
mandatory. These are summarized as follows.



            1.   A lot or tract in a previously approved
subdivision.



            2.   Lot or tract which is too small to
accommodate six dwelling units.



            3.   A single ownership site which is less than ½
acre in size.



         (h)   Upon receipt of an application for a subdivision
or planned development within the city, the Plan Commission Director shall
forward a copy of such application to the Parks Department.

4-19-99) Penalty, see § 151.99



§ 151.26 STREETS.



   (A)   Grading specifications. All streets, roads, and alleys shall
be graded to their full widths by the subdivider so that street pavements and
sidewalks can be constructed on the same level plane. Deviation from this
standard due to special topographical conditions will be allowed only with
the special approval of the Plan Commission.



      (1)   Preparation of the subgrade. Before grading is started,
the entire right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all tree stumps,
roots, brush, and other objectionable materials and of all trees not intended
for preservation. The subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled, and
uniformly compacted to conform with the accepted cross-section and grades.
The subgrade shall be a minimum of three inches of compacted aggregate, as
per engineering specifications.



      (2)   Cuts. In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic
material, soft clay, spongy material, and other objectionable materials shall
be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the graded surface. Rock,
when encountered, shall be sacrificed to a depth of at least 12 inches below
the graded surface.



      (3)   Fills. In fills, all tree stumps, boulders, organic
material, soft clay, spongy material, and other objectionable material shall
be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the natural ground surface.
This objectionable matter, as well as similar matter from cuts, shall be
removed from the right-of-way area and disposed of in such a manner that it
will not become incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of the
drainage system.



   (B)   Minimum pavement widths. Pavement widths shall be measured
from back of curb, to back of curb.



      (1)   Minimum pavement widths to be provided are as follows.



 

 
Major arterial
 
48 feet and up


 
Arterial
 
36


 
Collector
 
36


 
Local access
 
26



 



      (2)   The Plan Commission shall require up to ten feet of
additional pavement width to accommodate an anticipated heavy use of on
street parking spaces in an R-1 and R-2 zoning district with a density equal
to or greater than 4.0 dwelling units per gross acre.



   (C)   Pavement specifications for streets. The subdivider shall
provide street pavements which shall be designed to carry the expected
traffic and which shall conform with the standard specifications of the State
Highway Commission for portland cement concrete pavement or bituminous
concrete pavement.



   (D)   Curbs and gutters. The subdivider shall provide curbs and
gutters. Curbs shall be constructed in conformance with Standard
Specifications of the State Highway Commission as amended. Backfill shall be
higher than the curb and shall slope toward the curb in order to insure that
surf ace water drains into the storm drainage system.



   (E)   Sidewalks. For the safety of pedestrians in residential and
commercial subdivisions, the subdivider shall build portland cement concrete
sidewalks on both sides of the street to meet the following specifications.



      (1)   Single-family or duplex housing developments. Four feet
wide and four inches thick.



      (2)   Multi-family or group housing developments. Five feet
wide and four inches thick.



      (3)   Commercial developments. Ten feet wide and four inches
thick.



      (4)   Where sidewalks are crossed by driveways, the walks
shall have a minimum thickness of six inches. The time of the installation
shall be negotiated with the Board of Public Works and Safety.



(`81 Code, § 151.026)  (Ord. 1612, passed 10-6-75) Penalty, see § 151.99



§ 151.27  UTILITY AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES.



       (A)   Sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water distribution,
electrical, gas, telephone, and communications cable, and other utility lines
shall be installed underground. These utility lines shall be installed in
12-foot wide rear lot easements or they shall be installed within the unpaved
portions of the street right-of-way, except for sanitary and storm sewer
lines which may be installed in the paved portion of the street right-of-way
if it is impossible to install them in the unpaved portion. When it is
impossible to install sanitary and storm sewer lines in the unpaved portion
of the street right-of-way, the following procedure shall be adhered to.
Following the grading of the street, prior to the application of any pavement
base, all utility lines, including service connections, shall be completely
installed, and inspected and approved by the Building Inspector. Where
sanitary and storm sewer lines are to be installed in the unpaved portion of
the street right-of- way, the subdivider may be permitted to delay the
installation of service connections, provided, that at the time these service
connections are installed, they may be installed without breaking or
weakening the existing pavement. Where rock is known to exist beneath the
pavement area at a depth as to interfere with the installation of service
connections, the complete installation of service connections shall be
required prior to the application of any pavement base.



   (B)   Water supply improvements. Where the public water supply is
reasonably accessible or available to the proposed subdivision, as determined
by the Board of Public Works and Safety, the subdivider shall construct a
complete water distribution system which shall adequately serve all lots,
which shall include appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and which shall be
properly connected with the public water supply system. Where a public water
supply system is not reasonably accessible to the subdivision, the subdivider
shall be required to install alternate water supply facilities approved by
the City Engineer. Where individual lot wells are to be installed, lot
dimensions shall meet the approval of the City Council. In any case, water
supply facilities shall be installed as required by standards and
specifications as approved by the County Board of Health.



   (C)   Sanitary sewer improvements. The subdivider shall construct a
complete sanitary sewer system which shall adequately serve all lots and
which shall be properly connected to the public sanitary sewer system. Where
a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible to the
subdivision, the subdivider shall install alternate sanitary sewer facilities
which shall be approved by the Plan Commission and the County Health Officer.
In any case, sanitary sewer facilities shall be installed as required by
standards and specifications as approved by the State Board of Health. No
connection draining storm-water runoff shall be made to a sanitary sewer.



   (D)   Storm drainage. The subdivider may be required by the Board of
Public Works and Safety to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or
surface water that may exist either previous to, or as a result of the
subdivision.



      (1)   These drainage facilities shall be located in the street
right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width.



      (2)   A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each
case, be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire
upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. Locations
and size of culverts shall be determined when construction plans are
prepared. Where surface storm drainage flow is concentrated, permanently
maintainable facilities, which can include vegetation, shall be provided to
prevent significant erosion and other damage or flooding on site or on
adjacent property.



      (3)   The City Engineer shall approve the design and size of
facility based on anticipated runoff from a ten-year storm under conditions
of total potential development permitted by Chapter 150 in the watershed.



          (4)   The subdivider’s engineer shall also study the
effect of each subdivision on the existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivisions. This study shall be reviewed by the
City Engineer.



      (5)   Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility during a five-year storm, the Board of Public
Works and Safety shall not approve the subdivision until provision has been
made for the improvement of the condition.



      (6)   Open drainage systems shall not be allowed in the front
yards of new development within the jurisdictional areas of the city unless
specifically requested of and granted by the Plan Commission.



      (7)   Swale construction and design shall be performed as
required and specified in the city detailed standards.

§ 151.28  STREET NAME SIGNS.



   The Board of Public Works and Safety shall require the installation of
durable street name signs at all intersections, as approved by the City
Engineer or the Traffic Improvement Department, and supplied by the developer.

§ 151.29  COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   After the final plat of any subdivided area has been approved
by the Plan Commission, but before it has been recorded, the subdivider shall
post with the Clerk-Treasurer a performance bond, as defined in § 151.002.
The subdivider shall then make and install improvements listed above,
constructed in a manner approved by the Plan Commission and the Board of
Public Works and Safety. All improvements shall be completed within one year
of final plat approval by the Plan Commission.



   (B)   The performance bond shall be conditioned on the payment of
all construction costs incurred in making the improvements by the subdivider,
any expense incurred by the city for engineering and legal fees, and other
expenses in connection with the making of the improvements.



   (C)   In lieu of final completion of the improvements and in lieu of
entering into a contract with the city to insure completion of the
improvements within one year, the improvements may be installed as otherwise
provided by law. In the event of unforeseeable circumstances, an additional
time period for development may be negotiated.

§ 151.30  VARIANCES.



   (A)   The Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a variance to
this chapter where, by reason of the unusual shape of a specific piece of
property, or where, by reason of exceptional topographical conditions, the
strict application of these regulations would result in extreme practical
difficulties and undue hardship upon the owner of the property.



      (1)   Such relief may be granted only if it is without
detriment to the public good and does not substantially impair the intent and
purpose of this chapter.



      (2)   In granting such variances or modifications, the Board
of Public Works and Safety may require conditions that will substantially
secure the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.



      (3)   Financial disadvantage to the property owner is not
proof of hardship within the purpose of this chapter.



   (B)   A comprehensive group housing, commercial, or industrial
development, including the large-scale construction of housing, commercial,
or industrial units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be
approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety although the design of the
project does not include standard street, lot, and subdivision arrangements,
provided departure from the standards of these regulations can be made
without destroying their intent and is in accordance with the provisions of
the Zoning Code relating to planned development.



   (C)   Where a proposed subdivision would contain no more than five,
but not less than two parcels or plots of land and no new streets, the
procedure of preparing a preliminary plat may be waived by the Board of
Public Works and Safety.

(`81 Code, § 157.02)  (Ord. 1744, passed 10-5-81)



§ 157.03  AIRPORT ZONES.



   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there
are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical
zones as they apply to a particular airport.  These zones are shown on the
city municipal airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by A & E
Engineering, Inc. and dated January 6, 1981, which is incorporated and made a
part hereof as if fully set forth herein.  An area located in more than one
of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation.



   (B)   The various zones are established and defined as follows.



      (1)   Utility runway visual approach zone.  The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250
feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250
feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface.  Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.



      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum
greater than ¾ mile non-precision instrument approach zone.  The inner edge
of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
500 feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary
surface.  Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.



      (3)   Transitional zones.  These zones are established as the
area beneath the transitional surfaces.  These surfaces extend outward and
upward to 90 degree angles to the runway centerline, with the runway
centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot
vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they
intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional zones for those
portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the
limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured
horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90 degree angles to
the extended runway centerline.



      (4)   Horizontal zone.  This zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface
of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to
those arcs.  The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.



      (5)   Conical zone.  This zone is established as the area
that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward
therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.  The conical zone does not
include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones.



(`81 Code, § 157.03)  (Ord. 1744, passed 10-5-81)



§ 157.04  HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or
tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
established for that zone.  The applicable height limitations are
established for each of the zones in question as follows.



      (1)   Utility runway visual approach zone.  Slopes upward 20
feet horizontally for each foot vertically, beginning at the end of, and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



      (2)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum
greater than ¾ mile non-precision instrument approach zone.  Slopes upward
34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically, beginning at the end of, and
at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



      (3)   Transitional zones.  Slopes upward and outward seven
feet horizontally for each foot vertically, beginning at the sides of, and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zones and
extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 804
feet above mean sea level.  In addition to the foregoing, there are
established height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally
for each foot vertically, beginning at the sides of, and at the same
elevation as the approach zones, and extending to where they intersect the
conical surface.



      (4)   Horizontal zone.  The height limitation is 150 feet
above the airport elevation, or a height of 954 feet above mean sea level.



      (5)   Conical zone.  Slopes upward and outward 20 feet
horizontally for each foot vertically, beginning at the periphery of the
horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to
a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation, as shown on the hazard
map.  This conical zone shall continue to slope outward and upward 20 feet
horizontally for each foot vertically for a distance of 13,000 feet beyond
the 350 foot contour to an elevation of 1,000 feet above airport elevation.



   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height as
per the limitations established in this section.

   Pursuant to I.C. 8-21-10-3(b), until a permit has been issued by the
State Department of Transportation, no person may erect a residential
building or other building designed for noise-sensitive uses within an area
lying 1,500 feet on either side of the extended centerline of a runway for a
distance of one nautical mile from the boundaries of any public use
airport.  Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the
more restrictive limitation shall prevail.

§ 157.06  USES WHICH CREATE HAZARD PROHIBITED.



   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this chapter in a manner
so as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes
of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing,
takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.

§ 157.07  NONCONFORMING USES.



   (A)   The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of
any structure or tree not conforming to these regulations as of 10-5-81, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.  Nothing
contained in this chapter shall require any change in the construction,
alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration
of which was begun prior to 10-5-81, and is diligently prosecuted.



   (B)   Notwithstanding the provision of division (A), the owner of
any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of any markers and lights
deemed necessary by the city municipal airport to indicate to the operators
of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of airport
hazards.  These markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the city.



(`81 Code, § 157.07)  (Ord. 1744, passed 10-5-81)  Penalty, see § 157.99



§ 157.08  PERMIT FOR FUTURE, EXISTING, AND NONCONFORMING USES.



   (A)   Future uses.  No material change shall be made in the use of
land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or
otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor has
been applied for and granted.



      (1)   A permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and
conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal
distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when the tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would
extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone.



      (2)   Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose
for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particulars to determine
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations prescribed in this chapter.  If the determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted.



   (B)   Existing uses.  No permit shall be granted that would allow
the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming
use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it
was on 10-5-81; on the effective date of any amendments to this chapter; or
than it is when the application for a permit is made.  Except as indicated,
all applications for a permit shall be granted.



   (C)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed.  Whenever the
Board of Aviation Commissioners determines that a nonconforming tree or
structure has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow the
structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the zoning regulations.

   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the
Board of Aviation Commissioners for a variance from these regulations. 
Variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application
or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship, and relief granted would not be contrary to the public
interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit
of this chapter.

may, if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
chapter and is reasonable under the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city
municipal airport, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain
thereon any markers and lights necessary to indicate to pilots the presence
of an airport hazard.

before such catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose or location.



      (5)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is
likely to fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby
injure persons or damage property.



      (6)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member,
appurtenance, or ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient
strength or stability or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place
so as to be capable of resisting a wind pressure of one- half of that
specified for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location
without exceeding the working stresses permitted for such buildings.



      (7)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped,
buckled, or settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions
have materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in
the case of similar new construction.



      (8)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, because of dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty
construction; the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; the
deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or any other cause, is
likely to partially or  completely collapse.



      (9)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is
being used.



      (10)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical
structural members list, lean, or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line
passing through the center of gravity does not fall inside the middle
one-third of the base.



      (11)   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the
foundation, shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting
member or members, or 50% damage or deterioration of its nonsupporting
members, enclosing or outside walls or coverings.



      (12)   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged
by fire, wind, earthquake, or flood or has become so dilapidated or
deteriorated as to become an attractive nuisance to children, or freely
accessible to persons for the purpose of committing unlawful acts.



      (13)   Whenever any building or structure has been
constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any specific requirement
or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the
building regulations of this city, or of any law or ordinance of this state
or city relating to the condition, location or structure of buildings.



      (14)   Whenever any building or structure which, whether or
not erected in accordance with all applicable laws or ordinances has in any
nonsupporting part, member, or portion less than 50%, or in any supporting
part, member, or portion less than 66% of the strength, fire-resisting
qualities or characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities or
characteristics required by law in the case of a newly constructed building
of like area, height, or occupancy in the same location.



      (15)   Whenever a building or structure used or intended to be
used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation,
decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or
sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the County Health
Officer to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition
that is likely to cause sickness or disease.



      (16)   Whenever any building or structure, because of
obsolescence, dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits,
lack of sufficient fire-resistant construction is determined by the Fire
Chief to be a fire hazard.



      (17)   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains
on a site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS
OF FACT, PURPOSE AND
OBJECTIVES; DEFINITIONS



§ 159.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Indiana Legislature has in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore,
the City Council of the City of Shelbyville does hereby adopt the following
floodplain management regulations.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Shelbyville are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



   (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
inadequately floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters.



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage.



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.



   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains;



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
flood blight areas.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.05  DEFINITIONS.



   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   A ZONE.  Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both, In A
zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below:



      (1)   ZONE A: Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.



      (2)   ZONE AE AND A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the
1% annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood
elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps
in place of Zones A1-A30.)



      (3)   ZONE AO: Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths
are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.



      (4)   ZONE AH: Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between
one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown within this zone.



      (5)   ZONE AR:  Areas that result from the decertification of
a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in
the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.



      (6)   ZONE A99: Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (appurtenant structure). A structure with a floor
area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of
the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal
initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to
have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds



   ADDITION (to an existing structure).  Any walled and roofed expansion
to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a
common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.



   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.  A designated AO or AH Zone on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.



   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.



   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary
between Kentucky and Indiana.



   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.



   BUILDING.  See STRUCTURE.



   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   CRITICAL FACILITY.  A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   D ZONE.  Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but
flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating
communities but is not required by regulation in this zone.



   DEVELOPMENT.



      (1)   Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate including but not limited to:



         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a
structure or any addition to a structure;



         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site,

         (h)   Any other activity that might change the
direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.



      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the
maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting,
re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or
the construction of permanent structures.



   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings, or columns (posts and piers).

either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.



   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and

   FEMA.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   FLOOD.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and
rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.



   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory
floodway.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.



   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See FLOOD.



   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).  The elevation of the regulatory flood
plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA.  See FREEBOARD.



   FLOODPLAIN.  The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland,
lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the
regulatory flood. The FLOODPLAIN includes both the floodway and the fringe
districts.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including
but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.



   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD- PROOFING).  A method of protecting a
structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities
and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.



   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.  A form used to certify compliance for
non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional
engineer or architect.



   FLOODWAY.  The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to
efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood
of any river or stream.



   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.



   FRINGE.  Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.



   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this chapter). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All
of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required
to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local
flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal
and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after
June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.



   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the
new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the
six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.



   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A general term used to refer to the
several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be
accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter
of Map Revision (LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F).

the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood
zones, delineations, and elevations.



      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).  An
official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides
FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been
elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.



   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:



         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize
the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to
doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has
more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;



         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at
least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom
of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior

any location is as defined in § 159.11. The REGULATORY FLOOD is also known
by the term BASE FLOOD, ONE-PERCENT (1%) ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR
FLOOD.



   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.



   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,
as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a

body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances
that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or
occupancy in flood prone areas.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction
of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the
City of Shelbyville are generally identified as such on the Shelby County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 5,
2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas
are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).



   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed
by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or
any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.



   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.



   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.



   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.



   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.



   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.



   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.



   ZONE A. See A ZONE.



   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and
C.)

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 159.10  LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.



   This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas
within the jurisdiction of the City of Shelbyville.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.11  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.



   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below.



   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits
for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Shelbyville
shall be as delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study of Shelby County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the
corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 5, 2014 as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.



   (B)   The regulatory fiood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits
for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Shelbyville,
delineated as an "A Zone" on the Shelby County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 5, 2014 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best
data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources;
provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one
square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the
party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current
engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved.



   (C)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.



   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any
more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be
utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing
all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.12  ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with
the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in areas of special flood hazard.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.13  COMPLIANCE.



   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within
the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.14  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.15  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
ELEVATIONS.



   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site
shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not
be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.16  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions
shall be:



   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;



   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;



   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.17  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this  chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the City of Shelbyville, the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.18  SEVERABILITY.



   If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the chapter is held to
be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then
said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of
this chapter.

hydraulic engineering study is required and any watercourse changes submitted
to DNR for approval and then to FEMA as a Letter of Map Revision. (See §
159.22(B)(6) for additional information.)



   (B)   Construction stage.



      (1)   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated
structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted.
The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any
further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure
to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work
order for the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the
elevation certification shall be at the applicant's risk.



      (2)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review
the floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.34  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.



   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 159.11, are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with ail pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction
of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary
river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial
addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)



   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development
Permit, provided the provisions contained in §§ 159.30 through 159.37 have
been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if
any) shall take precedence.



   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory
flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or
pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.



   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.35  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.



   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in §§ 159.30 to 159.37 have been met. The key
provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially
improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.



(Ord. 14-2755, passed 10-17-14)



§ 159.36  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
AND/OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.



   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.



      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the
proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided
the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive
than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
and the provisions contained in §§ 159.30 to 159.37 have been met.



   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square
mile:



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual
chance flood elevation for the site.



      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§ 159.30 to 159.37 have been met.



   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

CHAPTER 160:  STORMWATER EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL



Section



   160.01   Introduction and purpose



   160.02   Definitions



   160.03   Permits

   160.06   Enforcement



§ 160.01  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water.  Eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish
and other desirable species.  Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers
and ditches and the dredging of lakes.  In addition, clearing and grading
during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat.



   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard
persons, protect property and prevent damage to the environment in the
city.  This chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of
any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
results in the movement of earth on land in the city.



(Ord. 04-2514, passed 10-4-04)



§ 160.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   BMP or BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. An activity or structure that helps
improve the quality of storm water runoff.



   CLEARING.   Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover.



   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.   Land-disturbing activities associated with
the construction of infrastructure or structures.  CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY
does not include routine ditch or road maintenance or minor landscaping
projects.



   CONSTRUCTION PLAN.   An ordered collection of drawings, narratives,
data and documents assembled for review, approval, authorization and
establishment of guidelines for the initiation, management and completion of
construction activities at a project site regulated by this chapter.  A
storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) is a part of the construction
plan.



   CONSTRUCTION PROJECT SITE.   The physical location(s) or legal
boundaries within which a construction activity or a series of construction
activities is planned to be or is being accomplished.
