plumbing and mechanical, requires the issuance of a permit by the Village. The request for permit
must be accompanied by drawings showing the work to be accomplished and an estimate of the total
cost of the project. All general commercial and residential building contractors to include siding,
window and gutter contractors must register with the Village each fiscal year. All electrical, plumbing,
and mechanical contractors must present a current license issued by the States of Illinois and/or Iowa.
Roofing contractors, however, must present a current Roofer’s License issued by the State of Illinois.
All contractors must also present current proof of General Liability and Worker’s Compensation
insurance, and a current bond of $10,000 made out to the Village of Coal Valley. No permit will be
issued until a current license, proof of insurance and bond are on file with the Village.
b. Residents who acquire a permit under their signature, and will do the work themselves, assume all
responsibility that the work to be performed meets all Village adopted Codes and Ordinances, and
accept all liability for any issues with the work. Professional sub contractors hired by a resident must
meet the permitting, licensing, insurance, and bonding requirements set forth above.
c. No permits will be issued to anyone owing money to the Village of Coal Valley.
d. Permit fees shall be paid in advance at the Village Hall before work has started. Any work started
without a permit shall be charged twice the normal permit fee.

One-Story detached accessory structures used as tool and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses,
provided the floor area does not exceed 120 square feet.
Decks not exceeding 200 square feet in area, that are not more than 30 inches above grade at any point,
are not attached to a dwelling and do not serve the exit door required by section R311.4 of
the International Residential Code.
Section 7. INSPECTIONS.
a. All work requiring a permit under the Chapters or adopted Codes in this Ordinance will require
an inspection by a Village Inspector. At the time various inspections (stake out, footings, roughin,
framing, dry wall, ice barrier, cover, final, etc.) are required, the permit holder will only call
Village Hall requesting the inspection. Calls requesting an inspection directly to an Inspector will
not be accepted. The Village will endeavor to make inspections as quickly as possible (i.e. ice
barrier on roofs), but the Village has two (2) business days once the call is received to make the
requested inspection. Work that is done without inspection can be pulled out, uncovered or
undone at the direction of the Inspector to insure conformance with Village Ordinances and/or
adopted Codes. All Inspectors will contact Village Hall with results of their inspection as soon as
possible. All Inspectors will attach a sticker on the electrical panel board, when installed, to
indicate the date of, and the results of the inspection.
b. Stop Order. All Village Inspectors or their designated representatives have the authority to issue
a verbal or written stop order on any work (new construction, remodel, renovation, alteration,
repair, etc.) being performed in the Village when Village Ordinances or adopted Codes are being
violated or not properly followed. Work will not restart until the appropriate Village Inspector or
his designated representative has given a verbal or written order to do so.
c. Entry Powers. For the purpose of making an inspection, Village Inspectors shall have the power
to make or cause to be made entry at any reasonable hour onto any property, building, residence
or premises where the work of constructing, altering, remodeling, and repairing any building or
structure is going on or to determine if any such work is being performed.
Section 8. ENFORCEMENT.
The Building Inspector of the Village or his designated representative shall be responsible for the proper
administration and enforcement of the Building and Residential Codes.

The owner, occupant or leasee served with an order to repair or change under the Chapters or adopted
Codes in this Ordinance shall have ten (10) days to make such repairs or changes as
required.
Section 10. REFUSAL TO ISSUE PERMITS.
The willful failure, neglect or refusal of any person or company to conform to the adopted
International/National Building, Residential, Electrical, Mechanical Codes, or State of
Illinois Plumbing Code and/or associated Village Ordinances shall be grounds for refusal to
issue them further permits in the Village.

7. all other state and federal permits have been obtained.
B. The Chairman of the Coal Valley Planning & Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant
in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of Section
7 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
1. Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty-five dollars
($25) per one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage;
2. increase the risk to life and property, and
3. require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the
applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and liability.
C. Variances to the building protection requirements of Section 7 of this ordinance which are
requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic
structure as defined in “Historic Structures”, may be granted using criteria more permissive
than the requirements of Sections 6 and 7 of this ordinance subject to the conditions that:
1. The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
2. The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a
certified historic structure.
Section 12. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that
development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or
damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of the Village of
Coal Valley or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
Section 13. PENALTY.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the
conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this
ordinance. Upon due investigation, the Public Works Inspector / Building
Inspector may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
ordinance exists. The Public Works Inspector / Building Inspector shall notify the
owner in writing of such violation.
A. If such owner fails after ten (10) day notice to correct the violation:

requiring conformance with this ordinance or make such other order as the court
deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance.
Any person who violates this ordinance shall upon conviction thereof be fined in accordance
with Title I Division V Chapter 1 Section 3 of the Code of Ordinance for the
Village of Coal Valley for each offense.
2. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues, and the Village of Coal Valley shall record a notice of
violation on the title of the property.
B. The Building Inspector shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act
to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance
Policy to be suspended.
The Building Inspector is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject
development.
The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order.

permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the
Coal Valley Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be
served on the permittee and shall state:
1. The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation, and
2. The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Coal Valley Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine
whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
C. Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of Coal Valley from taking such other lawful action to
prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to th e person or
persons responsible.

otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement or unless
prohibited by preemptive law, each permittee shall pay an annual fee of one
dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per lineal foot of the facilities located in the public
right-of-way, up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per year. Any
discrepancy in lineal footage actually installed shall be reconciled by the parties
upon submission of as built drawings at the conclusion of the project. Such fees
shall serve as reimbursement for the Village’s costs in connection with reviewing,
inspecting, and supervising the use and occupancy of the public right-of-way on
behalf of the public and existing or future users.
Section 5. ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
a. Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications, containing
all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of Public Works or
his designee within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Director of Public Works or his designee shall reject such
application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works
or his designee is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this Chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the Director of Public Works or his designee shall issue a permit therefor as soon
as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works or his designee,
that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance
with the requirements of this Chapter.
b. Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications Retailers.
1. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this Article for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days
prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring
excavation. The Director of Public Works or his designee shall specify
the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed,
used and constructed.
2. In the event that the Director of Public Works or his designee fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either
i. ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving
excavation for new construction or
ii. twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving
excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer
may commence work without obtaining a permit under this
Chapter.
3. Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is
required for work pursuant to Section 4 of this Chapter the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an application for
a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation
available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall
be subject to the requirements of Subsection (a) of this Section.
c. Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State Authorization Under
the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a
holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable and Video Competition
Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days after submission to the
City Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the City Village, provided the holder
has complied with applicable City Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
Section 6. EFFECT OF PERMIT.
a. Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from
the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in
accordance with this Chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does not create a
property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of
others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
b. Duration. No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid for a period longer
than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
c. Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a
permit issued under this Chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all
major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit
at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a
date, time and place designated by the Village with such Village representatives
in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the
purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special
considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without
limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by
the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property
owners.
d. Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the Village
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
Section 7. REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from
the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit
application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village
within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or
plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the
locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the
requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance
with Section 21 of this Chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
Section 8. INSURANCE.
a. Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or
similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the
right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring
the utility as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed
officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs 1 and 2 below:
1. Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations,
explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as “X,”
“C,” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
i. One million dollars ($1,000,000) for bodily injury or death to each
erson;
ii. One million dollars ($1,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
iii. One million dollars ($1,000,000) for all other types of liability;
iv. Two million dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate;
2. Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
3. Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
4. Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than one million
dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this
Section.
b. Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section may be in
any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
c. Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required
by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written
request therefor from the Village.
d. Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention
not to renew be stated until ten (10) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or
certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village
Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than
ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village
evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.
e. Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirements required by Subsection (a) of this Section. A utility that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Subsection (a), or
the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section. A utility that
elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required under Subsection (a) of this Section, such as evidence
that the utility is a “private self insurer” under the Workers Compensation Act.
f. Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s Liability. The legal liability of
the utility to the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject
of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this Section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
g. Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be
effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to
conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. [All insurance carriers
and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or
higher by A.M. Best Company.]
Section 9. INDEMNIFICATION.
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree
to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-ofway,
and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions
are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising
out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Chapter by the Village,
its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
Section 10. SECURITY.
a. Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an
amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this
Chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or
expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this Chapter to perform that the Village must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee’s failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due
the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Chapter or any other
applicable law.
b. Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at
the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the
Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village.
Said forms are attached to this Chapter as Appendices 1 and 2. Any surety bond
or letter of credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and
the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the
Village of any amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of
Illinois at which it can be drawn.
c. Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for
the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a
condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as
determined by the Director of Public Works or his designee, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to
be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in
multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works or his
designee may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a
single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required
under the provisions of this Subsection (c) for any single phase.
d. Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen
(14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.
e. Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the
Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in Subsection
c) of this Section.
f. Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the
amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon
written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance
required in Subsection (c) of this Section.
g. Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized
under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security
Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time
after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for
failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Chapter or other
applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund,
and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village
to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred
by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess
of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
h. Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security
Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this
Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of
right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village
may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a
double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed
or otherwise violated.
Section 11. PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
a. Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a permit
issued pursuant to this Article for one or more of the following reasons:
1. Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete statements
in the permit application;
2. Non-compliance with this Chapter;
3. Permittee’s physical presence or presence of permittee’s facilities on,
over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare; or
4. Permittee’s failure to construct the facilities substantially in accordance
with the permit and approved plans.
b. Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The Village shall send written notice of its
intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Article stating the
reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the alternatives available
to permittee under this Section 11.
c. Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or Suspension.
Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from the Village, the
permittee shall have the following options:
1. Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists for
the revocation or suspension;
2. Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the deficiencies
stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such correction to
the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the written notice
of revocation; or
3. Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way to
the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods provided
in this Subsection.
d. Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation or
suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within Subsection (a) of this Section.
e. Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails to comply
with the provisions of Subsection (c) of this Section, the Village or its designee
may, at the option of the Village: (1) correct the deficiencies; (2) upon not less
than twenty (20) days notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or
equipment; or (3) after not less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of
failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
Village. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of
removal.
Section 12. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
a. Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less than thirty (30)
days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way or change
in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the facility shall have all
the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former owner under the permit, if
any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this
Chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in the right-of-way.
b. Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village’s right-of-way.
c. Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must be
changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
Section 13. GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
a. Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall be consistent
with applicable ordinances (including, but not limited to, the Village of Coal Valley
supplemental specifications), codes, laws rules and regulations, and commonly
recognized and accepted traffic control and construction principles, sound
engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles and standards set
forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from time to time:

b. Interpretation of Municipal Standards and Principles. If a discrepancy exists
between or among differing principles and standards required by this Chapter,
the Director of Public Works or his designee shall determine, in the exercise of
sound engineering judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be
final. If requested, the Director of Public Works or his designee shall state which
standard or principle will apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a
facility in the future.
Section 14. TRAFFIC CONTROL.
a. Minimum Requirements. The Village’s minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT’s Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices and this Code.
b. Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers. The utility is responsible for
providing and installing warning signs, protective devices and flaggers, when
necessary, meeting applicable federal, state, and local requirements for
protection of the public and the utility’s workers when performing any work on the

the general location requirements of this subsection.
1. No Interference with Village Facilities. No utility facilities shall be placed in any
location if the Village Engineering determines that the proposed location will
require the relocation or displacement of any of the Village’s utility facilities or
will otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the
Village’s utility facilities.
2. Minimum Interference and Impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way
and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners who adjoin said right-of-way. Facilities shall be placed
underground whenever feasible.
3. No Interference with Travel. No utility facility shall be placed in any
location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
4. No Limitations on Visibility. No utility facility shall be placed in any
location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
5. Size of Utility Facilities. The proposed installation shall use the smallest
suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
6. Screening. Screening shall be required for all units equal to or greater
than four feet in height as measured from existing grade, with the
exception of street light and traffic signal controller cabinets.
i. Where screening is required, it shall be provided in accordance
with Zoning Ordinance, Article IV – General Provisions, Section 10,
Landscaping.
ii. Equipment shall be located so that its visual impact is minimized.
Equipment shall not be permitted to be located within the parkway
area between the public sidewalk and street curb, unless another
feasible location is not available within or outside of the right-ofway.
The equipment shall be positioned to maximize the
effectiveness of the screening, including locating the equipment so
that the access panel is located on the side that is least visible;
however, boxes shall not be placed to impede views for
pedestrians, cyclists, or drivers. Screening requirements may be
waived by the Director of Public Works or his designee where
installation of screening may have negative impacts on the public
safety, such as impeding views for pedestrians, cyclists, and
drivers on the adjacent roadways, sidewalks, bike paths, and
driveways, or if such installation would be unduly burdensome. All
screening must be maintained by the permittee.
b. Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways.
1. Overhead Parallel Facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be located
within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
i. Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line and
as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
ii. Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the
face of the curb, where available;
iii. Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m)
outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the
clear zone;
iv. No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
v. Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
2. Underground Parallel Facilities. An underground parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
i. The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as practicable
and not more than eight (8) feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the .
ii. A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a highway
only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in
existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and
iii. In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable
and not more than five (5) feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line
and any above-grounded appurtenance shall be located within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
c. Facilities Crossing Highways.
1. No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing facilities
installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as
encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to
the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
2. Cattle Passes, Culverts, or Drainage Facilities. Crossing facilities shall
not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
3. 90 Degree Crossing Required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or as
near to a ninety (90) degree angle to the centerline as practicable.

the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
ii. Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
5. Underground Power or Communication Facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
i. The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
ii. Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
6. Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at each
right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the
type of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers
may also be eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations. (49
C.F.R. §192.707 (1989).
d. Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The Village may require
that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not highways,
rather than within particular highways.
e. Freestanding Facilities.
1. The Village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding facility
located within a right-of-way.
2. The Village may require any freestanding facility located within a right-ofway
to be screened from view.
f. Facilities Installed Above Ground. Above ground facilities may be installed only
if:
1. No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
2. New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
3. The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will employ
suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors
and cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used
wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
g. Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
1. Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall
include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent
poles, cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely
separated from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting
commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized,
especially those under significant pressure or potential, present high
degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted.
2. A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility installation
on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
i. The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and
property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
ii. The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
iii. The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
iv. The proposed method of attachment;
v. The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;

locations in order to preserve visual quality.
2. A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require
extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners,
and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being
traversed.
Section 16. CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
a. Standards and Requirements for Particular Types of Construction Methods.
1. Boring or Jacking.
i. Pits and Shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified
by the Director of Public Works or his designee from the edge of
the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall be excavated no
more than 48 hours in advance of boring or jacking operations
and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking operations
are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked
and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed,

one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time
unless special permission is obtained from the Director of Public
Works or his designee.
ii. Open Trench and Excavated Material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of
the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where
practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between the
roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material
shall not be allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway.
Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing excavated
material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
iii. Drip Line of Trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip line of
any tree designated by the Village to be preserved.
3. Backfilling.
i. Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length
using methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s
“Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.”
When excavated material is hauled away or is unsuitable for
backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
ii. For a period of three years from the date construction of a facility
is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and
restore any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of
the facility. If so ordered by the Director of Public Works or his
designee, the utility, at its expense, shall remove any pavement
and backfill material to the top of the installed facility, place and
properly compact new backfill material, and restore new
pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades,
as determined by the Director of Public Works or his designee.
4. Pavement Cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair shall be
permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed to
traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this paragraph 4 is
permitted under Section 21, the following requirements shall apply:
i. Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and
compacted as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6
or CA-10 gradation, as designated by the Director of Public
Works or his designee.
ii. Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall
be provided immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the
temporary repair or the restoration shall be rebuilt upon
notification by the Village.
iii. All saw cuts shall be full depth.
iv. For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced
in the last three (3) years, permits shall not be issued unless
such work is determined to be an emergency repair or other
work considered necessary and unforeseen before the time of
the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
v. For PCC pavement restoration, pavement shall be replaced in
full panels.

continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by welding or
jointed installation approved by the Village.
ii. The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes
shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that
particular section of the highway.
iii. In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village
approved jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may
be omitted only if pipe is installed prior to highway construction
and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical joints are of a type
approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
iv. In the case of gas pipelines, of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
v. In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be
eliminated only if:
(1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance
or repair and
(2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
vi. If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that
construction does not disrupt the right-of-way.

practicable method of vegetation control.
Section 18. REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
a. Notice. Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the Village, a utility
shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities
within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that
such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or
upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
b. Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following written
notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its
own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the
rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
1. Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or franchise,
unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
2. If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a
license or franchise, if required;
3. If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a
required permit in violation of this Article; or
4. If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by
the permittee’s license or franchise.
c. Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the right and
privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the
Village, as the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in
response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the
municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing
a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.
d. Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-ofway
of the Village, the utility shall notify the Village within ninety (90) days.
Following receipt of such notice the Village may direct the utility to remove all or
any portion of the facility if the Director of Public Works or his designee
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the Village does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
Section 19. CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other
property within ten (10) days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged
or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the
Village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the Director of Public
Works or his designee. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling,
regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a

a. General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rightsof-
way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the
Village and at the utility’s expense.
b. Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify non-compliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
1. If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-ofway,
the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as
to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other
means of access to the facility is available.
2. In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Director
of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of
the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the
free movement of traffic, the Village Police shall be notified immediately.
3. In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
c. Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the Village a description
of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency
repair.
Section 21. VARIANCES.
a. Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the
provisions of this Chapter must do so in writing, and accompanied by the
appropriate variance request fee, to the Village’s Planning and Zoning
Commission through the Director of Public Works or his designee as a part of the
permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this Chapter from
which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be
granted.
b. Authority to Grant Variances. The Village’s Planning and Zoning Commission
shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this Chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
c. Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Village’s Planning and Zoning
Commission may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance
has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain
features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that
would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would
conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
d. Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for authorizing a
variance, the Village’s Planning and Zoning Commission may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this Chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this Chapter.
e. Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Village Administrative
Hearing Officer under the provisions of this Chapter shall have the right to appeal
in circuit court pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Law.
Section 22. PENALTIES.
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of this Chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions
of this Code. There may be times when the Village will incur delay or other costs, including
third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit
and this Chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking
the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the Village’s costs of damages and
its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or

Section 1. Chapter 6, SUBDIVISON AND OFFICIAL MAP, of TITLE IV
Of the Code of Ordinances of the Village of Coal Valley, Illinois is hereby amended to read
as follows:
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1. PURPOSE.
In accordance with State law (65 ILCS 5/11-12-8--5/11-12-12) this Ordinance regulates the
subdivision and development of land in order to implement the Village of Coal Valley
Comprehensive Plan and Official Map. Thus, this Ordinance assists in achieving the
following specific objectives:
1.1. to preserve, protect, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare;
1.2 to provide a pleasant living environment by furthering the orderly layout
and use of land; and to create an environment conducive to the
productive development of the Village;
1.3. to avoid legal and other problems by requiring that subdivided land be
properly monumented and recorded;
1.4. to conserve and increase the value of land, improvements, and buildings;
1.5 to preserve the natural beauty and topography to the maximum feasible
extent;
1.6 to provide adequate light, air, and privacy for all residents of new
developments by preventing undue concentration of population;
1.7 to protect against injury or damage caused by fire, pollution, flooding,
storm water runoff, or erosion and sedimentation;
1.8 to provide safe and convenient access to new developments and to avoid
traffic congestion by requiring the proper location, design, and
construction of streets and sidewalks;
1.9 to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining adequate water mains,
sanitary sewers, storm water sewers, and other utilities and services; and
1.10 to ensure that adequate parks, schools, and similar facilities can be
made available to serve the residents of new developments.
1.11 provide for the acceptance of lands for public rights-ofway.
Section 2. JURISDICTION.
This Ordinance shall be applicable within the corporate limits of the Village of Coal Valley
and within all unincorporated territory located within one and one-half (1.5) miles of said
limits, provided such territory is not located within the subdivision jurisdiction for another
municipality. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-12-9 for State requirements concerning jurisdictional
boundary lines.)
Section 3. INTERPRETATION.
8
Every provision of this Ordinance shall be construed liberally to achieve the purposes
outlined in Section 1.1.
3.1 MORE RESTRICTIVE REQUIREMENTS APPLY: Whenever the
requirements of this ordinance differ from those of any statute, lawfully
adopted ordinance or regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction,
the more stringent requirement shall prevail. Thus, in accordance with
State law (65 ILCS 5/11-12-11), whenever this Ordinance imposes
higher standards than the county subdivision ordinance, said higher
standards shall supersede the county regulations in the unincorporated
territory located within the Village of Coal Valley's subdivision jurisdiction.
3.2 This Ordinance is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant,
deed restriction, or any other private agreement or restriction; provided,
that, where the provisions of this Ordinance are more restrictive or
impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant,
deed restriction, or other private agreement or restriction, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall govern. Where the provisions of the
easement, covenant, deed restriction, or private agreement or restriction
impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than
the requirements of this ordinance or the determinations of the Village in
approving a subdivision or in enforcing this ordinance, and such private
provisions are not inconsistent with this ordinance or determinations there
under, then such private provisions shall be operative and supplemental
to this ordinance and determinations made there under. The Village
does not purport to enforce any such private provisions not reflected on
the plat and its supporting documents and unless there is expressed in
the nature of the document and the approval process an intent to give the
Village enforcement rights over same.
Section 4. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
4.1 Except as may be provided otherwise by statute or ordinance, no officer,
board member, commission member, agent, or employee of the Village
of Coal Valley shall render himself personally liable for any damage that
may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or
permitted in the discharge of his duties under this ordinance. (See "Local
Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act," (745
ILCS 10/1-101.)
4.2 Any suit brought against any officer, board member, commission
member, agent, or employee of the Village of Coal Valley, as a result of
any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under this
ordinance, shall be defended by the Village Attorney and/or insurance
carrier until the final determination of the legal proceedings.
Section 5. VARIANCES.
When the subdivider can show that a provision of this Ordinance, if strictly adhered to,
would cause the unnecessary hardship and when, in the opinion of the Plan Commission,
because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made
without destroying the intent of such provision, the Plan Commission may recommend a
variance or modification to the Board of Trustees. The subdivider shall apply in writing for
such variance or modification of the action. Any variance or modification thus authorized
shall be attached to and made a part of the final plat.

connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to twenty-five (25) times the
algebraic difference in percent of grade. In no case shall the vertical curve be less than one
hundred (100) feet in length. For other types of streets, or unique conditions to the site, the
Village Engineer shall establish the minimum length of vertical curve to be used.
Section 12.2. THROUGH TRAFFIC DISCOURAGED
Marginal access and local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by through
traffic. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern should be avoided, and the use of
curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more
desirable street layout.
Section 12.3. LIMITED ACCESS TO ARTERIALS
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning
Commission may recommend to the Board of Trustees that access to said arterial may be
limited by one of the following means:
a. The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial street and front
onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in an access restricted strip along the rear lot
lines of such lots;
b. A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from
and generally at right angles to the arterial street; or
c. A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting strip, but
having access thereto at suitable points.
Section 12.5. DEAD END STREETS
a. Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for the
continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective
fire and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where
such continuation comports with the Comprehensive Plan. If the
adjacent property is owned by the Subdivider (under the same
ownership) and undeveloped and the street must dead-end temporarily,
the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line, and no strip that
would prevent connections with future streets shall be reserved. A
temporary turnaround shall be provided at the terminus of any temporary
dead-end street. If the adjacent property is under another ownership
there should be a permanent turnaround.
17
b. Permanent Dead End Streets: Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length
of 750 feet. A cul-de-sac turn-around, having a minimum right-of-way
diameter of ninety-eight (98) feet, a minimum pavement return radius of
twenty-five (25) feet, and a pavement diameter of seventy-five (75) feet,
shall be provided at the end of every permanent dead-end street.
Section 12.6. ALLEYS
Alleys shall be prohibited in single-family residence districts. Alleys may be required in
multiple-family districts and in commercial/industrial districts unless other adequate
provisions for service access are made. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be
provided at the terminus of any dead-end alley.
Section 12.7. INTERSECTIONS
a. Only Two Streets: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any
one point.
b. Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles; in no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less that eighty (80) degrees or more than one hundred (100)
degrees. An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection
and shall be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at
least one hundred (100) feet there from.
c. Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections
on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line
offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall not be
permitted, except where the intersected street has divided lanes without
median breaks at either intersection. Intersections involving collector or
arterial streets shall be at least eight hundred (800) feet apart.
d. Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the minimum
curb radius at the intersection of two streets shall be fifteen (15) feet
where both streets are marginal access or local and at other
intersections, not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
e. Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade of 0.5%.
In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a two percent (2%) slope
for a distance of sixty (60) feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
f. Cross-Slope: The cross slopes of all streets, including intersections,
shall not exceed three percent (3%).
g. Adequate Sight Lines: Where any street intersection will involve earth
banks or existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and/or
vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public
right-of-way to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance in
accordance with the following chart:

APPENDIX 1 ARTICLE I STORM WATER ORDINANCE
Authority and Purpose; Other Relevant Permitting; Applicability; Exemptions; Exceptions;
and Separability:
Section 34. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the Village of Coal
Valley, Illinois, by the Illinois Compiled Statutes, 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11/30-2,
and 5/11/31-2.
43
The purpose of this ordinance is to diminish threats to public health and safety, protect
property, prevent damage to the environment and promote public welfare by guiding,
regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any new
development or redevelopment or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
otherwise results in the movement of earth and/or changes the stormwater drainage pattern
and/or stormwater flows from that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its
natural state. This stormwater runoff and resulting soil erosion could result in the inundation
of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the
pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. One cause of increases in stormwater
runoff quantity or rate and impairment of quality, and loss of valuable topsoil is the new
development or redevelopment of the land. This ordinance regulates these activities to
minimize adverse impacts.
This ordinance is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
a. To assure that new development or redevelopment does not increase the
drainage or flood hazards, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
soil erosion;
b. To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood
damage due to increased stormwater runoff and soil erosion;
c. To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding
and soil erosion on a watershed basis;
d. To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to
flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion
problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by stormwater
runoff and soil erosion quantities from new development or
redevelopment;
e. To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
soil, water, air, animal, and plant resources;
e. To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses, wetlands and flood plains for protecting water quality, and
enhance stormwater management and aquatic habitats;
f. To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to
manage floodand storm water impacts, improve water and groundwater
quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, maintain
quality forest resources, provide recreational opportunities, provide
aesthetic benefits, enhance community and economic development.
Section 35. OTHER RELEVANT PERMITTING:
Before a Development Permit under this ordinance becomes effective, all required Federal,
State, and Local permits will have been received for the site subject to new development or
redevelopment. The acquisition of these permits shall be the sole responsibility of the
applicant. These may include but are not limited to Section 404 of the Clean Waters Act;

Section 43. WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES:
The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse surface and groundwater
quality impacts off-site and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design
features to capture storm water runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give
preference to wet bottom and wetland type designs and all flows from the development
shall be routed through the basin (i.e. low flows shall not be bypassed). Detention of storm
water shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of
storm water runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered
compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat,
recreation (boating, fishing, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation.
Section 44. DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS, AND METHODS:
44.1 Release Rates: The drainage system for new developments or redevelopments
shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2
year, 24 hour and 100 year, 24 hour events to pre project levels which will not
cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered
in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage
capacities. The peak discharge rate from events less than or equal to the 2 year,
24 hour event and the peak discharge rate for the 100-year, 24 hour event shall
be determined by the Village Engineer.
44.2 Detention Basin Outlet Design: Backwater on the outlet structure from the
downstream drainage system shall be addressed when designing the outlet.
44.3 Detention Storage Requirements: The design maximum storage to be provided in
the detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the runoff difference before
and after development from the 100 year, 24 hour event. All detention basin
storage shall be computed using Hydrograph Methods utilizing reservoir routing
(also called modified pulse or level pool) or equivalent method as described in
Section 44.7.
44.4 Drainage System Design and Evaluation: The following criteria should be used in
evaluating and designing the drainage system. The design will provide capacity
to pass the 10 year, 24 hour peak flow in the minor drainage system and an
overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. Whenever
practicable, the storm water systems shall not result in the interbasin transfer of
drainage unless no other alternative exists.
44.5 Design Methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to 10
acres, may be designed using the Rational Formula. The Rational Formula may
also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites up to 100 acres.
Runoff hydrograph methods as described in Section 44.7 must be used for major
54
drainage system design for all systems with greater than 10 acres of drainage
area and for the design of all detention basins.
44.6 Positive Drainage: Whenever practicable, all developments must be provided an
overland flow path that will pass the 100 year, 24 hour flow at a stage at least one
(1) foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the flow path.
Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage
system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow
depths shall not exceed curb heights.
44.7 Methods for generating runoff hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and
antecedent moisture.
44.8 Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology
is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water
Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for
the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or
equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the
design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical
durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile
distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations
greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described
by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin 70. Refer to Table 13 of Bulletin 70
for rainfall depth, duration, and frequency. The NRCS Type II distribution may be
used as an alternate to the Huff distributions.
44.9 Antecedent Moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs, which do not rely on a
continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions, shall use wet
antecedent moisture condition as a minimum.
44.10 Agriculture Tiles and Sanitary Sewers: Connections to sanitary sewers or existing
agricultural storm water management system (tiles) shall not be permitted for new
developments. However, in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of
the Village Engineer, connections to existing agricultural storm water
management systems may be allowed if the applicant demonstrates that the
existing system, has adequate hydraulic capacity, and structural integrity.
Additionally, development meeting the criteria in Section 44 shall either obtain a
maintenance agreement or deed or plat restriction covering the entire
downstream drain tile in accordance to be determined of this ordinance before a
connection to that system is permitted. Field tile systems disturbed during the
process of land development must be reconnected by those responsible for their
disturbance unless the approved drainage plan incorporates the tiles in the land
development design.
44.11 Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove
storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as
feasible to be available for recreational use.
44.12 Wet Basin Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep, excluding nearshore
banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at
least ten (10) feet deep over twenty-five (25%) percent of the bottom area to
prevent winterkill.
44.13 Wet Basin Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool
elevation shall not be steeper than five to one (5 to 1 horizontal to vertical). It is
recommended that native aquatic vegetation be established around the perimeter
to provide protection from shoreline erosion.
44.14 Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal
depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2 year, 24-
hour event as a minimum.
55
44.15 Wet Basin Inlet and Outlet Orientation: The distance between detention inlets and
outlets shall be maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the
basin providing that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on
topography or other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use baffles
or berms in the basin bottom to prevent short-circuiting. There shall be no low
flow bypass between the inlet and outlet. Paved low flow channels shall not be
used. The minimum flow length shall be ten (10) feet with a recommended
minimum ratio of two to one (2:1) for width.
44.16 Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other requirements of this
ordinance, dry basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants, to be
safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for
multiple uses.
44.17 Dry Basin Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty percent (80%) of
their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than seventy-two (72) hours
for any runoff event less than the 100-year, 24 hour event. Grading plans shall
clearly distinguish the wet portion of the basin bottom. Under drains directed to
the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement.
44.18 Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry
basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize
resuspension of pollutants.
44.19 Dry Basin Inlet and Outlet Orientation: Shall be the same as Article III, Section
44.15.
44.20 Temporary Sediment Trap: A sediment trap shall be constructed at each major
inlet to a dry basin during construction. The temporary sediment trap should be
designed in accordance with criteria in the Illinois Urban Manual.
44.21 Existing Depressional Areas: Existing depressional storage volume will be
maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the
requirements of this ordinance shall be in addition to existing storage.
44.22 Minimum Detention Outlet Size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be
used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of twelve (12) inches.
If design release rates call for smaller outlets, a design that minimizes the
possibility of clogging shall be used. Minimum outlet restrictor size shall be 4"
provided there is adequate downstream capacity. Detention volumes for a
development shall be dictated by adherence to the release rates specified in
Section 44.1.
44.23 Detention in Flood Plains: The placement of detention basins within the flood
plain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation
during flood events. However, the storm water detention requirements of this
ordinance may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas
on the project site provided the following provisions are met as well as
compliance with Article I, Section 11.
44.24 Detention in Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin in a flood
fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the volume below
the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms.
The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled
consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate
its operation for all stream-flow and flood plain backwater conditions.
Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or
adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All flood plain storage lost below the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the existing ten-year
elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the existing ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory
56
storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse and comply with Article I, Section 11.
44.25 Detention on Prime Farmland: The placement of detention basins shall avoid the
utilization of prime farmland. All detention basin construction shall examine
potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address measures that
will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with Article I, Section
11.
44.26 Detention in Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in
accordance with Article III, Section 44.27.
44.27 On-Stream Detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable
if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this
ordinance with respect to water quality and control of the 2 year and 100 year, 24
hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in Article III, Section
34 of this ordinance. If on-stream detention is used in watersheds larger than
one square mile, the applicant will use hydrographic modeling to demonstrate that
the design will not increase the water level for any properties upstream or
downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of onstream
detention:
a. Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require
access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning;
b. Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream
aquatic habitat;
c. Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank
stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin;
d. Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands;
e. Shall require the implementation of an effective non-point source
management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall
include as a minimum: runoff reduction "Best Management Practices"
(BMP's) consistent with Article III, Section 42; 2 year, 24 hour detention /
sedimentation basins for all development consistent with Article III,
Section 44.20;
f. Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge;
g. Shall not contribute to the duration or flood frequency of any adjacent
h. land, and
i. Shall comply with Article I, Section 11.
44.28 Drainage Into Wetlands, Rivers, Streams, Lakes, Ponds, and Depressional
Storage Areas: Wetlands, lakes, ponds and depressional storage areas shall be
protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and
quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements
of this ordinance, the following requirements shall be met for all developments
whose drainage flows into wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage
areas:
44.29 Detention in Wetlands, Rivers, Streams, Lakes, Ponds or Depressional Storage
Areas: Existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas shall
not be modified for the purposes of storm water detention unless it is
demonstrated that the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat
and ability to perform beneficial functions and shall comply with Article I, Section
11. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, lakes,
57
ponds or depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume of
detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in
addition to this existing storage.
44.30 Sediment Control: The existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, or depressional
storage areas shall be protected during construction and as further regulated in
Article IV of this ordinance, and shall not be filled.
44.31 Alteration of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to
substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to wetlands, rivers,
lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas. Drainage patterns shall not be
altered by development to direct runoff offsite to other than natural drainage
outlets existing prior to development.
44.32 Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through
a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-
hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the
wetland, river, lake, pond, or depressional storage area. This basin shall be
constructed before property grading begins and shall be maintained throughout
the construction process. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in Article III,
Section 41 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being
discharged to the wetland, river, stream, lake, pond, or depressional storage area
and as further regulated in Article II and Article IV of this ordinance.
44.33 Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width, preferably
vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the
periphery of a wetland, river, stream, lake, pond or depressional storage area.
44.34 Loessal Soils: Care must be taken to avoid open flow discharges of storm water
over silt (Loessal) soils due to high potential for erosion.
44.35 Abandoned Mines: The following requirements apply for new developments or redevelopments
where abandoned mines are determined to be present:
a. A storm water detention basin shall not be placed in or over an
abandoned mine;
b. Storm water detention basins shall not be located closer than one
hundred (100) feet from the opening of an abandoned mine;
c. The outflow from a storm water detention basin, channel, ditch or any
storm water runoff generated as a result of a new development or
redevelopment shall not empty into or be directed, redirected by any
means into or through any abandoned mine;
d. If, after the review of the storm water drainage plan, the Village Engineer
may determine that more detailed information is required, a abandoned
mine evaluation may be required. A abandoned mine evaluation which
addresses the geologic, engineering and environmental factors resulting
from a new development or redevelopment be performed by a
professional with experience and expertise in abandoned mine
topography, whom shall certify the results of the evaluation. This
evaluation shall be the responsibility of the applicant and performed at no
cost to the Village. After a review of this evaluation and with the
consultation of the Rock Island or Henry Soil and Water Conservation
District, the Village Engineer may either approve or disapprove the
drainage plan as submitted;
e. Whenever an abandoned mine is discovered or it becomes apparent that
the abandoned mine has not yet been identified, it shall be reported to the
Rock Island or Henry Soil and Water Conservation District; and
58
f. Shall comply with Article I, Section 11.
44.36 Street Detention: Parking Lot Detention, and Culvert Drainage:
44.37 Street Detention: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage
system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights and shall not remain
flooded for more than eight (8) hours for any event less than or equal to the 100
year, 24 hour event.

area shall not exceed six (6) inches for more than four (4) hours.
44.39 Culvert, Road and Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider
entrance and exit losses as well as tail water conditions on the culvert.
44.40 Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices
including basins, trenches, and porous pavement and shall follow criteria in the
Illinois Urban Manual with Article I, Section 11. An appropriate sediment control
device shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from storm water flows
before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Storm water shall not be allowed
to stand more than seventy-two hours over eighty percent of the dry basin's
bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of
infiltration basins or trenches shall be a minimum of three feet above the
seasonally high groundwater and bedrock level. Engineering calculations
demonstrating infiltration rates shall be included with the application.
44.41 Vegetated Filter Strips and Swales: To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and
promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of
vegetated filter strips and swales, shall be designed to follow criteria in the Illinois
Urban Manual. Whenever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be
directed onto filter trips and swales comprised of native grasses and forbs before
being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin.
44.42 Safety Considerations: The drainage system components, especially all detention
basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in
contact with the system during runoff events and shall comply with Article I,
Section 11.
44.43 Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100 year, 24 hour capacity
shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for
stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open
channels shall not be steeper than three (3) to one (1) (horizontal to vertical).
44.44 Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four
feet in width 2.5 to 3 feet below the normal water depth.
44.45 Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to
safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.
44.46 Overflow Structures: All storm water detention basins shall be provided with an
overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one
foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin. The
design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100 year, 24-
hour inflow rate.
44.47 Maintenance Considerations: The storm water drainage system shall be designed
to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be designed to
allow lawn-mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be
provided with alternate outflows, which can be used to completely drain the pool
for sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not
feasible. Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for heavy equipment
59
shall be provided. Use of native vegetation is strongly encouraged to reduce
maintenance, increase wildlife habitat, and to provide other benefits.
44.48 A maintenance plan for the ongoing maintenance of all stormwater management
system components including wetlands is required prior to plan approval. The
plan shall include:
a. Maintenance tasks;
b. The party responsible for performing the maintenance tasks;
c. A description of all permanent public or private access maintenance
easements and overland flow paths, and compensatory storage areas;
and
d. A description of dedicated sources of funding for the required
maintenance.
Section 45. ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS:
Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of
the property's drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from upstream areas that are
not to be detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being
developed.
45.1 Upstream Areas Not meeting Ordinance Requirements: When there are areas
not meeting the storage and release rates of this ordinance, tributary to the
applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be
explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed:
a. The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property
using the release rates of Article III, Section 44, the applicant's property
area, and the procedures described in Article III, Section 43;
b. Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and
release rate requirements of this ordinance, shall be identified; and
c. Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property area,
total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed.
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage
shall be computed as described in Article III, Section 44. If tributary areas are not
developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be used
for the purposes of computing storage.
Once the necessary combined storage is computed the Village may choose to pay for oversizing
the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's
responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed above. If regional
storage is selected by the Village then the design produced in Article III, Section 43 shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the Village the applicant shall bypass all
tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable. If the applicant
must route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one-square
mile in size, the applicant must meet the provision of Section 44.27 for on-stream basins.
45.2 Upstream Areas Meeting Ordinance Requirements: When there are areas which
meet the storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance, tributary to the
applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the applicant's
detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the
applicant's property shall be computed as described in Article III, Section 45.2.
However, if the Village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's
basin, the final design storm water releases shall be based on the combined total
of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time
60
will the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed the allowable release rate
for his/her property alone.
Section 45. EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES:
Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the
drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial
earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by
the applicant on a regular basis and before project completion in order to maintain the
design volume of the facilities.
Section 45. FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION:
All new development or redevelopment not exceeding fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet
of impervious surface may pay a fee of $10,000 for each acre-foot of detention which would
be required under this ordinance rather than installing detention facilities on the property,
unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the Zoning Officer. The Village, also shall
have the option of requiring a fee of $10,000 for each acre-foot of detention needed in lieu
of the applicant building a basin on-site provided a new development or re-development
project exceeds fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet of impervious surface, provided the
property will discharge storm water to the Village storm drainage system, if applicable.
In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale can be achieved, it will be
permissible for adjacent properties to utilize a common regional detention basin.
Applicants shall have the option of paying a fee of $10,000 for each acre-foot of detention
required so that the Village can build regional facilities or the applicants can jointly build the
necessary facilities themselves.
APPENDIX IV ARTICLE V - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
Section 46. FINDINGS:
The Village hereby finds that:
a. The soil types found in the Village Illinois are susceptible to erosion and if
left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to
property;
b. The topography of the Village contains areas with steep slopes upon
which, if clearing of trees and/or inappropriate construction takes place,
could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems, which could
result in damage to property;
c. Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non-agricultural uses including but not limited to
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial
plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream
channels and drainage ways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
d. The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by
decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles;
e. Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed out fills,
and embankments;
f. Sediment from soil erosion clogs drainage systems and pollutes rivers,
streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
g. Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys
61
fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove;
and
h. Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of flood plains and natural depressions, resulting in increased
chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
Section 47. GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
It is the objective of this ordinance to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by
development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land,
in the Village. Measures taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment runoff shall be
adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of tenyear,
24 hour frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all new development
or redevelopment activities within the Village and to the preparation of the submissions
required under Article IV, Section 48 of this ordinance:
a. New development or redevelopment shall be related to the topography
and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas
of steep slopes greater than seven percent (7%) where high cuts and fills
maybe required are to be avoided wherever possible, and natural
contours should be followed as closely as possible,
b. Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and
wetlands are to be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary
crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate
stabilization measures,
c. Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream,
lake, pond, abandoned wetland or mine. Preventive measures shall
reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation,
d. The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest

49.1 Erosion and Sediment Control Design Requirements: New developments or
redevelopments shall comply with Article IV, Section 48 and meet the following:
49.2 Control measures shall be constructed to control runoff from the property to such
an extent possible that sediment is retained on-site.
49.3 Temporary on-site control measures required shall be constructed and functional
prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
49.4 Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with permanent measures within seven (7)
calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or redisturbance consistent
with the following criteria:
a. Appropriate permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding,
mulching, sodding, with non-vegetative measures as a last resort; and
b. Areas having slopes greater than 12% shall be stabilized with sod, mat,
or blanket in combination with seeding or equivalent.
49.5 All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be
maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their
intended function.
49.6 All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed in a
proper manner within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved with
permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently
stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
49.7 In the event the developer of a subdivision constructs a temporary detention
basin, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to maintain the detention basin
during development of the subdivision, and upon the completion of the
development of the subdivision, to remove the detention basin and all material
used in its construction. Completion of development of the subdivision as it
relates to this Ordinance shall mean the stabilization of all sites within the
subdivision has been achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures and
approved by a Village representative or the Village Engineer. As a part of the
developer’s soil erosion and sediment control plan, the developer shall provide
the following:
65
a. The reservation of an access easement by the developer to assure
access to the detention basin, in order for the developer to close and
remove the detention basin and all material used in its construction, and
to properly seed the area, all at the direction of the Village Engineer, after
completion of development of the subdivision, or
b. A provision in the developer’s soil erosion and sediment control plan,
whereby the developer sets forth a plan by which the developer assures
the Village that the developer will otherwise, upon completion of the
development of the subdivision, remove the temporary detention basin
and all material used in its construction and properly see the area, at the
direction of the Village engineer.
c. The developer shall be fully obligated under the subdivision performance
bond, as filed with the Village pursuant to Section 17, to comply with all
provisions of this section.
49.8 Site Development Requirements: On-site sediment control measures, as
specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed as specified in the
referenced handbooks, and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
a. For new developments or redevelopments less than one (1) acre, filter
barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control
measures) shall be constructed to control all on-site runoff. Vegetated
filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet, may be used as
an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected;
b. For new developments or re-developments more than one (1) acre but
less than five (5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure
shall be constructed at the down slope point of the disturbed area,
c. For new developments or re-developments greater than five (5) acres, a
sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the
down slope point of the disturbed area;
d. Sediment basin and sediment trap designs shall provide for both "dry"
detention and "wet" detention sediment storage. The detention storage
shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and “dry”
detention storage and each shall be sized as regulated in Article III,
Section 44. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate as regulated in
Article III. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it
only drains the dry detention storage;
e. The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load
generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a
minimum storage equivalent to the volume or sediment generated in one
year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the 1-year sediment
load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted; and
f. To the extent possible or as otherwise regulated in this ordinance all
desirable trees eight (8) inches in diameter and larger shall be protected
for their present and future value for erosion protection and other
environmental benefits. Trees that have been selected for preservation
shall be marked prior to the beginning of any clearing, grading, stripping,
excavation, or filling of the site. A "No" construction zone shall be
established and marked at the perimeter of the drip line of each tree,
which is to be preserved.
49.9 Storm water conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and
the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed as
regulated in Article III. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
66
within 48 hours, consistent with the following standards and as required in the
referenced handbooks:
a. For grades up to 4 percent, seeding in combination with mulch, erosion
blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or
erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel;
b. For grades of 4 to 8 percent, sod or an equivalent control measure shall
be applied in the channel; and
c. For grades greater than 8 percent, rock, riprap, or an equivalent control
measure shall be applied over filter fabric or other type of soil protection,
or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures.
49.10 Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible,
or as regulated in Article III. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the
following requirements shall be met.
a. Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the
maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are
necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive
material, such as riprap or gravel;
b. The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a
minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
stabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted, or stopped; and
c. Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be
constructed under dry conditions and fully stabilized before flow is
diverted, incorporating meanders, pool and riffle sequence, and riparian
planting.
49.11 Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter
barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications.
49.12 Soil storage piles containing more than 10 cubic yards of material shall not be
located with a downslope drainage length of less than 50 feet to a roadway,
drainage channel, or abandoned mine. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter
fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately surrounding the perimeter of
the pile.
49.13 If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from
erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed
sediment traps or basins, or equivalent and shall not be deposited into an
abandoned mine.
49.14 Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and
parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being
tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or
private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before
the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area.
Section 50. MAINTENANCE OF CONTROL MEASURES:
All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this
ordinance shall be maintained by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period
of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure
adequate performance. The applicant or contractor responsible for maintaining the soil
erosion and sediment control practices shall inspect all such practices at least once every 7
days or within 24 hours of a precipitation event equal to or exceeding 0.5" of rainfall.

sediment controls.
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the
permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above
work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the
results given within five (5) working days after notice is received by the Village from the
permittee, the permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without presuming
acceptance by the Village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in
68
writing at the site. A duplicate copy shall be kept by the enforcing agency of the Village
and/or the Rock Island County SWCD.
Section 53. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:
If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Rock Island County SWCD
determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by
an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or
drainage structure, the Village shall require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done,
that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to avoid
the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a
more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing,
compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and
recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be
made requirements for further work.
53.1 Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any
development site is not complete, work shall be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments
or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Zoning Officer shall specify the time
of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
Section 54. AMENDMENT OF PLANS:

Section 8. ADULT REGULATED USES:
A. Regulated Uses: The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois has judicially confirmed that the purpose of these amendments as hereinafter stated serves a valid governmental interest. In the development and execution of this Ordinance, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas, particularly adjacent and nearby residential and commercial areas where nurseries, schools, nursing homes, and churches and similar uses are located, Proper and realistic zoning and special regulations of these uses are necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood, or discouraging normal development of undeveloped areas. These special regulations are itemized in this Section. To prevent such uses from having an adverse effect upon the adjacent and nearby residential and commercial areas above referred to, such uses are hereby established as
57
permitted uses in the industrially zoned area of I-1 Light Industrial District at the easterly portion of the Village located on U.S. Highway 6, west of East 11th Street, as shown on the attached zoning district map as the hatched area, and in the overlay B-2(A) General Business, Adult Use District, as established by this Ordinance. In addition, any adult regulated use facility shall be surrounded by a perimeter buffer at least 50 feet wide and 6 feet high, consisting of shrubbery or plantings, to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission. Uses subject to these controls, hereafter referred to as adult regulated uses, are as follows:
Adult Bookstore
Adult motion picture theater
Adult mini-motion Picture Theater
Adult entertainment facility featuring nude or semi nude dancing or modeling
Such adult regulated uses as set forth above are hereby prohibited from all zoning districts within the Village, except as permitted in the overlay B-2 (A) General Business, Adult Use District, and I-1 Light Industrial District, as shown on the attached zoning district map in the hatched area.
B. Uses Presently Prohibited: None of the provisions of the Coal Valley Zoning Ordinance as amended pertaining to adult uses shall be construed to permit any use or activities that presently are, or in the future may be, prohibited by law.
C. Prohibition of Graphic Materials: Any building or structure, within which an adult regulated use is lawfully operated, shall not use or display graphic sexual material, photos or drawings on the exterior of said business,, but shall designate said business to be an “adult business” and admission granted to adults only.

Section 10. SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
10.001 PURPOSE. The development and administration of the Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into zoning districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the size and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land occupied are substantially uniform. The Ordinance recognizes, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring uses and of the public need for the particular use at the location being considered. Such special uses fall into two categories:
a. Uses publicly operated or traditionally influenced by a public interest,
b. Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact on neighboring property or public facilities.
10.002 INITIATION OF SPECIAL USE. Any person having a freehold interest in land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, any one of which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for in the Ordinance for the zoning district in which the land is located.
69
10.003 APPLICATION FOR A SPECIAL USE PERMIT. An application for a special use permit shall be filed with the Zoning Officer on a form prescribed by the Board of Appeals.

10.004 HEARING ON APPLICATION. Upon receipt of the application in proper form, the Board of Appeals shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed special use. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published in the official newspaper not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days preceding said hearing. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional forms of notice as the Board of Appeals may deem appropriate.
10.005 AUTHORIZATION. For each application for a special use permit the Zoning officer shall prepare and file with the Board of Appeals his findings and recommendations, including any recommended stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that he deems necessary for the protection of the public interest.
10.006 STANDARDS. No special use permit shall be granted by the Board of Appeals unless the Board finds:
a. That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to nor endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare;
b. That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor will substantially diminish property values within the neighborhood;
c. That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
d. That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been planned or are being provided;
e. That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public-streets; and
f. That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is to be located, except as such regulations may in each instance, be modified as the Board of Appeals deems appropriate,
10.007 CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES. Prior to the granting of any special use permit, the Board of Appeals shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the special use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements of this Section. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the Board of Appeals shall require such evidence and guarantees of the applicant as it may deem necessary to assure that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will continue to be complied with.
70
10.008 DENIAL AND REVOCATION OF A SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
a. DENIAL OF A SPECIAL USE PERMIT. An application for a special use permit that has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Appeals shall not be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the Board of Appeals.
b. REVOCATION OF A SPECIAL USE PERMIT. In any case where a use has not been established within one (1) year after the date of the granting of the permit, then without further action by the Board of Appeals, the special use permit is revoked and its authorization shall-be null and void.

Before authorizing a use for location in the “I” District, the Board shall determine whether the proposed use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance to the surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards, sewage wastes and pollution, transportation and traffic, and negative aesthetic and psychological effects.
