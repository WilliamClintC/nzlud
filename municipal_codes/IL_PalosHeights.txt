   The passage of all ordinances for whatever purpose, and of any
resolution or motion to create any liability against the city or for the
expenditure or appropriation of city money, shall require the concurrence of
a majority of all members then holding office on the city council, including
the mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided by law.  Where the council

the aldermen shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance.  The passage of an
ordinance, resolution or motion to sell any school property shall require the
concurrence of three-fourths of all aldermen then holding office.  The yeas
and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the designated
ordinances, resolutions, or motions, and recorded in the journal of the city
council.  In addition, the corporate authorities at any meeting may by
unanimous consent take a single vote by yeas and nays on the several
questions of the passage of any two or more of the designated ordinances,
orders, resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes in a
single group.  The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal
under the designation "omnibus vote", and in that event the clerk may enter
the words "omnibus vote" and in the that event the clerk may enter the words
"omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case instead of
entering the names of the members of city council voting "yea" and those
voting "nay" on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders,
resolutions and motions included in the omnibus group or consent agenda. 
The taking of a single or omnibus vote and the entries of the words "omnibus
vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance
with the requirements of the section to all intents and purposes and with
like effect as if the vote in each case had been taken separately by yeas and
nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and
motion included in the omnibus group and separately recorded in the
journal.  Likewise, the years and nays shall be taken upon the question of
the passage of any other resolution or motion at the request of any alderman,
and shall be recorded in the journal.

that provide for the expenditure or appropriation of city money, or that sell
any city or school property, and all ordinances passed by the city council,
shall be deposited with the city clerk.  Except as provided in ILCS Ch. 65,
Act 5, §§ 4-1-1 et seq. and 5-1-1 et seq., if the mayor approves of them,
he shall sign them.  Those of which he disapproves shall be returned to the
city council, with his written objections, at the next regular meeting of the
city council occurring not less than 5 days after their passage.  The mayor
may disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in any ordinance,
resolution, or motion making an appropriation, and, if so, the remainder
shall be effective.  However, the mayor may disapprove entirely of an
ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation.  If the mayor
fails to return any ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with his
written objections, within the designated time, it shall become effective
despite the absence of his signature.

   Every resolution and motion specified in § 31.14, and every ordinance
which is returned to the city council by the mayor, shall be reconsidered by
the city council.  If, after reconsideration, 2/3 of all the aldermen then
holding office on the city council agree to pass an ordinance, resolution, or
motion, notwithstanding the mayor's refusal to approve it, then it shall be
effective.  The vote on the question of passage over the mayor's veto shall
be by yeas and nays, and shall be recorded in the journal.

(Ord. O-38-98, passed 8-18-98)



§ 31.22  ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS RULES.



   (A)   Rules statement.  It is the decision of the city council that
any member of the corporate authority may attend any open or closed meeting
of the corporate authority via electronic means (such as by telephone, video
or internet connection) provided that such attendance is in compliance with
these rules and any applicable laws.



   (B)   Prerequisites.  A member of the corporate authority may
attend a meeting electronically if the member meets the following conditions:



      (1)   The member should notify the city clerk at least 72
hours before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary
communications equipment can be arranged.  Inability to make the necessary
technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote
attendance.



      (2)   The member must assert one of the following three
reasons why he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting.



         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal
illness or disability; or



         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment
purposes or the business of the city; or



         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or
other emergency.



   (C)   Authorization to participate.



      (1)   The city clerk, after receiving the electronic
attendance request, shall inform the corporate authorities of the request for
electronic attendance.



      (2)   After establishing that there is a quorum physically
present at meeting where a member of the corporate authorities desires to
attend electronically, the presiding officer shall state that (i) a notice
was received by a member of the corporate authorities in accordance with
these rules, and (ii) the member will be deemed authorized to attend the
meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to the members electronic
attendance is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the members of
the corporate authorities physically present at the meeting.  If no such
motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the
required vote by the members of the corporation authorities physically
present at the meeting, then the request by the member to attend the meeting
electronically shall be deemed approved by the corporate authorities and the
presiding officer shall declare the requesting member present.  After such
declaration by the presiding officer, the question of a members electronic
attendance may not be reconsidered.



   (D)   Adequate equipment required.  The member participating
electronically and other member of the corporate authorities must be able to
communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communications at the meeting site.  Before allowing electronic attendance
at any meeting, the corporate authorities shall provide equipment adequate to
accomplish this objective at the meeting site.



   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be
considered an off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for
that meeting if the member is allowed to attend.  The meeting minutes shall
also reflect and state specifically whether each member is physically present
or present by electronic means.



   (F)   Rights of remote member.  A member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted
and adhered to.  The member attending electronically shall be heard,
considered, and counted as to any vote taken.  Accordingly, the name of any
member attending electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and
his or her vote counted and recorded by the city clerk and placed in the
minutes for the corresponding meeting.  A member attending electronically
may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided the
member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and
returning.

§ 52.40  PROGRAM FOR ELIMINATION OF EXTRANEOUS FLOWS.



   (A)   Because of their almost instantaneous impact, their injurious
results, substantial contributions, and relative ease of correction, the city
will institute a priority program for the elimination of extraneous flows
entering into the sanitary sewer system through downspouts, roof drains and
other visible or outside connections which are connected directly or
indirectly to the sanitary sewer system.



   (B)   Within a period of 60 days starting in mid 1980, and at no
expense to the property owner, the city will make visual outside inspections
of all properties within the city with specific attention to downspouts, roof
drains and other visible or outside connections, and, if requested by the
property owner, the city will enter into the premises and make or assist in
the making of additional inspections of the premises to ascertain if illegal
connections are present. Upon completion of the visual outside or inside
inspection, the city will advise the property owner in writing if any illegal
connections are observed, and will advise on the manner of corrections for
compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.  After the corrections
are made the city will, at no expense to the owner, make further inspections
of the corrections to insure compliance with this subchapter.



   (C)   Within 30 days after notice to the property owner by the city
of the presence of illegal connections, the property owner shall, at his
expense, disconnect all illegal connections observed and all discharges of
extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer system, directly or indirectly,
shall be discontinued.

   In addition to visual inspections on the outside or the inside of the
premises as indicated in § 52.40, the city may make other tests and
inspections of the municipal sewer systems as it deems necessary in order to
locate such illegal connections and sources of extraneous flows as may
exist.  The city, at its option, may also invoke other legal powers vested
in it or implied by the statutes for the protection of the health and welfare
of the public, or institute such legal action as it deems necessary to
discover and order the disconnection of any illegal connections that may
exist.

   (A)   Green indication.



      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.



      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown
alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other
movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.



      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal, as provided in § 70.012, pedestrians facing any green signal, except
when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.



   (B)   Steady yellow indication.



      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or
yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is
being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter.



      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in § 70.012, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall
then start to cross the roadway.



   (C)   Steady red indication.



      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.



      (2)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the
intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.



      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and
the city by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit any
such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by divisions (C)(1) and
(C)(2) above.  After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to
any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely
as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving
across or within the intersection or junction or roadways.  Such driver
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an
adjacent crosswalk.



      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal
as provided in § 70.012, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red
arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.



   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application.  Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, or in the
absence of the sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.



   (E)   The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals as
applicable to vehicles.

speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or endangers the safety of any person
or property.  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when
approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when
traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists
with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or
highway conditions.  Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid
colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance
with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.



   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which
is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by

between the roadways moving in opposite directions; and



      (2)   55 per hour for all other highways, roads, and streets.



   (E)   Unless some lesser speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a second
division vehicle designed or used for the carrying of a gross weight of 8,001
pounds or more (including the weight of the vehicle and maximum load) is 55
miles per hour.



   (F)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a bus is:



      (1)   65 miles per hour upon any highway which has at least 4
lanes of traffic, and of which the roadways for traffic moving in opposite
directions are separated by a strip of ground which is not surfaced or
suitable for vehicular traffic, except that the maximum speed limit for a bus
on all highways, roads, or streets not under the jurisdiction of the
Department or the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority is 55 miles per hour;
and



      (2)   60 miles per hour on any other highway, except that the
maximum speed limit for a bus on all highways, roads, or streets not under
the jurisdiction of the Department or the Illinois State Toll Highway
Authority is 55 miles per hour.



   (G)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a house car,
camper, private living coach, vehicles licensed as recreational vehicles, and
any vehicle towing any other vehicle is 55 miles per hour or the posted speed
limit, whichever is less.

prosecution for speeding, provided the use of the device shall apply only to
the enforcement of the speed limit in the construction or maintenance speed
zone.



   (C)   (1)   As used in this section, a CONSTRUCTION OR
MAINTENANCE SPEED ZONE is an area in which the Department, toll highway
authority, a local agency, or the city has determined that the preexisting
established speed limit through a highway construction or maintenance project

traffic-control devices.



   (C)   Official traffic-control devices may be erected directing
specific traffic to use a designated lane or designating those lanes to be
used by traffic moving in a particular direction, regardless of the center of
the roadway, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such
device.  On multi-lane controlled-access highways with 3 or more lanes in
one direction, or on any multi-laned highway with 2 or more lanes in one
direction, the department may designate lanes of traffic to be used by
different types of motor vehicles.  Drivers must obey lane designation
signing except when it is necessary to use a different lane to make a turning
maneuver.



   (D)   Official traffic-control devices may be installed prohibiting
the changing of lanes on sections of roadway, and drivers of vehicles shall
obey the directions of every such device.

vehicle when traveling upon a roadway outside of a business or residence
district, and which is following another truck or motor vehicle drawing
another vehicle shall, whenever conditions permit, leave sufficient space so
that an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy the space without danger,
except that this shall not prevent a truck or motor vehicle drawing another
vehicle from overtaking and passing any vehicle or combination of vehicles.



   (C)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a
business or residence district in a caravan or motorcade, whether or not

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED



§ 71.035  OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN.




   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad
grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person
must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track
across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances
stated in this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less
than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed
until the tracks are clear and he or she can do so safely.  The foregoing
requirements shall apply when:




      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device
gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;



      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or
continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or
railroad track equipment;



      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching
a highway crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad  train or
railroad track equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing,
is an immediate hazard;



      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track
equipment is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;




      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is
approaching so closely that an immediate hazard is created.





   (B)   Whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad
grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop but must slow
down, the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a
railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the
circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall slow down within 50
feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and
shall not proceed until he or she checks that the tracks are clear of an
approaching train or railroad track equipment.




   (C)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under
any crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier
is closed or is being opened or closed.



   (D)   The department, and local authorities with the approval of the
department, are authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway grade
crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When stop signs are
erected, the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less
than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only
upon exercising due care.



   (E)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad
crossbuck signs, without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices,
crossing gates, or a human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage
of a train or railroad track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in
obedience to the railroad crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow
down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall stop, if
required for safety, at a clearly marked stop line, or if not stop line,
within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the
railroad and shall not proceed until he or she can do so safely.  If a
driver is involved in a collision at a railroad crossing or interferes with
the movement of a train or railroad track equipment after driving past the
railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima facie
evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.



   (F)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle,
fail to negotiate a railroad- highway grade railroad crossing because of
insufficient undercarriage clearance.



   (G)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.



      (1)   A violation of this section is a petty offense for which
a fine of $250 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $500
shall be imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose
25 hours of community service in place of the $250 fine for the first
violation.

building entrances and exits, bus stops, and loading areas, and is prohibited
from parking where the motor vehicle constitutes a traffic hazard, whereby
the motor vehicle shall be moved at the instruction and request of a law

this section or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-616 or such devices as local
authorities deem proper as evidence that the vehicle is operated by or for a

other lawful place, in any parking place specifically reserved for such
vehicles, by the posting of an official sign as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act
5, § 11-301.  Parking privileges granted by this section are strictly
limited to the person to whom the special registration plates, special decal,
or device were issued and to qualified operators acting under his express
direction while the person with disabilities is present. A person to whom
privileges were granted shall, at the request of a police officer or any

place, including any private or public off-street parking facility,

ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such
registration plates. It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle in a
designated access aisle adjacent to any parking place specifically reserved
for persons with disabilities, by the posting of an official sign as
designated under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-301, for motor vehicles

persons with disabilities, the parking decal or device must be displayed
properly in the vehicle where it is clearly visible to law enforcement

and devices are not transferable from person to person. Proper usage of the
disability license plate or parking decal or device requires the authorized
holder to be present and enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking
privileges are being used. It is a violation of this section to park in a
space reserved for a person with disabilities if the authorized holder of the
disability license plate or parking decal or device does not enter or exit
the vehicle at the time the parking privileges are being used. Any motor
vehicle properly displaying a disability license plate or a parking decal or
device containing the international symbol of access issued to persons with
disabilities by any local authority, state, district, territory or foreign
country shall be recognized by state and local authorities as a valid license
plate or device and receive the same parking privileges as residents of this
state.



      (2)   An individual with a vehicle displaying disability
license plates or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with
a disability under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2,
or to a disabled veteran under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-609, is in
violation of this section, if (i) the person using the disability license
plate or parking decal or device is not the authorized holder of the
disability license plate or parking decal, or device or is not transporting
the authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or
device to or from the parking location; and (ii) the person uses the
disability license plate or parking decal or device to exercise any
privileges granted through the disability license plate or parking decals or
devices under this code.

visible for at least 500 feet in the direction the motorcycle is
proceeding.  However, in lieu of a lighted lamp, a motorcycle may be
equipped with and use a means of modulating the upper beam of the head lamp
between high and a lower brightness.  No head lamp shall be modulated,
except to otherwise comply with this section, during times when lighted lamps
are required for other motor vehicles.



   (B)   All other motor vehicles shall exhibit at least two lighted
head lamps, with at least one on each side of the front of the vehicle,
showing white lights, or lights of a yellow or amber tint, during the period
from a half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise, at times when
rain, snow, fog, or other atmospheric conditions require the use of
windshield wipers, and at any other times when, due to insufficient light or
unfavorable atmospheric conditions, persons and vehicles on the highway are
not clearly discernible at a distance of 1000 feet.  Parking lamps may be
used in addition to but not in lieu of such headlamps.  Every motor vehicle,
trailer, or semitrailer shall also exhibit at least 2 lighted lamps, commonly
known as tail lamps, which shall be mounted on the left rear and right rear
of the vehicle so as to throw a red light visible for at least 500 feet in
the reverse direction, except that a motorcycle or a truck tractor or a road
tractor manufactured before January 1, 1968, need be equipped with only one
tail lamp.



   (C)   Either a tail lamp or a separate lamp shall be so constructed
and placed as to illuminate with a white light a rear registration plate when
required, and render it clearly legible from a distance of 50 feet to the
rear.  Any tail lamp or tail lamps, together with any separate lamp or lamps

§ 74.050  REAR FENDER SPLASH GUARDS.



   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to operate any vehicle of the
second division, except a truck tractor, to which this section is applicable,
upon any highway of this state unless the vehicle is equipped with rear
fender splash guards of either the contour type or the flap type which comply
with the specifications provided in this section for the type of splash
guards used on the vehicle, and which are so attached as to prevent the
splashing of mud or water upon the windshield of other motor vehicles.



   (B)   Specifications for contour type splash guards.  When contour
type rear fender splash guards are used, they shall contour the wheel in such
a manner that the relationship of the inside surface of any splash guard to
the tread surface of the tire or wheel shall be relatively parallel, both
laterally and across the wheel, at least throughout the top 90° of the rear
180° of the wheel surface; provided however, on vehicles which have a
clearance of less than 5 inches between the top of the tire or wheel and that
part of the body of the vehicle directly above the tire or wheel when the
vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity, the curved portion of the splash
guard need only extend from a point directly behind the center of the rear
axle and to the rear of the wheel surface upwards to within at least 2 inches
of the bottom line of the body when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal
capacity.  There shall be a downward extension of the curved surface which
shall end not more than 12 inches from the ground when the vehicle is loaded
to maximum legal capacity.  This downward extension shall be part of the
curved surface or attached directly to the curved surface, but it need not
contour the wheel.  Contour type splash guards shall be wide enough to cover
the full tread width of the tire or tires being protected, and shall be
installed not more than 6 inches from the tread surface of the tire or wheel
when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity.  The splash guard
shall have a lip or flange on its outside edge to minimize side throw and
splash.  The lip or flange shall extend toward the center of the wheel, and
shall be perpendicular to and extend not less than 2 inches below the inside
or bottom surface line or plane of the guard.  Contour type splash guards
may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material, but shall be
attached in such a manner that, regardless of movement either by the splash
guards or the vehicle, the splash guards will retain their general parallel
relationship to the tread surface of the tire or wheel under all ordinary
operating conditions.



   (C)   Specifications for flap type splash guards.  When flap type
splash guards are used, they shall be wide enough to cover the full tread
width of the tire or tires being protected; shall be so installed that they
extend from the underside of the vehicle in a vertical plane behind the rear
wheels to within 12 inches of the ground, when the vehicle is loaded to
maximum legal capacity; shall be so constructed and attached so that when the
vehicle is in forward motion, the splash guard will not deviate or move
backward from the vertical plane by an angle of more than 30° measured from
the vertical plane, and so that when the forward motion of the vehicle causes
the splash guard to deviate from the vertical plane, the bottom of the flap
type splash guard will not be more than 15 inches from the ground, when the
vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity.  The flap type splash guard may
be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material.



   (D)   Exemptions.  This section shall not apply to vehicles the
construction or design of which does not require splash guards, nor to
vehicles in transit and capable only of using temporary splash guards
prescribed by the department, nor to pole trailers.

   (H)   The department upon request from any local authority shall, or
upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of any bridge or other
elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the
structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of vehicles
otherwise permissible under this section the department shall determine and
declare the maximum weight of vehicles which the structures can withstand,
and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected
and maintained before each end of the structure.



   (I)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of
divisions (G) or (H) above proof of the determination of the maximum

§ 74.112  OFFICERS TO WEIGH VEHICLES AND REQUIRE REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOADS.



   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of
a vehicle and load is unlawful shall require the driver to stop and submit to
a weighing of the same, either by means of portable or stationary scales. If
the scales are not available at the place where the vehicle is stopped, the
police officer shall require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest
available scale that has been tested and approved by the Illinois department
of agriculture. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Weights and Measures
Act or the United States Department of Commerce NIST handbook 44, multi or
single draft weighing is an acceptable method of weighing by law enforcement
for determining a violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-100 et seq.  Law
enforcement is exempt from the requirements of commercial weighing
established in NIST handbook 44.



   (B)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and the load,
determines that the weight is unlawful, the officer shall require the driver
to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that
portion of the load is removed as may be necessary to reduce the weight of
the vehicle to the limit permitted under this chapter, or to the limit
permitted under the terms of a permit issued pursuant to §§ 74.120 through
74.139, and shall forthwith arrest the driver or owner. All material so
unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the
risk of the owner or operator.



   (C)   The department of transportation may, at the request of the
department of state police, erect appropriate regulatory signs on any state
highway directing second division vehicles to a scale.  Every second
division vehicle, pursuant to the sign, shall stop and be weighed.



   (D)   Whenever any axle load of a vehicle exceeds the weight limits
permitted by § 74.111 (A) or (F) by 2,000 pounds or less, the owner or
operator of the vehicle must shift or remove the excess so as to comply with
§ 74.111 (A) or (F).  No overweight arrest ticket shall be issued to the
owner or operator of the vehicle by any officer if the gross weight is either
shifted or removed as required by this division.



   (E)   Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross
weight of 80,000 pounds or less exceeds the weight limits of § 74.111(B) or
(F) by 2,000 pounds or less, the owner or operator of the vehicle must remove
the excess.  Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross
weight of 80,000 pounds or more exceeds the weight limits of § 74.111(B) or
(F) by 1,000 pounds or less than 2,000 pounds, the owner or operator of the
vehicle must remove the excess.  In either case no arrest ticket for any
overweight violation of this subchapter shall be issued to the owner or
operator of the vehicle by any officer if the excess weight is removed as
required by this division.  A person who has been granted a special permit
under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15-301 shall not be granted a tolerance on
wheel load weighers.



   (F)   Whenever an axle load of a vehicle exceeds axle weight limits
allowed by the provisions of a permit, an arrest ticket shall be issued, but
the owner or operator of the vehicle may shift the load so as to comply with
the provisions of the permit. Where shifting of a load to comply with the
permit is accomplished, the owner or operator of the vehicle may then proceed.



   (G)   Any driver of a vehicle who refuses to stop and submit his
vehicle and load to weighing after being directed to do so by an officer, or
removes or causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to weighing, is
guilty of a business offense, and shall be fined not less than $500 nor more
than $2,000.

provisions of a permit issued under the provisions of §§ 74.120 through
74.139 by operating under a fraudulent permit or under a permit not
specifically covering the move, the owner or driver of the vehicle shall be
deemed guilty of a business offense, and either the owner or the driver of
the vehicle may be prosecuted for the violation.  When any person, firm, or
corporation is convicted of a violation, the permit shall be null and void
and the person, firm, or corporation shall be fined in an amount not to
exceed $500, not less than $.10 per pound for each pound the gross weight of
the vehicle exceeds the gross weight of vehicles allowable under § 74.111.



   (B)   Penalties for violations of this section shall be in addition
to any penalties imposed for violation of § 74.120 (J).

PERMITS AND FEES



§ 74.120  PERMITS FOR EXCESS SIZE AND WEIGHT.



   (A)   Upon written application, the city clerk may issue a special
permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination
of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in this chapter, or otherwise not in conformity with this
chapter.  Except for an application to move directly across a highway, the
application shall show that the load to be moved by the vehicle or
combination of vehicles is composed of a single, nondivisible object that
cannot reasonably be dismantled or disassembled.



   (B)   The application for any such permit shall:



      (1)   State whether the permit is requested for a single trip
or for limited continuous operation;



      (2)   State if the applicant is an authorized carrier under
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, 18c-1101 et seq.; if so, his certificate, registration,
or permit number issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission;



      (3)   Specifically describe and identify the vehicle or
vehicles and load to be operated or moved, except that for vehicles or
vehicle combinations registered by the department as provided in § 74.139,
only the Illinois Department of Transportation's (IDT) registration number or
classification need be given;



      (4)   State the routing requested, including the points of
origin and destination, and may identify and include a request for routing to
the nearest certified scale in accordance with the department's rules and
regulations, provided the applicant has approval to travel on local roads; and



      (5)   State if the vehicles or loads are being transported for
hire.



   (C)   No permits for the movement of a vehicle or load for hire
shall be issued to any applicant who is required under ILCS  Ch. 625, Act 5,
§§ 18c-1101 et seq. to have a certificate, registration, or permit, and
does not have the certificate, registration, or permit.



   (D)   The clerk, when not inconsistent with traffic safety, is
authorized to issue or withhold a permit at his discretion; or if the permit
is issued at his discretion, to prescribe the route or routes to be traveled;
to limit the number of trips; to establish seasonal or other time limitations
within which the vehicles described may be operated on the highways
indicated; or otherwise to limit or prescribe conditions of operations of the
vehicle or vehicles, when necessary to assure against undue damage to the
road foundations, surfaces, or structures, and may require undertaking or
other security as may be deemed necessary to compensate for any injury to any
roadway or road structure.



   (E)   As an exception to division (A) of this section, the city,
with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, in its discretion and upon
application in writing, may issue a special permit for limited continuous
operation, authorizing the applicant to move loads of sweet corn, soybeans,
corn, wheat, milo, and other small grains and ensilage during the harvest
season only on a two-axle single vehicle registered by the secretary of state
with axle loads not to exceed 35% above those provided in § 74.111. 
Permits may be issued for a period not to exceed 40 days, and moves may be
made of a distance not to exceed 25 miles from a field to a specified
processing plant over any highway except the National System of Interstate
and Defense Highways.  All such vehicles shall be operated in the daytime
except when weather or crop conditions require emergency operation at night,
but with respect to night operation, every vehicle with load shall be
equipped with flashing amber lights as specified under § 74.015.  Upon a
declaration by the Governor that an emergency harvest situation exists, a
special permit issued by the Department under this section shall not be
required for September 1 through December 31 during harvest season
emergencies, provided that the weight does not exceed 20% above the limits
provided in § 74.111.  All other restrictions that apply to permits issued
under this section shall apply during the declared time period.  With
respect to highways under the jurisdiction of local authorities, the local
authorities may, at their discretion, waive special permit requirements
during harvest season emergencies.  This permit exemption shall apply to all
vehicles eligible to obtain permits under this section, including commercial
vehicles in use during the declared time period.



   (F)   The form and content of the permit shall be determined by the
department.  Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers, and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit, and no
person shall violate any of the terms or conditions of the special permit. 
Violation of the terms and conditions of the permit shall not be deemed a
revocation of the permit.  No rule or regulation, nor anything herein shall
be construed to authorize any police officer, court, or authorized agent of
any authority granting the permit to remove the permit from the possession of
the permittee.  However, upon arrest for a violation of the permit, the
permittee, or his agent, must produce the permit at any court hearing
concerning the alleged violation of permit.  If the permit designates and
includes a routing to a certified scale, the permittee, while en route to the
designated scale, shall be deemed in compliance with the weight provisions of
the permit providing the axle or gross weights do not exceed any of the
permitted limits by more than the following amounts.



      Jingle axle      2000 pounds



      Tandem axle      3000 pounds



      Gross         5000 pounds



   (F)   Violation of any rule, limitation, or condition or provision
of any permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall
not render the entire permit null and void, but the violator shall be deemed
guilty of exceeding any size, weight, or load limitations in excess of those
authorized by the permit.



   (G)   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made under a
fraudulent permit, the permit shall be void, and the person, firm, or
corporation to whom the permit was granted, the driver of the vehicle, in
addition to the person who issued the permit and any accessory, shall be
guilty of fraud and either one or all persons may be prosecuted for the
violation.  Any person, firm, or corporation committing the violation shall
be guilty of a class 4 felony and the violators shall be prosecuted under
state law, and the person, firm, or corporation guilty of the violation shall
not be issued any permits for a period of one year after the date of
conviction.  Penalties for violations of this section shall be in addition
to any penalties imposed for violation of other sections of this chapter.



   (I)   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made in violation
of a permit issued in accordance with this section, the person to whom the
permit was granted, or the driver of the vehicle, is guilty of the violation
and either, but not both, persons may be prosecuted for the violation as
stated in this division.  Any person, firm, or corporation convicted of a
violation shall be guilty of a petty offense, and shall be fined for the
first offense, not less than $50 nor more than $200 and, for the second
offense by the same person, firm, or corporation within a period of one year,
not less than $200 nor more than $300 and, for the third offense by the same
person, firm, or corporation within a period of one year after the date of
the first offense, not less than $300 nor more than $500, and the clerk shall
not issue permits to the person, firm, or corporation convicted of a third
offense during a period of one year after the date of conviction for the
third offense.



   (J)   Whenever any vehicle is operated on local roads under permits
for excess width or length issued by local authorities, the vehicle may be
moved upon a state highway for a distance not to exceed 1/2 mile without a

be moved from the same origin to the same destination, the number of trips
will not be less than 5, the trips will be completed within 30 days, and all
applications are submitted at one time.  Round trip permits shall be the
same as a single trip permit except the fee shall be computed based on the
total distance traveled, and shall be for the same vehicle, vehicle
combination or like load traveling both directions over the same route,
provided a description including make and model of the equipment being
transported is furnished to the department, except that a vehicle combination
registered by the department as provided in § 74.139 may be one of the same
class.  Limited continuous operation permits are to be valid for a period of
90 days or one year, and shall be for the same vehicle, vehicle combination,

to the person at his address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the
statutory summary suspension shall begin as provided in division (G).  The

person at the time of arrest.  If the person has a valid driver's license or
permit, the officer shall issue the person a receipt, in a form prescribed by
the Secretary of State, that will allow that person to drive during the
periods provided for in division (G).  The officer shall immediately forward
the driver's license or permit to the circuit court of venue along with the
sworn report provided for in division (D).



   (G)   The statutory summary suspension referred to in this section
shall take effect on the 46th day following the date the notice of the

§ 80.01  PURPOSE.



   This chapter provides for an automated traffic law enforcement system,
which detects motor vehicles which fail to abide by traffic-control signals
at intersections under penalty of a fine, and a system of administrative
adjudication by which such detected infractions shall be resolved.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.02  VIOLATION.



   (A)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for anyone to operate
a vehicle in disregard of a traffic control device or to turn right on a red
light where it is posted No Turn on Red.



   (B)   The city shall have the discretion to locate individual
automated traffic law enforcement systems at such intersections as may be
deemed appropriate.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.03  DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   Detection. As used in the section:



      AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM means a device within
the city with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a
red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an
intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation
of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS Act 5, § 11-306. The
AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM shall not be used to enforce speed
limit regulations. The recorded images produced by the automated traffic law
enforcement system, which consist of either two or more photographs, two or
more electronic images of a video recording showing the motor vehicle, shall
capture and display images of the vehicle allegedly violating traffic-control
signals, together with the license plate on such vehicle, and shall also show
the time, date and location of the violation.



   (B)   Signage. Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic
law enforcement system must have a sign posted which is visible to
approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an
automated traffic law enforcement system.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.04  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



   (A)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a
motor vehicle entering an intersection in spite of a steady or flashing red
signal indicating a violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code,
625 ILCS Act 5, § 11-306, this shall be deemed a non-criminal violation for
which a civil penalty of $100 shall be assessed and for which no points shall
be assigned by the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code Point System for License
Suspension to the owner or driver of the vehicle.



   (B)   The city shall issue a written notice of the violation to the
registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by first
class mail within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the
city of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in
no event later than 90 days following the violation. If the notice of
violation is returned as undeliverable, then the notice of violation shall be
sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office
approved database, which notice shall still be sent within 90 days of the
violation.



   (C)   Each notice of violation associated with an automated traffic
law violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by an
officer of the city police department empowered under this ordinance to
determine whether a red light offense has occurred. Upon determination that
the recorded image captures a violation of one of the foregoing provisions,
the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in
the manner provided for below.



   (D)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall retain a copy of
all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
alleged violator. Each notice of violation, which shall constitute evidence
of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding
alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and
shall establish prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal,
shall include the following:



      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee
of the vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if
such information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address
recorded in a United States Post Office approved database;



      (2)   The registration number of the motor vehicle involved in
the violation;



      (3)   The violation charged, with specific reference to that
section of the City of Palos Heights Municipal Code of Ordinances allegedly
violated;



      (4)   The location where the violation occurred;



      (5)   the date and time of the violation;



      (6)   A copy of the recorded images;



      (7)   The amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by
which the civil penalty should be paid if liability for the violation is not
going to be contested;



      (8)   A statement that the recorded images are evidence of a
violation of a red light signal;



      (9)   A warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty
or to contest liability within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of
violation in writing or by attending the administrative hearing is an
admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving
privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle in addition to
the specified penalties for failing to appear at the hearing or pay the fine
in advance of the hearing;



      (10)   The date, time and place of the administrative hearing
at which the charge may be contested on its merits, a date that shall be no
less than 15 days from the mailing or other service of the first notice of
violation;



      (11)   A statement that payment of the indicated fine and of
any applicable penalty for late payment shall constitute a final disposition
of the violation; and



      (12)   The signature of the party reviewing the recorded
images and confirming that a violation took place.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.05  HEARINGS.



   (A)   The registered owner or lessee of a motor vehicle being
operated in violation of an automated traffic law violation herein may
request a hearing in persona to challenge the evidence or contest the
citation by mall. The violation notice shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of applicable defenses. Formal
rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing. Hearings shall be recorded,
and the hearing officer shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure
by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production
of relevant book and papers. Persons appearing at the hearing may be
represented by counsel at their own expense. A registered owner or lessee
that fails to appear at a hearing, which he or she has requested will be
found in default and a final determination will be entered.



   (B)   The following may be considered defenses by the hearing
officer for a violation:



      (1)   The operator of the vehicle was issued a uniform traffic
control citation by a police officer for the same incident;



      (2)   The motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor
vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control
of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation. Provided,
however, to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates
were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or
possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit
proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration
plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.



      (3)   The vehicle was leased to another, and within 60 days
after the citation was mailed to the lessor, lessor submitted to the city,
together with a copy of the lease agreement, the lessee's driver's license
number, and any additional information as may be required; or



      (4)   The operator of the vehicle passed through the
intersection when the light was red in order to yield the right-of-way to an
emergency vehicle or as part of a funeral procession.



   (C)   Any person challenging a citation by mail shall send a signed
statement, together with any supporting documentation, to the administrator
via certified mail, return receipt requested, within 30 days after service of
the violation notice. Such statement shall set forth the reasons why a
finding of liability should not be entered. The administrator shall forward
all timely-submitted materials to the hearing officer for review and
determination. Notice of the hearing officer's determination shall be sent by
mail to the owner.



   (D)   No additional fee shall be charged to an alleged violator for
exercising the right to an administrative hearing.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.06  FINAL DETERMINATION VIOLATION LIABILITY.



   A final determination of an automated traffic law violation liability
shall occur under the following circumstances:



   (A)   Upon the failure to pay the penalty or request a hearing
within 30 days, or after the hearing officer's determination of liability and
the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust administrative review; or



   (B)   Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the
alleged violation in the time and manner specified, the hearing officer's
determination shall become final upon the denial of a timely petition to set
aside a determination, or upon the expiration of the time period for filing
the petition without a filing having been made.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.07  COLLECTION OF FINES AND PENALTIES.



   Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the city from pursuing
all available remedies, allowed by law, to collect fines and payment of
penalties owed to city.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.08  NOTICE OF IMPENDING DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION.



   This notice shall be sent via first class United States mail, postage
prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State of any person
liable for any fine or penalty due and owing the city for five or more unpaid
automated traffic law violations. If such mailing is returned as
undeliverable, then the city shall send the notice to the last known address
recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, if city
subsequently makes a certified report to the Secretary of State, the subject
vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in writing.
To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the Administrator a written
statement under oath, together with supporting documentation, establishing
one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the certified
report:



   (A)   That the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject
vehicle or vehicles receiving five or more automated traffic law violations
on the date or dates such violation notices were issued; or



   (B)   That the person already paid the fines or penalties for the
five or more automated traffic law violations indicated on the certified
report. Such statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the
Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivered
to the Administrator within five days after the person receives notice from
the Secretary of State that the person's driver's license will be suspended
at the end of a specified period of time unless the Secretary is presented
with a notice from the city certifying that the fines or penalties due and
owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's name on the
certified report was in error.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.09  PROCEDURES FOR NON-RESIDENTS.

resident of the city but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged
violation, such persons may contest the charges using the same available
defenses, and the same procedures - they may attend the administrative
hearing or they may submit any and all documentary evidence no later than the
hearing date referenced in the notice of liability, together with a written
statement reflecting that they are non-residents of the city.



(Ord. O-17-16, passed 8-16-16)



§ 80.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   If the civil penalty of $100 referred to in § 80.04 herein is
not timely paid or the notice of violation referred to in § 80.04 herein is
not contested timely, a $100 penalty will be assessed in addition to the
original $100 fine by way of Final Determination of Violation Liability.



   (B)   The city, through its Treasurer, Clerk, Police Department, Law
Department, Administrative Adjudication Program, and/or any other designated
agent of the city, may establish procedures for the collection of the civil
penalty imposed.

the operation or conduct of the event is in violation of any conditions,
rules, and/or regulations imposed on the permit, any applicable provisions of

to the applicant, the permittee, the event manager, and the sponsor, if any,
via electronic mail and U.S. Postal Service mail, or personally served upon
the permittee or upon the event manager, or designee, at the time of
revocation. Unless the permit will expire by its own terns before a hearing
can be reasonably scheduled, no revocation will take effect until the sponsor
and/or permittee have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. When
necessary to prevent an immediate threat to the health or safety of the
public, the City Clerk, the City Administrator or the Chief of Police, or
their designee, shall be and is hereby authorized to order the permittee to
immediately cancel and require all activities of the event to cease.

other approved material, and built to specifications outlined in the building
code.



   (C)   When an existing garage is converted to living space, or when
a garage is removed, the driveway must be removed and constructed according
to existing ordinances.  Existing driveways may remain until such time as
the new garage is constructed, at which time the existing driveway must be
removed, except when:  the existing driveway leads to the new garage; or
when a part of the existing driveway can be incorporated into a new
configuration leading to the new garage, as long as the new configuration
complies with all aspects of this chapter, and constructed in accordance with
this section.



   (D)   No easement may be converted to parking space by adding stone,

   (H)   When a driveway is constructed on the side yard of a corner
residence, the side yard square footage shall be calculated by the same
formula as that used for front yards. In the case of corner residences, if

the corner may be counted only once).

driveway committee member(s) who may make a site visit and a recommendation
to the building commissioner as to acceptance or denial of request.

coverings of any type shall be calculated into the square footage formula of
surface coverage permitted (30%).



   (L)   This section applies to new construction of a driveway and any
change to an existing driveway which changes the original footprint of the
existing driveway, with the exception of making the footprint configuration
smaller and more into compliance with this chapter only and to the front yard
of residential property only.  The front yard is defined in the Zoning Code
as A yard extending across the front of a lot between the side yard lot
lines, and being the minimum horizontal distance between the street line and
the principal building, other than the projection of usual roof overhangs or
uncovered steps.

the applicant when the permit is issued.

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the Local Tax  Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax
due.  A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay
the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before
the date of filing the application.  A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary
disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or
penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if
the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be  deemed invalid
and void.  The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator. However any additional amounts owed
as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

that the property owner may undertake to abate the nuisance;



               d.    Such notice will require the
elimination of the nuisance within 30 days after the notice to the property
owner, although, upon a showing of good cause, said period may be extended by
the city for a reasonable period. In the event that the nuisance is not
abated within 30 days following receipt of notice by the property owner, or
within any further time period allowed by the city, the city is authorized to
cause the abatement of said nuisance, and the reasonable cost of such
abatement shall be filed as a lien against the property on which the nuisance
was located, and the property owner of the property upon which the nuisance
is located shall be subject to prosecution under this article. Nothing in
this provision shall be construed to exempt any person from the requirements
of obtaining approvals under this article.



            3.   The provisions of this article
notwithstanding, the Building Commissioner is hereby empowered to, and all
the fees associated with the lien, cause the immediate abatement of any
public nuisance under this article, provided that the



nuisance is declared by the city or designee to threaten imminent and serious

property on which the nuisance is located cannot be found through the
reasonable efforts of the Building Commissioner.



            4.   If the Building Commissioner causes trees or
plants to be cut, trimmed, or removed as provided in this chapter, a notice
of lien of the cost and expense incurred by the city shall be recorded as
provided in 1LCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-7, as amended from time to time. The
city or the person performing the service by authority of the city, shall
within 60 days thereafter file a notice of lien in the office of the county
recorder of deeds. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement
setting out: (1) a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof; (2) the amount of money representing the cost and
expense incurred or payable for the service, to include recording charges for
the lien and a release of lien; (3) the date when such cost and expense was
incurred by the city. In addition to filing a notice of lien with the
recorder of deeds, notice of such lien also shall be personally served on, or
sent by certified mail to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the
general taxes on the property for the last preceding year. Every lien
recorded pursuant to this section shall include a charge to recover the costs
expended by the city in preparing said lien, plus the actual recording cost
as determined by the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.



            5.   Upon payment of the cost and expense after a
notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the city or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be filed
of record in the same manner as filing the notice of the lien.



            6.   Real estate subject to a lien for unpaid
cutting, trimming, or removal costs and expenses may be sold for nonpayment
of the same, subject to the statutory rights of bona fide purchasers or prior
lienors, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay such costs and
expenses, after deducting court costs and legal fees, as in the case of the
foreclosure of statutory liens.



            7.   The City Attorney is hereby authorized and
directed to institute such foreclosure proceedings, which shall be in equity
and in the name of the city, in any court of proper jurisdiction, against any
real estate for which the cutting costs and expenses have remained unpaid for
60 days after being incurred.



            8.   The Building Commissioner is hereby empowered
to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction an order directing the

      (2)   For interstate inter-office channels having more than
two channel termination points, one or more of which are in the city, an
amount equal to the total charge multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of

provided within the city for that period.

infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications

   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infra-structure

request, and the telecommunications retailer shall provide, written

underpayment made by the city within the applicable statutory period of

telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.

of the amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city plus 5% of the
total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5%

shall be paid to the city within 21 days after the date of issuance of an
invoice for same.

forth herein for the total floor area specifically occupied by the particular
commercial establishment classification; provided, as follows:

to protect them in the peaceful enjoyment of their homes, while allowing all
persons reasonable exercise of free speech and political expression as
guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  This
policy is implemented in part on the basis of the judgment of the governing
authorities of the city that some door-to-door solicitation exposes city
residents during nighttime hours or after 9:00 p.m. exposes city residents to
unnecessary and unreasonable risks to their safety and should be regulated,
and that the rights of privacy of families and single persons in this
community should be protected from invasion during such hours.



   (B)   Every person desiring to secure the protection intended to be
provided by the regulations pertaining to soliciting contained in this
subchapter, shall comply with the following directions, to wit:

invitation to solicitors, or the refusal of invitation to solicitors, to any
residence, shall be given in the manner following:



         (a)   A waterproof decal/card, approximately 3 by 4
inches in size, shall be exhibited upon or near the main entrance door to the
residence, indicating the determination by the occupant, containing the
applicable words NO SOLICITORS INVITED.



         (b)   The letters shall be at least 1/3- inch in
height.  For the purpose of uniformity, the decals/cards shall be provided
by the City Clerk's Office to persons requesting.



         (c)   The card so exhibited shall constitute sufficient
notice to any solicitor of the determination by the occupant of the residence
of the information contained thereon.

premises in the city upon which a residence as herein described is located to
first examine the notice provided for in § 111.06(B)(1)(a), if any is
attached, and be governed by the statement contained in the notice, and shall
immediately and peacefully depart from the premises.

time for compliance has elapsed, the health officer finds that the same
violation has not been cured, the health officer may suspend the license
immediately.



      (5)   Provided, that where the continued operation of a
food-service establishment shall, in the judgment of the health officer, be a
serious menace to public health because of any violation by the licensee of
any provision of this chapter, the health officer shall, without a second
inspection, immediately suspend the license.  By means of the inspection
report, or other notice, the health officer shall notify the licensee of the
violation upon which he bases his judgment.



   (E)   Examination and condemnation of food.



      (1)   Food may be examined or sampled by the health officer as
often as may be necessary to determine freedom from adulteration.  The
health officer may, upon written notice to the licensee, place a hold order
on any food which he determines or has probable cause to believe to be
unwholesome or otherwise adulterated or contaminated with foreign matter. 
Under a hold order, food shall be permitted to be suitably stored.  It shall
be unlawful for any person to remove or alter a hold order, notice, or tag
placed on food by the health officer, and no such food shall be reprocessed,
altered, disposed of, or destroyed without permission of the health officer,
except on the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The licensee may,
if he so desires, file with the health officer, within 10 days from the
issuance of the hold order, a written request for a hearing. After the
licensee has had a hearing, and on the basis of evidence produced at the
hearing, or on the basis of the health officer's examination in the event a
written request for a hearing is not received within 10 days, the health
officer may vacate the hold order, or may by written order direct the
licensee to denature or destroy the food which was placed under the hold
order to bring it into compliance with this chapter. However, the order of
the health officer to denature or destroy the food or bring it into
compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be stayed if the order
is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction within 3 days.



      (2)   The health officer may suspend immediately the license
of the licensee who, having received a written notice or order relating to
the provision of this section, violates any requirements of this section to
which the notice or order relates.



   (F)   Procedure when infection suspected.



      (1)   When the health officer has reasonable cause to suspect
the possibility of disease transmission from any food-service establishment
employee, the health officer shall secure a morbidity history of the
suspected employee, or make such other investigation as may be indicated, and
take the appropriate action.  The health officer may require any and all of
the following measures:



         (a)   The restriction of the employee's services to some
area of the establishment where there would be no danger of transmitting
disease or the immediate exclusion of the employee from the food-service

establishment concerned until, in the opinion of the health officer, no
further danger of disease outbreak exists; and



         (c)   Adequate medical and laboratory examinations of
the employee, or other employees, and of his or their bodily discharges.



      (2)   The health officer may suspend immediately the license
of any licensee who, after written order given him by the health officer,
fails or refuses to comply with the requirements set forth in (a) or (b) of
this division, or who refuses to exclude from the food-service establishment
any employee who does not cooperate in the investigation and examination
provided by this division.

revocation proceedings are begun, the health officer shall suspend
immediately the license concerned without any notice other than the written
notice provided for in § 113.24 (J) (Revocation of license).  The
suspension shall continue in force and effect until a decision as to
revocation has been made by the mayor in accordance with § 113.24 (J).

licensee's license is immediately suspended;

a reinspection for the purpose of reinstatement of the license. Within 10
days following receipt of a written request, including a statement by the
applicant that, in his opinion, the conditions causing suspension of the
license have been corrected, the health officer shall make a reinspection. 
If the applicant is complying with the requirements of this chapter, the
license shall be reinstated.

not permit the licensee to sell liquor, wine, or beer in original packages
not for consumption on the premises.



   (B)   Retailer's class B license. Permits the sale or offer for sale

provided that the sale of liquor, wine, or beer, or offer for sale at retail,
is not the principal business of licensed premises, but is incidental to the
business, such as the case of package liquor departments in a food market or
drugstore.  A "retailer's class B license" does not permit the licensee to

(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-4)



§ 130.10  KNOWLEDGE.



   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:



      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her
conduct, described by the statute defining the offense, when he or she is
consciously aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those
circumstances exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the
substantial probability that the fact exists.



      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the
statute defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that
result is practically certain to be caused by his or her conduct.



   (B)   Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed
willfully, within the meaning of a statute using the term willfully,
unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.



   (C)   When the law provides that acting knowingly suffices to
establish an element of an offense, the element is also established if a
person acts intentionally.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-5)



§ 130.11  RECKLESSNESS.



   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when  that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense; and
that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.  An act performed
recklessly is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a statute using the
term wantonly, unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-6)



§ 130.12  NEGLIGENCE.



   A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to
be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-7)



§ 130.13  IGNORANCE OR MISTAKE.



   (A)   A person's ignorance or mistake as to a matter of either fact
or law, except as provided in § 130.08 (C), is a defense if it negatives the
existence of the mental state which the section prescribes with respect to an
element of the offense.



   (B)   A person's reasonable belief that his or her  conduct does
not constitute an offense is a defense if:



      (1)   The offense is defined by an administrative regulation
or order which is not known to him or her and has not been published or
otherwise made reasonably available to him or her, and he or she could not
have acquired such knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to
facts known to him or her; or



      (2)   He or she acts in reliance upon a section which later is
determined to be invalid; or



      (3)   He or she acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of
an Illinois Appellate or Supreme Court, or a United States appellate court
later overruled or reversed;



      (4)   He or she acts in reliance upon an official
interpretation of the section, regulation, or order defining the offense,
made by a public officer or agency legally authorized to interpret such
section.



   (C)   Although a person's ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or
reasonable belief, described in this section is a defense to the offense
charged, he or she may be convicted of an included offense of which he or she
would be guilty if the fact or law were as he or she believed it to be.



   (C)   Although a person's ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or
reasonable belief, described in this section is a defense to the offense
charged, he may be convicted of an included offense of which he would be
guilty if the fact or law were as he believed it to be.



   (D)   A defense based upon this section is an affirmative defense.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-8)



§ 130.14  ABSOLUTE LIABILITY.



   A person may be guilty of an offense without having, as to each element
thereof, one of the mental states described in §§ 130.09 through 130.12 if
the offense is a misdemeanor which is not punishable by incarceration or by a
fine exceeding $1,000, or the section defining the offense clearly indicates
a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-9)



§ 130.15  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONDUCT OF ANOTHER.



   A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense
if the conduct is either that of the person himself or herself or that of
another and he or she is legally accountable for such conduct as provided in
§ 130.16, or both.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 5-1)



§ 130.16  WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTS.



   (A)   A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another
when:



      (1)   Having a mental state described by the statute defining
the offense, he or she causes another to perform the conduct, and other
person in fact or by reason of legal incapacity lacks such a mental state;



      (2)   The statute defining the offense makes him or her so
accountable;



      (3)   Either before or during the commission of an offense,
and with the intent to promote or facilitate that commission, he or she
solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid that other person in the
planning or commission of the offense.



   (B)   When two or more persons engage in a common criminal design or
agreement, any acts in the furtherance of that common design committed by one
party are considered to be the acts of all parties to the common design or
agreement, and all are equally responsible for the consequences of those
farther acts.  Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not render a
person accountable for an offense; a person's presence at the scene of a
crime, however, may be considered with other circumstances by the trier of
fact when determining accountability.



   (C)   A person is not so accountable, however, unless the statute
defining the offense provides otherwise, if:



      (1)   He or she is a victim of the offense committed;



      (2)   The offense is so defined that his or her  conduct was
inevitably incident to its commission; or



      (3)   Before the commission of the offense, he or she
terminates his or her effort to promote or facilitate that commission, and
does one of the following: (i) wholly deprives his or her prior efforts of
effectiveness in that commission, (ii) gives timely warning to the proper law
enforcement authorities, or (iii) otherwise makes proper effort to prevent
the commission of the offense.

felony, and a person convicted of solicitation of murder shall be sentenced
to a term of imprisonment of not less than 15 years and not more than 30
years, except that a person convicted of solicitation of murder when the
person solicited was a person under the age of 17 years shall be sentenced to
a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years and not more than 60 years.

agreement is alleged and proved to have been committed by him or her or by a
co-conspirator.



   (B)   Co-conspirators.  It is not a defense to conspiracy that the
person or persons with whom the accused is alleged to have conspired:

      (2)   Have been convicted of a different offense,

act that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.

impossible for the accused to commit the offense attempted.



   (C)   Sentence.  A person convicted of attempt may be fined or

§ 135.12  OBSCENITY.



   (A)   Elements of the offense.  A person commits obscenity when,
with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to
exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or
content thereof, he:



      (1)   Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to

represented or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.



   (B)   Obscene defined.  A thing is OBSCENE if, considered as a
whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or
morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, and if it goes substantially
beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such
matters.  A thing is OBSCENE even though the obscenity is latent, as in the
case of undeveloped photographs.



   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.



      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary
adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other
specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the
material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed
for or directed to such an audience.



      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.



      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section,
evidence shall be admissible to show:



         (a)   The character of the audience for which the
material was designed or to which it was directed;



         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would
be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it
would probably have on the behavior of such people;



         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational,
or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;



         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the
material in this state;



         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof,
in advertising or other promotion of the material;



         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or
disseminator.



   (D)   Sentence.  Obscenity is a misdemeanor.  A second or
subsequent offense is a class 4 felony and shall be prosecuted under
appropriate state law.



   (E)   Prima facie evidence.  The creation, purchase, procurement,
or possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than 3 copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent
to disseminate.



   (F)   Affirmative defenses.  It shall be an affirmative defense to
obscenity that the dissemination:



      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates
other than children under 18 years of age;



      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or
other special justification for possession of such material.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 11-20)  Penalty, see § 130.99



§ 135.13  HARMFUL MATERIAL.



   (A)   Elements of the offense.  A person who, with knowledge that a
person is a child, that is a person under 18 years of age, or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly
distributes to, or sends, or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers
to distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.



   (B)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section:



      (1)   HARMFUL.  Material is harmful if, to the average
person, applying contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a
whole, is to prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in
nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits
of candor in description or representation of such matters, and is material
the redeeming social importance of which is substantially less than its
prurient appeal.



      (2)   MATERIAL.  Any writing, picture, record, or other
representation or embodiment.



      (3)   DISTRIBUTE.  To transfer possession of, whether with or
without consideration.



      (4)   KNOWINGLY.  Having knowledge of the contents of the
subject matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which
would have disclosed the contents thereof.



   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.



      (1)   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the
material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same
general age of the child to whom the material was offered, distributed, sent,
or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is
designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant
appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or
probable recipient group.



      (2)   In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances
of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake  of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance
of the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.



   (D)   Distribution of harmful material in violation of this section
is a misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a class 4 felony and
shall be prosecuted under appropriate state statute.



   (E)   Affirmative defenses.



      (1)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public
library or any library operated by an accredited institution of higher
education from circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of
age, provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or
educational purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this section that the act charged was
committed in aid of legitimate scientific or educational purposes.



      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from
distributing to his child any harmful material.



      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown, and acted
in reliance upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a
child, shall be a defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: A
document issued by the federal government or any state, county, or municipal
government or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a
motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the
Federal Selective Service Act or an identification card issued to a member of
the armed forces.



      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as
defined in this section culminates in the sale or distribution of harmful
material to a child, under circumstances where there was no personal
confrontation of the child by the defendant, his employees, or agents, as
where the order or request for harmful material was transmitted by mail,
telephone, or similar means of communication, and delivery of the harmful
material to the child was by mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it
shall be a defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that
the advertisement contained the following statement, or a statement
substantially similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser
to certify that he was not under 18 years of age and that the purchaser
falsely stated that he was not under 18 years of age: "NOTICE: It is unlawful
for any person under 18 years of age to purchase the matter herein
advertised. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states that he is
not under 18 years of age for the purpose of obtaining the material
advertised herein, is guilty of a misdemeanor under the laws of the State of
Illinois."



   (F)   Child falsifying age.  Any person under 18 years of age who
falsely states, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of
18 years, or who presents or offers to any person any evidence of age and
identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of ordering,
obtaining, viewing, or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view
any harmful material, is guilty of a misdemeanor.



   (G)   A person over the age of 18 who fails to exercise reasonable
care in ascertaining the true age of a minor, knowingly distributes to , or
sends, or causes to be sent, or exhibits to, or offers to distribute, or
exhibits any harmful material to a person that he or she believes is a minor
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.  If that person utilized a computer web
camera, cellular telephone, or any other type of device to manufacture the
harmful material, then each offense is a Class 4 felony.



   (H)   Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service
providers, and providers of information services, including, but not limited
to, Internet service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable
under this section, except for willful and wanton misconduct, by virtue of
the transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or
messages of other or by virtue of the provision of other related
telecommunications, commercial mobile service, or information services used
by others in violation of this section.

§ 135.14  TIE-IN SALES OF OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS TO DISTRIBUTORS.



   Any person, firm, or corporation, or any agent, officer, or employee
thereof, engaged in the business of distributing books, magazines,
periodicals, comic books, or other publications to retail dealers, who shall
refuse to furnish to any retail dealer a quantity of books, magazines,
periodicals, comic books, or other publications as the retail dealer normally
sells because the retail dealer refuses to sell, or offer for sale, any
books, magazines, periodicals, comic books, or other publications which are
obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent is guilty of a petty
offense.  Each publication sold or delivered in violation of this chapter
shall constitute a separate petty offense.

IN GENERAL



§ 150.01  TITLE.



   This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the "Building
Code of the City of Palos Heights." 



('69 Code, § 6-1)



§ 150.02  BUILDING PERMIT; WHEN REQUIRED.



   (A)   A permit shall be obtained for the construction, alteration,
or repair of any building, except for minor repairs. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in the International Code Council Inc., 2006
Edition, a permit shall not be required for any minor repairs, as may be
necessary to maintain existing parts of buildings, but such work or
operations shall not involve the replacement or repair of any structural
load-bearing members, nor reduce the means of exit, affect the light or
ventilation, room size requirements, sanitary or fire- resistive
requirements, use of materials not permitted by the building provisions of
this code, nor increase the height, area, or capacity of the building.



   (B)   The application for a permit shall state the date when the
work for which the permit is requested will be completed. The period of time
therein stated must be a reasonable period of time, in the opinion of the
building commissioner. If the building commissioner approves the requested
period of time for completion of the project, he or she will so note on the
application for building permit. If the work for which the permit is
requested is not completed within the time approved, the contractor and the
owner of the property upon which the work is to be performed shall be subject
to a fine of not to exceed $1,000 for each day that the work remains
uncompleted thereafter. Such fine shall constitute a lien upon the real
property upon which the work is to be performed. In addition to the penalty
provided in this section, the unfinished work shall be removed and the
property restored to its condition prior to the commencement of construction
pursuant to building permit. The applicant shall post with the city a bond in
an amount to be determined by the building commissioner, in any event not
less than $500 to assure compliance with this section. The applicant may
request from the building commissioner an extension of the time period within
which the work may be completed. Such request must be made to the building
commissioner prior to the date set forth in the permit application for
completion of the work.



   (C)   Following the issuance of a building permit, all construction
shall be pursued diligently and shall be completed without delay. In the
event construction is not completed within one year following the issuance of
a permit, in addition to any other remedies available to the city to compel
completion in accordance with this Code, an additional permit fee of 10% of
the permit fee previously received from the applicant by the city shall be
due and payable. The City Council, upon the recommendation of the Committee
of Licenses, Permits and Franchises, shall have the power to waive the
increase in fee and to extend the period within which the construction must
be completed upon the permit holder's presentation of proof of extenuating
circumstances which prevent completion of construction.



   (D)   Prior to the initiation of any construction which requires the
issuance of a building permit, any and all contractors are required to verify
the issuance of the required building permit.  In the event a contractor is
found to be working on property requiring a permit for which no valid permit
has been issued, said contractor shall be subject to a fine of $250.

§ 150.03  SUBMISSION OF SUPPORTING MATERIALS.



   In addition to plans, specifications, and other matters required in
connection with applications for building permits, the city council may by
rule require, and all applicants for building permits may, in addition to
material so required, submit supporting memoranda or other documents with the
applications in order to demonstrate that the proposed structure would not
create a violation of any of the provisions of §§ 150.01 through 150.22. 
When, in the opinion of the building official, a building is proposed which
is in violation of § 150.08, the license and permits committee shall examine
the plans and specifications and make its recommendation to approve or deny
the building permit accordingly.



(Ord. O-14-75, passed 2-4-75)



§ 150.04  MINIMUM AREA FOR PERMIT ISSUANCE.



   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
International Code Council Inc., 2006 Edition, no permit will be
granted for the construction of a main structure where the ground floor area,
exclusive of garages, one-story open porches, and breezeways, is less than
1,400 square feet in the case of a one-story structure, or less than 1,000
square feet in the case of a one, one and one- half, two, or two and one-half
story structure.



('69 Code, § 6-3)



§ 150.05  BUILDING PERMIT REVIEW PROCEDURE.



   (A)   The building commissioner for the city, when reviewing
applications for building permits, including the plans and specifications for
the proposed construction, will review all building permit applications to
determine if the proposed construction is consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.



   (B)   The building commissioner shall review all building permit
applications to determine if the site of the proposed construction is
reasonably safe from flooding and to make recommendations for construction in
all locations which have flood hazards.



   (C)   The building commissioner in reviewing all applications of
construction in flood hazard locations within the city shall require that any
proposed construction must:



      (1)   Be designed and anchored to prevent the flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure or portions of the structure
due to flooding.



      (2)   Use of construction materials and utility equipment that
are resistant to flood damage.



      (3)   Use of construction methods and practices that will
minimize flood damage.



      (4)   Provide adequate drainage in order to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.



      (5)   Locate public utilities and facilities, including sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, on the site in such a manner as to be
elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.



   (D)   The city engineer, in reviewing all subdivision applications,
shall make findings of fact and determine if:



      (1)   All proposed developments are consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage.



      (2)   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.



      (3)   Adequate drainage is provided so as not to increase the
exposure to flood hazards of adjacent lands.



      (4)   All public utilities and facilities, including sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, are located, elevated, and constructed so
as to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

§ 150.06  FOUNDATION ELEVATIONS.



   In addition to all other documents and information required herein to
be furnished to the building commissioner when application is made for a
building permit, the applicant shall also furnish a plat of survey, executed
by a licensed surveyor, showing the elevation grade of the foundation for
structures located on properties adjoining the property for which the
application for a permit is requested and, in addition, shall furnish a plat
showing the proposed elevation grade of the foundation of the structure for
which application for a permit is being made.  The building commissioner
shall review the plats and surveys herein provided for, and no permit shall
be issued until the building commissioner has approved the elevation and
grade of the proposed foundation with relation to the foundations of
adjoining structures.

§ 150.07  ARCHITECT, ENGINEER APPROVAL.



   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
International Code Council Inc., 2006 Edition, no plans shall be
approved for a permit unless the plans are signed and sealed either by an

§ 150.09  PURPOSE OF §§ 150.08 THROUGH 150.10.



   It is not the purpose of §§ 150.08 through 150.10 that the control of
architectural character should be so rigidly enforced that individual
initiative is stifled or substantial additional expense incurred.  Good
architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its
purposes, upon the appropriate use of sound materials, and the principles of
harmony and proportion in elements of the buildings.  Good architectural
design is not dependent upon the cost of the structure or upon the particular
style or architecture used.

regulations, the subdivision control regulations, planning regulations, and
zoning ordinances of the city, and shall be enforced by its proper officials
as directed by the mayor and city council.

      (2)   All references to and requirements for fire sprinkler
systems in single family residential properties contained within the
International Residential Code are hereby deleted.



   (C)   The International Building Code, adopted as part of this
section, is hereby amended by inserting the following provisions in place of
the current text:



   BUILDING:  Any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering
any use or occupancy.  For application of this code, each portion of a
building which is completely separated from other portions by fire walls
complying with Section 707.0 shall be considered as a separate building
except when calculating the total area of a building for requiring an
approved fire suppression system.



   313.1.3  SEPARATE BUILDINGS:  Each use shall be considered a separate
building when each such use is completely separated from adjacent uses by
fire walls having a fire resistance rating corresponding to that required by
Table 602.  Each building shall then comply with the provisions of this code
applicable to the use of that building.  For the purpose of figuring the
total area of a building to determine if an approved fire suppression system
is required, fire walls and separation walls will not be considered in
establishing separate buildings or fire areas.



   407.3  BENEATH ROOM OF USE GROUPS R-1, R- 2, 1-1:  Private garages
located beneath rooms in occupancies in Use Group R-1, R-2, or 1-1 shall be
separated from adjacent interior spaces by fire partitions and floor/ceiling
assemblies which are constructed of solid masonry partitions and concrete
floors with not less than a two-hour fire resistance rating.  See Section
501.2.  Attached private garages shall be completely separated from the
interior spaces and the attic area by means of a two-hour fire resistance
rating.  The door opening protectives shall be 1-1/2 hour, Class B fire door
meeting the requirements of Section 717.0.



   501.2.2  EXTERIOR WALLS ALL OTHER USES:  All exterior walls shall be
solid masonry construction or steel column and beam construction with a
veneer of masonry, decorative architectural concrete panels or similar
materials.  The same materials shall be used for all the exterior walls of a
building.  See Section 503.5.



   501.2.3  FLOORS FOR USE GROUPS R-1 AND R-2:  Floors in Use Groups R-1
and R-2 shall be precast or engineered reinforced concrete where separating
tenant spaces.  See Section 503.5.



   501.24  INTERIOR WALLS:  Interior walls totally separating dwelling
units in Use Group R-1 and R-2 shall be solid masonry.



   502.1  AREA, BUILDING:  The area included within the exterior
dimensions of the surrounding exterior walls (or exterior walls and fire
walls) exclusive of courts.  Areas of the building not provided with
surrounding walls shall be included in the building area if such areas are
included within the horizontal projection of the roof or floor above.  For
the purpose of figuring the total area of a building in determining if an
approved fire suppression system is required, fire walls and separation walls
will not be considered in establishing separate building or fire areas.



   EXCEPTIONS:



   1.   Multi-family buildings, Use Group R-2, for fire suppression
systems only.



   2.   Single-family dwellings, Use Group R-3.



   904.1.1  TOTAL AREA:  For purpose of calculating total square feet
(area), the total floor area includes mezzanines and basements contained
within the surrounding exterior walls of the building on all floors and
levels which are added together.  The area included within the surrounding
exterior walls of a building including canopies, when in the opinion of the
code official the canopy creates or may create a hazardous situation, and all
enclosed extensions are also added to the calculation.  Areas of a building
not provided with surrounding walls shall be included within the building
area if such areas are included within the horizontal projection of the roof
or floor above.  Interior walls, including fire walls, and horizontal fire
walls (floors), fire separation walls and party wall, shall not be considered
as walls which divide a structure into two or more separate buildings, but a
structure containing such interior walls shall be considered as one building
for the purpose of this section.



   EXCEPTION:  Fire walls may be utilized to divide a structure of Use
Group R-2 into more than one (1) building.  The total area then shall be
calculated between fire walls for compliance to this chapter.



   904.9  USE GROUP R-2:  An automatic fire suppression system shall be
provided throughout all buildings and/or areas of Use Group R-2 having a
total floor area greater than 10,000 square feet or four (4) more stories in
height.



   904.9.1  USE GROUP R-2 FURNACE ROOMS:  A minimum of one (1) sprinkler
head is required in each furnace room and/or utility room in all multi-
family, multi-story buildings less than 10,000 square feet.  The required
sprinkler head shall be installed in the portable water system without any
branch piping.  A backflow preventor will not be required.



   (D)   The International Residential Code, adopted as part of this
section, is hereby amended by inserting the following provisions in place of
the current text:



   R202  DEFINITION OF HEIGHT, BUILDING:  Height is to be determined by
providing proposed elevations at the four corners corresponding to the
intersection of the front and rear setback lines and the side yard setback
lines.  These elevations are then to be used to develop the average lot
height.  It is from this height that the building height is calculated.



   (E)   Technical standards. Three season rooms, screened in porches,
and like structures shall have a full footing and foundation unless the
addition is under 400 square feet. Any structure under 400 square feet may
utilize a trench footing, 12" wide and 42" depth with 2 #5 rebar top and
bottom.

approved device immediately.  The water customer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner in accordance
with the Illinois Plumbing Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and
all applicable local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made
of such approved devices upon installation and as required by the Illinois
Plumbing Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and local regulations.



   (B)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the city may enter the supply or distribution system of said
municipality, unless such private, auxiliary of emergency water-supply and
the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by
the Director of Water & Sewer and the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency.



   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Director of Water and Sewer to
cause surveys and investigations to be made of commercial, industrial and
other properties served by the public water supply to determine whether
actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist.  Such
surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall
be repeated at least every two years, or as often as the Director of Water
and Sewer shall deem necessary.  Records of such surveys shall be maintained
and available for review for a period of at least five years.



   (D)   The approved cross-connection control device inspector shall

the Director of Water and Sewer or his authorized agent shall have the right
to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the
public water supply or distribution system of the city for the purpose of
verifying information submitted by the customer regarding the required
cross-connection control inspection.  On demand the owner, lessees or
occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the Director of Water
and Sewer any information which he may request regarding the piping system or
systems or water use on such property.  The refusal of such information,
when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Director of Water and

in this section.



   (E)   The Director of Water and Sewer is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains.  Water service
to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been
eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section,
and until a reconnection fee as determined by the Director of Water and Sewer
is paid to the city.  Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be
effected when the Director of Water and Sewer is assured that imminent danger
of harmful contamination of the public water supply system exists.  Such
action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection.  Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be
effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Director
of Water and Sewer of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, such
action is required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution
of the public water supply.  Neither the Public Water Supply, the Director
of Water and Sewer, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer
for any injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from termination of
the customer's water supply in accordance with the terms of this section,
whether or not the termination was with or without notice.

   (A)   Locations.





      (1)   Subject to site plan approval, any such personal
wireless service facilities shall be considered a permitted use if located
either on (1) an existing freestanding tower and/or (2) on city-owned
property pursuant to an agreement with the city and further provided that
such facilities are so designed so as to allow and encourage co-location by
other potential users.  Prior to construction of such facilities, the
petitioner must receive site plan approval from the Plan Commission pursuant
to the site plan review process.

      (2)   If mounted on the roof of an existing building or
structure, the height of an antenna shall not exceed 10 feet above the height
of the existing structure; provided, however, that the maximum height may be
increased if (1) the radio signal would be impaired or blocked off if the
antenna was located near the middle of the roof and (2) the City Council
determines that it is preferable to locate the antenna at a location other
than near the edge of the roof.





      (3)   An antenna attached to the side of a building,
structure, or tower shall not extend above the roof of the building,

      (3)   Personal wireless service facilities attached to a
free-standing tower shall not be located between a principal building and a
street or in the front yard of the lot in question.  Such free-standing
tower shall be located adjacent to the rear wall of the principal building
unless (1) it is shown that an alternate location results in more effective
screening or blending of the tower into the surrounding landscape or (2) the
location has the affect of interfering with the operations of the principal
use on the subject property; provided, however, such personal wireless
service facilities nevertheless may not be located between the principal
building and the street or in the front yard of the lot in question.





   (D)   Screening and Site Location for Personal Wireless Service
Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings or Structures.





      (1)   Personal wireless service facilities may be attached to
the wall or roof of a building subject to height restrictions in division (B)
of this section.  Such facilities shall not be attached to the front wall of
a building unless it can be shown that other locations are not feasible and
that the facilities shall be made to effectively blend into the architecture
of the building.





      (2)   Personal wireless service facilities and their support
structures attached to an existing building or structure shall be of a color
identical to the building or that maximizes the blending of the facilities

      (2)   Landscaping consisting of shrubs and similar materials
shall be provided surrounding the foundation of ground level buildings,
structures, and fences subject to the review and approval of the Building
Commissioner.





      (3)   Ground level buildings and structures shall be designed
and located to blend with the existing architecture and landscaping of the
subject property and the surrounding area.  Masonry facades shall be
required for such buildings or structures unless otherwise allowed as a
condition of the special use approval.





      (4)   Fencing may be provided as a condition of the special
use approval for the purpose of enclosing and screening freestanding towers
or antennas and their support facilities.  Such fencing shall comply with
the requirements for residential fences contained in this subchapter, except

      (2)   All towers and antennas shall comply with the current
standards and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the
Federal Aviation Administration, and any other agency of the federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.





      (3)   Upon application and approval, the Building Commissioner
shall issue a permit prior to construction of any tower or antenna.  Said
permit shall verify that towers and antennas are constructed in compliance
with applicable city building codes and any requirements of the Electronic
Industries Standards and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as
the provisions herein.





   (G)   Co-Location and Location on Existing Structures Preferred. 
In order to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation
of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one provider on existing or
new towers and location of antennas on existing buildings or structures shall
take precedence over the construction of new, freestanding towers.  If a
new, freestanding tower is proposed, special use approval shall not be
granted unless the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following:





      (1)   A diligent effort has been made to locate the antenna on
an existing structure and that due to valid considerations including physical
constraints and economic or technological feasibility, no other appropriate
location is available.





      (2)   Covenants shall be recorded which require that the
applicant allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other providers of
personal wireless service facilities and other antennas to co-locate on the
proposed freestanding tower, where such co-location is technologically
feasible.





      (3)   The site plan for the construction of a new,
freestanding tower shall delineate an area, either on site or on adjacent
property, near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of
additional equipment and buildings for other users.  To the extent that the
site for the new free-standing tower is adequate to allow co-location on such
site, the applicant must allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other
providers to locate on site.





   (H)   Abandonment of Towers or Antennas.  In the event the use of a
tower or antenna is discontinued for a period of 60 consecutive days, the
tower or antenna shall be deemed to be abandoned.  The Building Commissioner
shall determine the date of abandonment based on documentation required from
the tower owner/operator or other appropriate sources.  Upon abandonment,
the tower owner/operator shall have an additional 60 days within which to:





      (1)   Reactivate the use of the tower either by said
owner/operator or transfer of the tower to another owner/operator for such
use within the aforesaid 60-day period.  Transfer of the tower to another
owner/operator shall not require special use approval provided use of the
tower is re-activated within the 60-day period and that the use of the tower
complies with all conditions of the original special use approval and the
terms of this subchapter.





      (2)   Dismantle and remove the tower at which time any special
use shall become null and void.





      (3)   Request approval from the City Council to allow the
abandoned tower or antenna to remain for a specified period of time.  If
said approval is granted the tower shall be reactivated or removed within the
time period approved by the City Council as per the regulations herein.

is completed, excepting only landscaping and/or grading requirement, a
conditional certificate of occupancy may be issued upon receipt of a request
stating:



      (1)   The builder, homeowner, or subcontractor responsible for
grading or landscaping intends to complete the uncompleted work within 30
days (or within 90 days or by June 1, whichever is earlier, if the request is
dated between December 1 and April 1);



      (2)   The builder or homeowner will voluntarily provide, with
the request, a $1,000 cash deposit (or certified check) in exchange for the

within the time limit set based on division (A)(1), the city may, at its sole
option, complete the work or have it completed and refund any remaining money

homeowner's deposit creates no liability for the city to complete any
uncompleted work.



   (C)   Obligation. Builders are under no obligation to participate in
this option of conditional certificate of occupancy. If they prefer, they may
simply complete all work shown on the approved plan and receive a final

anticipated future 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more that 0.1
foot increase in state due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no
more than a 10% increase in velocities. The regulatory floodways are
designated for Navajo Creek on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map prepared
by FEMA and dated July 16, 1980. The regulatory floodways for those parts of
unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the city that may be annexed into the city are designated for Navajo Creek

meets the requirements of this chapter.





      (3)   No development site shall be occupied, no certificate of
occupancy shall be issued, and no subdivision or other development shall be
accepted by the city council unless and until all provisions of this chapter
are met, including the issuance of a final letter of map revision, where
appropriate.





   (B)   The building commissioner and city engineer shall be
responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in § 151.06.





   (C)   To fulfill those duties, the building commissioner and city
engineer first should use the criteria listed in § 151.06 to confirm whether
the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been
determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the building
commissioner and city engineer must determine whether the development site is
within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain
on which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood
fringe, the building commissioner and city engineer shall require that the
minimum requirements of § 151.31 be met. If the site is within a floodway,
the building commissioner and city engineer shall require that the minimum
requirements of § 151.32 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or
floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the
building commissioner and city engineer shall require that the minimum
requirements of § 151.33 be met. The developer shall supply the commissioner
and engineer with evidence substantiating location of development with
regards to floodplain, wetland, and storage requirement. No building permits
will be issued until such time as other required permits have been issued and
received including but not limited to MWRDGC, IEPA, etc. The developer is
responsible for securing the aforementioned permits.





   (D)   In addition, the general requirements of § 151.34 shall be
met for all developments meeting the requirements of §§ 151.31 through
151.33. The building commissioner and city engineer shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of § 151.35.





   (E)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the building
commissioner and city engineer shall review the requirements of § 151.36 to
make sure they are met. In addition, the building commissioner and city
engineer shall complete all notification requirements.





   (F)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as
required in this chapter, the building commissioner and city engineer may
take any and all actions as outlined in § 151.99.

comply with the provisions of this chapter.





      (3)   Improvements, modifications, additions and repairs to an
existing building in the Special Flood Hazard Area shall meet the
requirements of this chapter.





   (H)   Contiguous property.  In order to preclude inappropriate
phasing of developments to circumvent the intent of this chapter, when
proposed development activity will occur on a lot or parcel of land that has
contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned by the same property owner, then
the criteria as defined in this section will be applied to the total land
area complied from aggregate ownership parcels.





   (I)   Other permits.





      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for:

permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for
this type of activity; and





         (b)   Providing copies of the permits, approvals and
letters to the building commissioner, director of public works and city
engineer.





      (2)   The building commissioner and/or city engineer shall not
issue site approvals or permits unless all other federal, state, and local
permits have been obtained.





      (3)   The building commissioner and/or city engineer is
responsible for obtaining and maintaining copies of all other required
federal, state, and local permits.





   (J)   Conditional approval.

shall not be granted until a CLOMR has been granted by FEMA.





      (3)   A conditional approval will be based on conformance with
the performance standards, and the submittal of the appropriate requirements.





      (4)   The letter of conditional approval will state the
conditions placed on the permit applicant. Variation from these conditions is
considered a violation of the provisions of this chapter.





      (5)   Before the issuance of a letter of conditional approval,
the developer shall sign a statement that he or she understands that:

Volume Safety Factor shall be 1.5.





      (3)   The application for a permit to construct an on-stream
detention facility shall provide the city engineer with either an IDNR dam
safety permit or a letter from the IDNR stating that a dam safety permit is
not required.





      (4)   On-stream detention shall not be allowed if:





         (a)   The off-site to on-site tributary drainage area
ratio is greater than 10:1 except for developments providing a watershed
benefit; or





         (b)   The tributary drainage area is greater than 640
acres, except for detention that provides a watershed benefit.





      (5)   The release rate shall be the total of the following:





         (a)   Cubic feet per second per acre of the total
tributary drainage area (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by
impoundment of the on-site two-year storm volume plus the Detention Volume
Safety Factor;





         (b)   0.15 cubic feet per second per acre of the total
tributary drainage area (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by
impoundment of the on-site 100-year storm volume plus the Detention Volume
Safety Factor;





         (c)   The required compensatory storage; and





         (d)   The release rate and on-site detention volume
shall be calculated using the 24-hour storm event. This release rate
calculation shall be used unless other site conditions warrant further
analysis and modification from this standard or unless watershed-specific
release rates have been adopted.





      (6)   On-stream detention shall provide water quality
treatment. One of the following two methods shall be used:





         (a)   A wet detention facility shall be constructed with
a minimum permanent pool volume equal to the calculated sediment volume
accumulated over a one-year period for the entire  upstream watershed and an
average normal water depth of at least four feet. The facility shall also
have a live storage volume that meets the standard storage requirements of
this section; or





         (b)   A separate off-line sediment basin shall be used
with a volume appropriate for the tributary drainage area to the sediment
basin.





      (7)   Impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention
shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require
access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, and shall not cause or
contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat.
Compensatory storage requirements shall be satisfied and shall be in addition
to detention volume requirements.





      (8)   No on-stream detention shall be allowed in areas
designated as a critical wetland.

(Ord. O-14-03, passed 2-18-03)




§ 151.23  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.




   (A)   General principles.





      (1)   Development should be related to the topography and
soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of
steep slopes, where high cut and fills may be required, should be avoided and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.





      (2)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected. 
Clearing of natural ground cover and/or trees within a buffer area as defined
in § 151.24 should be left undisturbed wherever possible.





      (3)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at
any one time.





      (4)   Prior to site clearing and grading, sediment basins or
traps, filter barriers, diversions, and other appropriate control measures
shall be installed and functional.





      (5)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed
and functional as soon as practical during development. Native vegetation is
preferred for developments near, or adjacent to high quality natural areas,
wetlands, and streams.





      (6)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes
to other land uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover
prior to development.





      (7)   All waste generated as a result of site development
shall be properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off
the site by either wind or water.





   (B)   On-site control measures.  The on-site control measures shall
be designed based on the size of the disturbed area as follows:





      (1)   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter
barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control
measures) shall be constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in
referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25
feet may be used as an alternative where runoff in sheet flow is expected.





      (2)   For disturbed areas draining more than one acre, a
sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the
downslope point of the disturbed area in conjunction with other filter
barriers.





      (3)   Sediment basin and trap design shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be for
equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage. Each
shall be sized for the two-year, 24-hour runoff from the site. The release
rate shall be the rate required to achieve a minimum detention time of 10
hours. The outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the wet
detention storage.





      (4)   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the
estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the
construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of
sediment generated in one year. A sediment removal schedule is required for
construction periods exceeding one year.





   (C)   Storm water conveyance channels.  Stormwater conveyance
channels, ditches, swales, and diversions shall convey a 10-year frequency
storm without erosion. All channels shall be stabilized within 48 hours,
consistent with the following standards:





      (1)   For grades up to 4%, seeding in combination with mulch
or erosion blankets shall be placed along the channel sides with sod or
erosion control blanket applied to the bottom.





      (2)   For grades of 4% to 8%, sod shall be used.





      (3)   For grades greater than 8%, use rock or rip-rap, or
reduce the grade using drop structures.





   (D)   Channel protection.





      (1)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width
shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing
channels.





      (2)   Land disturbance activities in stream channels and
construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized.





      (3)   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where
necessary, to minimize erosion. Temporary crossings shall be constructed of
non-erosive materials such as rip-rap or gravel.





      (4)   The temporary stream crossing shall be completely
removed and the stream restored to its pre-construction condition within 48
hours after completion of construction, incorporating appropriate native
vegetation.





   (E)   Additional requirements.





      (1)   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by
sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and
specifications.





      (2)   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations
shall be protected from erosion. Water pumped or otherwise discharged from
the site during construction shall be filtered and a means provided to reduce
erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed
sediment traps, or basins, or equivalent.





      (3)   Each site shall have graveled entrance roads, access
drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or
private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing)
before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment
disposal area.





   (F)   References adopted.





      (1)   Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in
accordance with the Illinois Urban Manual latest edition.





      (2)   Sediment and erosion control planning shall be in
accordance with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control in Illinois (revised July 1988) by the Urban Committee
of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts (the
"Green Book") Chapters 1-5.





      (3)   Where the requirements of §§ 10, 2-10, 5 of this
chapter, the Illinois Urban Manual or the "Green Book" conflict, the more
restrictive requirement shall prevail.





   (G)   Plan requirements.  An erosion and sediment control plan
shall include the following:





      (1)   Proposed sequencing schedule, including dates, for:





         (a)   Stripping;

non-vegetative stabilization measures.





      (4)   Description of dust and traffic control measures and
location and specifications for construction entrances.





      (5)   Locations of stockpiles and description of stabilization
measures.





      (6)   Volumes, locations, and methods of stabilization for

      (7)   Provisions for maintenance of control measures,
including a maintenance schedule.





      (8)   Description of permanent stabilization measures.





      (9)   Identification (name, address and telephone) of the
person(s) or entity responsible for maintenance during and after construction.





   (H)   Extended construction shutdown period.  Disturbed areas shall
be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within 14 calendar days
following the end of active disturbance or re-disturbance. The condition of
the construction site for the winter shut down period shall address proper
sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season. Stabilization
measures include seeding, mulching, sodding or erosion control blankets.





   (I)   Final site stabilization.  All temporary control measures
shall be disposed of within 30 days after permanent soil stabilization
measures have been installed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils
resulting from the temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to
prevent further erosion and sedimentation.

§ 151.24  STREAM AND WETLAND PROTECTION.




   (A)   Buffer areas required.  Buffer areas shall be required along
all streams, lakes, waterways, channels and wetlands, except the following:





      (1)   Roadside ditches;





      (2)   Existing excavated stormwater storage facilities;





      (3)   Borrow pits and quarries;





      (4)   Leveed waterways; and





      (5)   Improvement to existing public roads and utilities.





   (B)   Buffer area dimensions.





      (1)   Linear buffers.  Linear buffers shall be designated
along both sides of all streams and natural channels. A minimum buffer of 30
feet on each side of the channel shall be provided.





      (2)   Water body buffers.  Water body buffers shall encompass
all lakes, wetlands, and other nonlinear bodies of water. A minimum buffer of
30 feet on each side of the channel shall be provided.





      (3)   Exceptional functional value wetlands shall have a
minimum buffer of 100 feet.





      (4)   In areas having state or federal threatened and
endangered species present or for Illinois Natural Inventory Sites, buffer
widths may be modified to meet the terms and conditions specified  during
consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources or United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, pursuant to state and federal laws and
regulations.





      (5)   The buffer area for all Waters of the United States
shall extend from the ordinary highwater mark. The buffer area for wetlands
shall extend from the edge of the delineated wetland. A property may contain
a buffer area that originates from the Waters of the United States on another
property.





      (6)   Buffer-averaging may be allowed by the city engineer,
provided the buffer width is at least half of the buffer width required by
this chapter or the minimum width required by a Corps of Engineers permit,
whichever is wider.





   (C)   Buffer requirements.





      (1)   Features of the stormwater management system may be
within the buffer area of a development.





      (2)   Access through buffer areas shall be provided, when
necessary, for maintenance purposes.





      (3)   Preservation of buffer areas shall be provided by deed
or plat restriction.





   (D)   Allowed uses in buffer areas.





      (1)   All buffer areas shall be maintained free from
development except for the following:





         (a)   Passive recreation, including pedestrian, bicycle
or equestrian trails; and





         (b)   Construction and maintenance of utilities and
stormwater facilities.





      (2)   Structures and impervious surfaces related to
recreational facilities, such as trails and paths, may occupy a maximum of
20% of the buffer surface area, provided the runoff from such facilities is
diverted away from the Waters of the United States or such runoff is directed
to enter the buffer area as unconcentrated flow. Boat docks, boathouses, and
piers shall be allowed and count as a structure when calculating percent of
impervious area.





      (3)   Buffer areas hydrologically disturbed by allowing
construction or as part of a re-vegetation plan shall be re-vegetated using
the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in 
Northeastern Illinois, (NRCS et al.) as a minimum standard.





   (E)   Channel protection.





      (1)   If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, the permit applicant shall demonstrate that:





         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the
activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural
condition of the body of water affected. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat.





         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural
functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no
significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the
replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values.





      (2)   A channel modification shall be designed and constructed
in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:





         (a)   The physical characteristics of the modified
channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in
length, cross-section, slope, and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been
previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should
be incorporated into the channel modification design.





         (b)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be
provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed
such that they will prevent erosion.





         (c)   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used
when feasible. Removal of stream side (riparian) vegetation should be limited
to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and
stabilization effects of the vegetation.





         (d)   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be
limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.





         (e)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side
slope no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bio-engineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are
no practicable alternatives.





         (f)   All disturbed areas associated with the
modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon
completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall
be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of
the vegetation cover.





         (g)   If the existing channel contains considerable
bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features,
such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting
areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be
established, where appropriate.





         (h)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the
downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of
downstream water quality.





         (i)   New or relocated channels should be built in the
dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed
prior to diversion of water to the new channel.





         (j)   There shall be no increase in stage or velocity as
the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.





         (k)   Unless the modification is for a public flood
control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater
storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification.





         (l)   The provisions of §§ 151.23, 151.32, and 151.33
shall also be met.





   (F)   Dumping.





      (1)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental agency
shall dispose of or dump grass clippings, brush, fill, trash, debris, or
other material that may obstruct the flow or storage of water in any channel,
swale, culvert, storm sewer, wetland, storage basin, or other natural or
man-made watercourse or water body.





      (2)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental agency
shall dispose of or dump any petroleum products, chemicals, noxious liquids,
animal waste or other material that will pollute the water in any channel,
swale, culvert, storm sewer, wetland, storage basin, or other natural or
man-made watercourse or water body.

FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS



§ 151.30  BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.



   This chapter's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance
Study for the city. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood
elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection
standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the
Illinois State Water Survey's Flood Plain Information Repository. When a
party disagrees with the best available data, he or she may finance the
detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR and FEMA.



   (A)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHA's of Navajo Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study of the city prepared by FEMA and dated August
19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time.



   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHA's of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the
city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008,
and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.



   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
SFHA delineated as an "MI Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or
depth) delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the city.



   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
of the remaining SFHA's delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the city shall be according to the best existing data available in the
Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository. When no base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined
from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as
HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a
hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in
various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for
estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated
future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local
and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one
square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR for approval; once
approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain
Information Repository for filing. For a non-riverine SFHA, the base flood
elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet, unless
calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State
Water Survey.

§ 151.31  OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.




   (A)   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be
permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other
provisions of this chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely
affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located
within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along
with the requirements of § 151.34.





   (B)   Development permit.





      (1)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not
exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without
first obtaining a development permit from the building commissioner and city
engineer.





      (2)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a
form provided by the building commissioner. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M.S.L.
(1929 adjustment) datum or N.G.V.D. and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all building and
additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on
the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements
of § 151.34.





      (3)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the
building commissioner and city engineer shall compare the elevation of the
site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development
located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood
elevation as of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is
not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate
Map identification.





      (4)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for
disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of
the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion
control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall
also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures,
and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post construction
maintenance.





      (5)   The building commissioner and city engineer shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local,
state, and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letter that may
be required for this type of activity. The building commissioner and city
engineer shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state, and federal
permits have been obtained.





   (C)   Preventing increased damages.





      (1)   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat
to public health and safety.





      (2)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the application shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.





      (3)   Compensatory storage.  Whenever any portion of a
floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied
by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a
hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at
least equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the
existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year
flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely
and openly to the watercourse.

         (e)   A copy of the regulatory floodway map, marked to
reflect any proposed change in the regulatory floodway location.





         (f)   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on
the submitted plan.





      (13)   Any and all other local, state, and federal permits or
approval letters that may be required for this type of development.





      (14)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be
submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the permit criteria of §
151.32.





      (15)   If the regulatory floodway delineation, base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project,
the application will not be considered complete until IDNR has indicated
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway map change. No structures may
be built until a Letter of Map Revision has been approved by FEMA.





      (16)   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and

buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of § 151.34.





   (C)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate
uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will
not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the
natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or
permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction
impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in
this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 III. Adm. Code 708
will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on
stilts, excavation, or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise
nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or
planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as
specifically defined as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are
as follows:





      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams, and other public
works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding,
erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;





      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or
requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment
facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating,
commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;





      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;





      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;





      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions;





      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable
accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that
will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;





      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways,
runways, and taxiways and any modification thereto;





      (8)   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth
of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot)
and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation;





      (9)   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non erosive slope toward a watercourse; and





      (10)   Flood proofing activities to protect previously
existing lawful structures, including the construction of water tight window
wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around
residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside
toe of the floodwall shall be no more than 10 feet away from the exterior
wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial
improvements to the structure.





      (11)   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings,
reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50%
of the market vale of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and
which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.





      (12)   Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do
not increase the building's foot print and are valued at less than 50% of the
market value of the building.





   (D)   Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory
floodway maps designated by IDNR, the construction of an appropriate use will
be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing
with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional
engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of
§ 151.10.





      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase
flood states upstream.  For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert
crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway
conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up
to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective
regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration:





         (a)   Regulatory floodway conveyance





            "K"=1.486AR2/3





                      n





where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, A" is the effective area of the
cross-section, and "R" is the ration of the area to the wetted perimeter.
(See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company,
New York).





         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for
both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement
with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed
conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative
to a non-vegetative land cover.





         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to IDNR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:





            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section
to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's
length.





               a.   When water is flowing from a wide
section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no
faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the
flooded stream's length.





               b.   When expanding or contracting flows in
a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every 10
feet of stream length shall be used.





               c.   Transition sections shall be provided
between cross- sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when
meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties.





               d.   All cross-sections used in the
calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.





      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any
regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of
fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control
projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least the volume of flood plain storage lost. Artificially created storage
lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a ridge shall not be required to
be replaced.





      (3)   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non erosive slope toward a watercourse; and the compensatory
regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water
elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All regulatory floodway storage lost
above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed
to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage
will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the
applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR through a determination of
flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage
is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway
surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification
is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure.





      (4)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to
increase stream erosion or flood heights.  For all appropriate uses, except
bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway
velocities. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream
structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if
scour, erosion, and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of alternative
stabilization measures, soil bio-engineering techniques, natural rock or
rip-rap.





      (5)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and
roadway approaches.  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase
of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls
or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will
increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must
contact IDNR, Dam Safety Section for a Dam Safety permit or waiver.





         (a)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages
must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood
elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
151.30. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart
for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the
U.S. DOT, Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways
calculation procedures.





         (b)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per
§ 151.32.





         (c)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per § 151.32.





         (d)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water
that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of
Transportation permit must be received.





         (e)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by
the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile
must be submitted to IDNR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by §
151.32.





         (f)   All excavations for the construction of the
crossing shall be designed per § 151.32.





      (6)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges,
culverts, and approach roads.





         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach
reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1
foot increase in backwater over the existing flood for all flood frequencies
up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a
source of flood damage.





         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway
approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the
upstream flood plain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility
of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into
consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.





         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the
existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must
be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 92 Ill.
Adm. Code 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted
to the division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.





      (7)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements.  A permit or letter indicating a permit if not required
must be obtained from IDNR, Dam Safety Section from a Dam Safety permit or
waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as
defined in § 151.03 shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm.
Code 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity
invokes a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:





         (a)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public
interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional
stormwater detention;





         (b)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;





         (c)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to
degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should
include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a
pre-sedimentation basin;





         (d)   A non-point source control plan has been
implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment
runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil, and grease, metals,
and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream
watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should
coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed
control; and





         (e)   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of § 151.32.





      (8)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential, and
commercial structures.  If construction is required beyond the outside
dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the
floodproofing, construction shall be placed no further than 10 feet from the
outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not
be required for floodproofing activities.





      (9)   Excavation in the floodway.  When excavation is
proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the
modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures,
or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition
sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:





         (a)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a
wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate
of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length;





         (b)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a
narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's
length; and





         (c)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of
stream length shall be used.





         (d)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland
upstream and downstream of the transition sections.





      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan.  For all activities
located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by
the applicant.





      (11)   Public flood control projects.  For public flood
control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be
considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR through hydraulic and
hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or
cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project
right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the
100-year frequency event.





      (12)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.





         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the
regulatory floodway study, referenced in § 151.30, must be used for analysis
of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or
conditions have changed, IDNR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence
on the appropriate base conditions data to use.





         (b)   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at
the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a
downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed
construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the
100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and
conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.





         (c)   If the applicant learns from the IDNR, local
governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or
culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional
flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed, or
modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be
analyzed and shown to meet the requirements for this section for both the
existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the
bridge, culvert of flood control project is built.





      (13)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision.  If the
appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location
or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR
and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be
issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR a
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by
IDNR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by
FEMA and IDNR. In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with
the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR
approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take
place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA and IDNR.





      (14)   Professional engineer's supervision.  All engineering
analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered
professional engineer.





      (15)   After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway
designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction
that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the
regulatory floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is
received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and
concurrency by IDNR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.





   (E)   State review.  For those projects listed below located in a
regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for
their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit.





      (1)   IDNR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood
profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to § 151.32.





      (2)   IDNR will review an engineer's determination that an
existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the
analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to § 151.32.





      (3)   The IDNR will review three alternative transition
sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to § 151.32.





      (4)   The IDNR will review and approve prior to the start of
construction any department projects, dams (as defined in § 151.03) and all
other state, federal, or local units of government projects, including
projects of the municipality or county.





   (F)   Other permits.  In addition to the other requirements of this
chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit of written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615, Act
5, §§ 5 et seq. No permit from IDNR shall be required if the division has
delegated this responsibility to the city.





   (G)   Dam Safety permits.  Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a dam as defined in § 151.03 per 92 Ill. Adm.
Code 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an Illinois Division
of Water Resources Dam Safety permit prior to the start of construction of a
dam. If the building commissioner or city engineer finds a dam that does not
have an IDNR permit, the building commissioner or city engineer shall
immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of the Division of Water Resources.
If the building commissioner or city engineer finds a dam which is believed
to be in unsafe condition, the building commissioner or city engineer shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, IDNR, Dam Safety Section in
Springfield and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).





   (H)   Activities that do not require a registered professional
engineer's review.  The following activities may be permitted without a
registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet
the other requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.





      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities that:





         (a)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground
elevations; or





         (b)   Do not require the placement of above ground
structures in the floodway; or





         (c)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the
top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the
existing stream bed; and





         (d)   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting
towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as
not to catch debris.





      (2)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:





         (a)   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the
existing adjacent natural bank slope;





         (b)   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation;
and





         (c)   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at
the outfall location.





      (3)   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding
fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.





      (4)   Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:

         (b)   Materials are not placed higher than the existing
top of bank;





         (c)   Materials are place so as not to reduce the cross
sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake; and





         (d)   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes
are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where
high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and
gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.





      (5)   Temporary streams crossings in which:





         (a)   The approach roads will be one-half foot or less
above the natural grade;





         (b)   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass
without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above
any drainage tile or outfall invert;





         (c)   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be
at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel
shall be non-erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel;





         (d)   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or
otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon
removal of construction; and





         (e)   The access road and temporary crossings will be
removed within one year after authorization.

§ 151.33  OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WHERE FLOOD WAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED.




   (A)   In SFHA or floodplains, where no floodways have been
identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been
established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development
shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall
not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters
nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation.





   (B)   Site development permit.  No person, firm, corporation, or
governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development
in a SFHA or flood plain without first obtaining a site development permit
from the building commissioner and city engineer. Application for a
development permit shall be made on a form provided by the building
commissioner and city engineer. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; and
existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation
or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the
location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the
elevation at the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings
subject to the requirements of § 151.34. The application for a site
development permit shall also include the following information:





      (1)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its
purpose, and intended use;





      (2)   Site location (including legal description) of the
property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether
it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;





      (3)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of
activity;





      (4)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which
include as a minimum:





         (a)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity,
name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roadways in the vicinity of
the site, graphic or numerical shale, and north arrow;





         (b)   A plan view of the project and engineering study
reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions
of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adj.) datum or
N.G.V.D., adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when
the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water),
flood plain limit, location and orientation of cross-sections, north arrow,
and a graphical or numerical scale;





         (c)   Cross-section views of the project and engineering
study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal
dimensions of the work as shown in the plan view, existing and proposed
elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation,
100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales
(horizontal and vertical); and





         (d)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for
disturbed areas.  This plan shall include a description of the sequence of
grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to
be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.





      (5)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be
submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of § 151.33.





      (6)   Any and all other local, state, and federal permits or
approvals that may be required for this type of development.





   (C)   Based on the best available existing data according to the
Illinois State Water Survey's Flood Plain Information Repository, the
building commissioner and city engineer shall compare the elevation of the
site to the base flood of 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no
elevation information exist for a site, the developer's engineer shall
calculate the elevation according to § 151.30. Any development located on
land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as
of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the
SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The
building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate
Map identification.





   (D)   The building commissioner and city engineer shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local,
state, and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may
be required for this type of activity. The building commissioner and city
engineer shall not issue the site development permit unless all required
local, state, and federal permits have been obtained.





   (E)   Preventing increased damages.  No development in the SFHA,
where floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to
public health, safety, and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and
hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water
quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by
appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.





   (F)   Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been
determined, the following standards shall apply:





      (1)   The developer shall have a registered professional
engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations,
and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of § 151.32
through (11) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provision of
§ 151.30. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR
for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by
the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets
the requirements of § 151.32 for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall
be defined according to the definition in § 151.03.





      (2)   A development permit shall not be issued unless the
applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR or written documentation that a
permit is not required from IDNR.





      (3)   No permit from IDNR shall be required if the division
has delegated permit responsibility to the city per 92 Ill. Adm. Code, Part
708 for regulatory floodways, per IDNR statewide permit entitled
"Construction in Flood Plains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern
Illinois."





      (4)   Dam Safety permits.  Any work involving the
construction, modification, or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to
impound water as defined in § 151.03 shall obtain an Illinois Division of
Water Resources Dam Safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the building
commissioner and city engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe
condition, the building commissioner and city engineer shall immediately
notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
(IEMA), and the IDNR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield.





      (5)   The following activities may be permitted without a
registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood
elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other

            4.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side
slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.
Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and
gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.





         (d)   Temporary stream crossings in which:





            1.   The approach roads will be one half foot or
less above natural grade;

at or below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of flood waters;





         (h)   The placement of properly anchored buildings not
exceeding 70 square feet in size, not 10 feet in any one dimension (e.g.
animal shelters and tool sheds);





         (i)   The construction of additions to existing
buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which
are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and
which do extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel
to the flow of flood waters;





         (j)   Minor maintenance dredging or a stream channel

is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood and shall be at least
equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case
of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed
to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below
the FPE.





      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells,
sanitary sewer lines, and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted
provided all manholes or other above ground opening located below the FPE are
watertight.





      (3)   Carrying.  For all projects involving channel
modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood
capacity and notification carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained. In addition, the city shall notify adjacent communities in
writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse.





      (4)   Protecting buildings.  All buildings located within a
100-year flood plain also known as a SFHA shall be protected from flood
damage below the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings
located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive
appropriate use standards included in § 151.32. This building protection
criteria applies to the following situations:





         (a)   Construction or placement of a new building.





         (b)   A structural alteration to an existing building
that increases the building's market value by more than 50%. This alteration
shall be figured cumulatively, beginning with any alteration which has taken
place subsequent to April 1, 1990.





         (c)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a
new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection
requirement does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it
lawfully occupied before it was removed  to avoid flood damage; and





         (d)   1.   Installing a travel trailer on a site for
more than 180 days. This building protection requirement may be met by one of
the following methods:





            2.   A residential or non- residential building,
when allowed, may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with
the following:

shall be at or above the flood protection elevation; and





               b.   The fill shall be placed in layers no
greater than one-foot deep before compaction and should extend at least 10
feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood
protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection
elevation. However, the 10-foot minimum may be waived if a structural
engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and
scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage from
or onto neighboring homes.





         (e)   A residential or non-residential building may be
elevated in accordance with the following:





            1.   The building or improvements shall be
elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is
permanently open to flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic
pressure of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent
openings shall be no more than one foot above grade and consist of a minimum
of two openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
below the base flood elevation.





            2.   The foundation and supporting members shall
be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures
so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current,
waves, ice, and floating debris.





            3.   All areas below the flood protection
elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The
lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating,
plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located
at or above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical
and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service
facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation.





            4.   The areas below the flood protection
elevation may only be used for the parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage in an area other than a basement.





         (f)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance
with the Rules and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act
issued pursuant to 77 Ill. Admin. Code 870. In addition, all manufactured
homes shall meet the following elevation requirements.





            1.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in
a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which a manufacture home has incurred substantial
damage from a flood, the top of the lowest floor shall be elevated to or
above the flood protection elevation.





            2.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
the manufactured home shall be elevated so that either the top of the lowest
floor is above the base flood elevation or the chassis is at least 36 inches
in height above grade and supported by reinforced piers or other foundations
of equivalent strength, whichever is less.

            3.   Only a non-residential building may be
structurally floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a registered
professional engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally
dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, and the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design
shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic forces and effect of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or
ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and
without an outside source of electricity. Levees, berms, floodwalls and
similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this
section.

      (2)   The time and place of the hearing.  At such hearing,
the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on his/her
behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of appeals shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.





   (G)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected

PROCEDURE



§ 152.10  COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.



   No grading, building, or construction of any kind relating to the
development of land within the definition of subdivision shall be started
except in accordance with this chapter.  Construction of improvements shall
be in accordance with §§ 152.100 through 152.117.  Construction of
buildings and dwellings shall be started only after issuance of building
permits, and no building permit shall be issued prior to recording of the
final plat. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.1)



§ 152.11  INFORMAL CONSIDERATION.



   While the subdivision plan is still in sketch form, the subdivider may
(and should) consult with the plan commission to determine conformity to the
official plan, including the major street plan, the zoning ordinance, and
compliance with this chapter and with other city ordinances not in conflict
with this chapter.  Within 15 days, the plan commission shall inform the
subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not
meet the objectives of this chapter.  When the plan commission finds that
the plans and data do not meet the objectives of this chapter, it shall
express its reasons therefor.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.2)



§ 152.12  PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.



   Prior to the completion of the final survey of streets and lots of any
subdivision, and before any map of the subdivision is made in a form suitable
for recording, a preliminary layout (general subdivision plan), prepared in
accordance with the regulations set forth herein, shall be submitted to the
plan commission for its review and recommendations.  (Also see §§ 152.120
through 152.125.) In the event a proposed subdivision is one acre or less in
area, the subdivider shall have the right to dispense with the preparation of
the preliminary layout, and to proceed directly with submission of the final
plat.  In such case, the fee provided for in § 152.18 shall be payable upon
submission of the final plat.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.3)



§ 152.13  SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.



   (A)   An application in writing in quadruplicate for the conditional
approval of the subdivision, together with ten prints of the preliminary
layout, shall be filed with the city clerk at least ten days prior to the
regular monthly meeting of the commission, to receive action at the meeting.



   (B)   The plan commission shall determine whether the preliminary
layout is in proper form, and shall not receive or consider the application
as filed until all documents are in accordance with the requirements set
forth herein. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.4)



§ 152.14  CONSIDERATION OF PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.



   The plan commission will study the preliminary layout in connection
with the official plan, the zoning code, and the topography of the area, and
will take into consideration the general requirements of the community, the
particular requirements of the neighborhood, and the best use of the land to
be subdivided.  Particular attention will be given to specific requirements
for parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street
connections, and the suitability of the land for development.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.5)



§ 152.15  ACTION ON PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.



   The plan commission will communicate its conditional approval or its
disapproval, in writing, to the subdivider within 60 days of the time the
application for conditional approval is made, giving, in cases of conditional
approval, the specific changes which it will require in the preliminary
layout, and the character and extent of the required public improvements.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.6)



§ 152.16  CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY LAYOUT.



   Conditional approval of the preliminary layout by the plan commission
does not constitute acceptance of the plat of the proposed subdivision,
acceptance of the proposed improvements, or the final agreement as to
improvement specifications or costs. It is to be considered only as an
approval of general layout design.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.7)



§ 152.17  EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.



   Conditional approval of the preliminary layout shall be effective for a
maximum period of 12 months, except that submission, within this period, of a
final plat applying to a portion of the area covered by the preliminary
layout shall extend the effective period of conditional approval to a maximum
of 24 months from the date of submission of the preliminary layout.  If a
final plat has not been submitted to the plan commission within these time
limits, the preliminary layout shall again be submitted to the plan
commission for conditional approval.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.8)



§ 152.18  FEES.



   (A)   Conditions.  In order to cover the costs of examining the
layout, advertising, holding public hearings, and other expenses incidental
to approval of a subdivision, the subdivider shall pay a fee at the time of
application for the conditional approval of a preliminary layout.  The fee
shall be based on the estimated number of lots created.  At the time of
application for approval of the final plat, the required fee will be
recalculated on the basis of the actual number of lots created, and an
adjustment of the fee will be made.  The subdivider shall pay an additional
amount or shall receive a refund, if the adjusted fee differs from the
original fee.  There will be no refund of any portion of the fee if the
subdivider fails to apply for final approval of the subdivision. If, because
of the failure of the subdivider to submit a final plat within 12 months
after receiving conditional approval of a preliminary plat, it is necessary
to resubmit a preliminary plat for conditional approval, the subdivider shall
be required to pay the fee currently in effect at the time of resubmission.



   (B)   Amount. The fees for approval of a subdivision shall be $500
plus $25 per each newly created lot, and the cost of legal and engineering
fees incurred by the city.



   (C)   Separate charge.  All fees established by this section are in
addition to any sums paid to cover the costs of field inspection of
construction as required under the provisions of § 152.105.



('69Code, App. B, § 4.9) (Amend. Ord. O-12-07, passed 3-6-07)



§ 152.19  SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT.



   After approval of the preliminary layout by the plan commission, and
fulfillment of the required conditions, the subdivider shall apply in writing
to the chairman of the plan commission for approval of a final plat
(subdivision) plan.  The final plat shall conform substantially to the
preliminary layout given conditional approval.  The application shall be in
duplicate and shall be accompanied by the original inked plat on tracing
cloth or vellum, one reproducible and ten prints. Specifications for the plat
and for other documents to accompany the application are given in §§
152.120 through 152.125 of this chapter.  The final plat will not be
considered as submitted unless in agreement with specifications and
accompanied by the required documents. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.10)



§ 152.20  HEARING.



   The chairman of the plan commission will notify the subdivider or his
or her representative of the time and place at which he or she will be heard
on behalf of his or her application.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.11)



§ 152.21  ACTION ON FINAL PLAT.



   The plan commission will communicate in writing to the subdivider its
disapproval together with the reasons therefor, or notice of its
recommendation for approval, of the final plat, within 60 days after the date
on which the application for approval is made. If the plan commission
approves the final plat, the approval will be entered upon the tracings by
the signature of the chairman. The tracings shall then be transmitted to the
city council by the plan commission with the recommendation for council
approval.  Upon approval by council action, the tracing shall be signed by
the mayor and the city clerk, and affixed with the city seal.  Approval by
the council shall be by resolution setting forth all conditions upon which
approval is predicated.  The original tracing shall be recorded with the
appropriate officials of Cook County and, after recording a certified copy
and a signed reproducible, shall be returned to the city and filed by the
clerk. Appropriate notifications shall be given to the plan commission and
the subdivider, advising of council approval or disapproval. If the plat is
disapproved, the tracings are to be returned to the plan commission with a
statement of reasons.



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.12)



§ 152.22  EFFECTIVENESS OF FINAL APPROVAL.



   Approval of the final plat by the plan commission and the city council
shall be null and void if the plat is not acceptable for recording in the
office of the recorder of deeds of the county. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 4.13)



GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ACCEPTABILITY



§ 152.30  CONFORMANCE TO OFFICIAL PLAN.



   The subdivision shall conform to the official plan or the existing
portions thereof, and shall not encroach upon areas designated in the
official plan for future public facilities. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.1)



§ 152.31  PROVISION FOR FUTURE SUBDIVISION.



   If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building
lots, the parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets
and logical further subdivisions. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.2)



§ 152.32  RESERVE STRIPS PROHIBITED.



   There shall be no reservation of strips of land that prevent or limit
access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.3)



§ 152.33  BUFFER PLANTING STRIPS AND FENCES.



   Where a residential subdivision adjoins a railroad right-of-way, a
waterway, an industrial area, a business area, or other land use which would
have a depreciating effect on the residential use of the property, a buffer
planting strip 10 to 15 feet in width and suitably planted to form a screen
or fence may be required by the plan commission. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.4)



§ 152.34  BUILDING SITES.



   (A)   Every lot must contain a suitable building site and be able to
conform to the requirements of the building and zoning code for the erection
and location of building structures.



   (B)   No land will be approved for subdivision which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities. 
However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the
opinion of the city engineer, make the area completely safe for residential
occupancy and provide adequate drainage, the preliminary plan for subdivision
may be approved. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.5)



§ 152.35  TREES.



   (A)   Valuable large trees shall be preserved whenever possible. 
Where planting strips are provided with trees, the trees shall not be of a
low bushy species that might obstruct vision.  Trees or shrubs within a
40-foot radius from intersecting property lines at a street intersection
shall not have branches closer to the ground than 8 feet.



   (B)   Street trees having a trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above
the ground) of not less than 2 inches shall be planted along all streets
where trees do not exist, no more than 40 feet apart.  This requirement will
be satisfied, and it is preferable, if an equivalent number of trees of the
same size are planted in a naturalistic way in the front yards of the
abutting lots.  Only oak, honey locust, sycamore, Norway maple, ginkgo,
little leaf linden, or other long-lived shade trees, acceptable to the plan
commission, shall be planted. 



   (C)   All Oak, Honey, Locust, Sycamore, Norway Maple, Ginkgo, Little
Leaf Linden or other long-lived shade trees six inches or more in diameter,
outside the proposed buildable area, on site and in the public right-of-way
adjacent to the site, shall be protected from unreasonable damage by the use
of acceptable tree protection measures in accordance with a manner approved
by the Building Commissioner. Such protection shall remain in place during
construction, and removed as authorized by the Building Commissioner at the
completion of the construction.



   (D)   All trees on property adjacent to the site that are within ten
feet of a property line shared with the site, or that have a critical root
zone extending into the site, shall be protected from unreasonable damage by
the use of acceptable tree protection measures approved by the Building
Commissioner.



   (E)   For purposes of this section, acceptable tree protection
measures are those measures designed and implemented to reasonably limit the
damage to trees while enabling lawful construction activity consistent with
best construction practices as determined by the city. Acceptable tree
protection measures include:



      (1)   The installation of tree protection fencing along the
perimeter of the critical root zone located within construction site, which
shall remain in place during construction and removed only when construction
is complete or as authorized by the Building Commissioner. The fencing shall
be wood slat fencing, or such other fencing as approved by the Building
Commissioner. The proposed location of tree protection fencing shall be shown
on the demolition plan, redevelopment plan, or lot improvement plan. Tree
protection fencing shall be placed along the perimeter of the critical root
zone of each tree to the extent practical. Such fencing shall be contained
within the limits of the site and within the limits of the adjacent public
parkway. Such fencing shall not encroach on the public streets or sidewalks.



      (2)   Tree protection measures recommended by a professional
arborist and approved by the Building Commissioner to reasonably involve the
least amount of damage to trees.



('69 Code,App. B,§ 5.6)  (Amend. Ord. O-19-05, passed 5-17-05)



§ 152.36  NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN.



   If a suggested plan for the neighborhood or area in which the tract to
be subdivided is located has been made by the plan commission, the street
layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformance thereto. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 5.7)



§ 152.37  VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   Variations and exceptions from the design and dimensional
standards and improvement requirements of this chapter may be made by the
plan commission in cases where, owing to exceptional conditions, there are
extreme difficulties or hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of this chapter.  Resubdivision of a single lot of a platted block of
an old subdivision shall be considered as an exceptional condition meriting
departure from the strict letter of this chapter.  No variation or exception
shall be made that will be detrimental to the public welfare or that will
affect adversely the official plan.



   (B)   In no case shall a residential resubdivision of a lot or lots
be granted if one or more of the following conditions exist:



      (1)   The resubdivision will result in one or more lots less
than 11,000 square feet in area.  This section shall only apply to lots
which are subdivided after April 21, 1987, and shall not apply to existing
lots.



      (2)   The resubdivision will result in the creation of a side
yard or rear yard violation.



      (3)   The resubdivision will tend to damage or change the
nature or character, or be a detriment to the nature and character, of an
existing subdivision.

STREETS



§ 152.40  MAJOR STREETS.



   Wherever a subdivision embraces a major street, as shown on the major
street plan, the major street shall be platted in the location and of the
width indicated on the major street plan. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.1)



§ 152.41  SECONDARY STREETS.



   Secondary streets shall be included when it is apparent that sufficient
traffic will flow from the minor streets within the subdivision and that the
traffic will need to be channeled in control of the number of access points
to the major street.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.2)



§ 152.42  STREET LAYOUT.



   The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous
development of the entire neighborhood area.  Where necessary to the
neighborhood pattern, existing principal streets in adjoining subdivisions
shall be continued, and shall be at least as wide as existing streets and in
alignment with them. The street layout shall provide for the future
projection of the principal streets into unsubdivided lands adjoining.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.3)



§ 152.43  MINOR STREETS.



   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.4)



§ 152.44  RESERVE STRIPS.



   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except
where their control is definitely placed in the city under conditions
approved by the plan commission.

§ 152.46  INTERSECTIONS.



   There shall be a minimum number of intersections of minor streets with
major streets. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.7)



§ 152.47  MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS.



   Where a subdivision has frontage on a major street, as shown on the
major street plan, or on a superhighway or other high volume trafficway, and
where it is not feasible to have the lots back to such high volume streets,
provision shall be made for marginal access streets.  These marginal access
streets shall be approximately parallel to and on each side of the major
street right-of-way and separated from the right-of-way by a strip of land at
least 10 feet wide.  Separation strips may be provided with screen planting,
but such planting shall be so placed that it does not obstruct vision at
intersections.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.8)



§ 152.48  STREETS FOR USES ADJACENT TO RAILROADS, WATERWAYS, OR MAJOR
STREETS.



   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way,
waterway, or major street, the plan commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way, waterway, or
major street, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land.  The distance shall be determined with due regard also for
the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.9)



§ 152.49  STREETS AT BUSINESS CENTERS.



   In front of areas zoned or designed for commercial use, the street
width and the roadway width shall be increased on the side or sides on which
the property for commercial use is located by a merging lane at least 15 feet
wide.  This is to insure the free flow of traffic without interference by
vehicles entering or leaving parking areas.  This is not a parking space
requirement and shall in no way affect or diminish requirement by the zoning
code or otherwise for off-street parking facilities; neither shall
fulfillment of this requirement and its acceptance by the plan commission be
deemed an approval or endorsement of any change in zoning necessary for
commercial use.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.10)



§ 152.50  ALLEYS.



   Paved rear alleys not less than 20 feet wide will be required in all
business and industrial districts of subdivisions, except where special
conditions make alleys impracticable; in such cases, adequate off-street
loading space, suitably surfaced, shall be provided.  Dead-end alleys will
not be approved for residential districts of subdivisions. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.11)



§ 152.51  HALF-STREETS.



   (A)   Whenever a subdivision is proposed to be located adjacent to
unsubdivided lands, a half-street shall be platted and constructed within the
proposed subdivision at its boundary with the unsubdivided lands.



   (B)   Whenever there is an existing half-street adjacent to a tract
proposed to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted
within the tract proposed to be subdivided so as to form a full width street
at the boundary of the two adjacent subdivisions.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.12; amend. Ord. O-18-81, passed 8-4-81)



§ 152.52  STREET GRADES.



   Unless otherwise approved by the plan commission, street grades shall
conform in general to the terrain and shall be not less than 0.35% nor more
than 5%.  Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface drainage
of storm water regardless of the presence or absence of storm sewers.  The
intent is to avoid depressions or inverts that will flood  in flash storms,
or for which storm sewers are inadequate.



('69 Code, App. B, § 6.13)



§ 152.53  CUL-DE-SACS.



   Cul-de-sacs shall normally not exceed 400 feet in length and shall have

report stating the progress of the work, and giving his findings as to the
quality and quantity of materials used, and the quality of methods and
workmanship.  He shall in particular call attention to any circumstances
that entail departures from the working drawings and specifications, such as
unforeseen difficulties of drainage, ground  water, poor subsoil, unstable
fill material, unconventional or faulty practices of the contractors, or
other circumstances. Whenever, in his opinion, the departures are likely to
cause either a lower ultimate standard of performance, or a higher
maintenance cost, than could reasonably be anticipated, he shall immediately
notify the city engineer.  When an improvement has been completed, he shall
prepare a summary report.



('69 Code, App. B, § 10.9)



§ 152.109  SUBDIVIDER RESPONSIBLE.

combination of 2 or more, of 3 methods.



   (A)   The subdivider may post a performance bond prepared in a form
approved by the city attorney, and underwritten by a surety company listed as
approved by the city council.  The amount of the bond shall be not less than
125% of the final estimate of the cost of the improvement as estimated by the
city engineer.  There shall be no reduction in the amount of that portion of
the bond applying to a particular improvement unless and until that
improvement is complete and accepted or approved by the city council. From
the standpoint of acceptance, the subgrade, base course, and surface course
of a street, alley, or parking area shall be considered as a single
improvement.



   (B)   The subdivider may deposit a cash bond with the city in
accordance with a specific escrow agreement approved by the city attorney and
the city engineer and in an amount not less than 125% of the final estimate
of the cost of the improvements as estimated by the city engineer.  The
deposit shall be held in a special account by the city, and the agreement may
provide for partial payouts, as work progresses, in amounts approved by the
city engineer as corresponding to the original estimate of unit costs. 
Partial payouts shall be contingent upon favorable inspection reports, and
the sum of the partial payouts for a single improvement shall not exceed 90%
of the original deposit for the improvement, until and unless the improvement
is complete and accepted or approved by the city council. From the standpoint
of acceptance, the subgrade, base course, and surface course of a street,
alley, or parking area shall be considered a single improvement.



   (C)   Upon specific permission of the city council, as recommended
by the plan commission, the subdivider may elect to complete one or more
improvements prior to approval of the final plat.  Where the subdivider
elects to guarantee completion of an improvement by this method, approval of
the final plat shall be contingent upon certification by the city engineer
that the improvement has been completed in accordance with drawings and
specifications, and that the inspection reports are favorable. 



('69 Code, App. B, § 10.13)



§ 152.113  MAINTENANCE BOND.



   The subdivider shall furnish the city a maintenance bond in the amount
of 15% of the final contract price to insure the maintenance of the
improvements furnished by the subdivider.  The bond shall be valid for a
period of 15 months commencing with the date of acceptance of the improvement
by the city, and shall be in a form, and underwritten by a surety company,
approved by the city attorney and the city council.



('69 Code, App. B, § 10.14)



§ 152.114  ACCEPTANCE.

Recommendation shall be contingent upon:



   (A)   Fulfillment of the requirements of § 152.113.



   (B)   An opinion by the city attorney that satisfactory and proper
conveyances and dedications have been made by the subdivider to the city.



   (C)   Improvements being complete and in good repair in accordance
with city standards and requirements.



   (D)   Inspection reports indicating compliance with working drawings
and specifications.



   (E)   A single improvement shall not be accepted in part; it shall
be complete throughout the subdivision as indicated in the final plat and
working drawings.  The subgrade, base course, and surface course of a
street, alley, or parking area shall be considered as a single improvement.



   (F)   Acceptance of an improvement shall constitute release of the
applicable portion of the performance bond or of the applicable portion of
the balance of the cash deposit covering construction of improvements.

§ 152.115  FEES, BONDS.



   To defray the engineering and inspection expenses incurred by the city
in checking preliminary and final cost estimates, working drawings,
specifications, and the final plat, and in executing inspection
responsibilities, the subdivider shall be required to reimburse the city as
follows.  These are separate and distinct charges from the fee paid at the
time of submission of the preliminary layout.



   (A)   The subdivider shall apply in writing to the city engineer,
making a request that the working drawings, specifications, and estimates for
improvements be checked.  The application shall be accompanied by 2 sets of
construction prints, specifications, and estimates.  The city engineer shall
inform the subdivider of the amount of the charge for this service, and the
charge shall be based upon practices recommended by the Schedule of
Recommended Fees for Engineering Services, published by the Illinois Society
of Professional Engineers.  Checking shall proceed after the subdivider has
paid over this fee to the city clerk.  Additional fees shall be paid for the
rechecking of drawings, specifications, and estimates, arising from revisions
made by or required of the subdivider.  There shall be no refund of
engineering fees if the project is abandoned for any reason whatsoever.



   (B)   The engineering fee is intended to include the preparation or
checking of preliminary and final cost estimates, working drawings,
specifications, and staking, but is not intended to include inspection.



   (C)   Before the grading or construction of improvements is started,
the subdivider or his contractor shall post with the city clerk a cash
inspection bond in an amount agreed upon between the city engineer and the
subdivider or contractor as being sufficient to provide for inspection
charges at the current per diem rates.  Any excess of the bond over total
inspection charges will be refunded to the depositor, and any overdraft on
the bond shall be provided for immediately by the contractor, to ensure
continuity of inspection.  Payments to the city engineer for inspection
services shall be made monthly in accordance with progress of the work.



   (D)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or contractor
to notify the city engineer in advance as to the dates that construction work
will commence and complete for purposes of determining the number  of days
of the inspection charge.  In the event of a dispute, only notification in
writing shall be considered as proof of notice.



   (E)   Per diem inspection rates shall be equal to 100% of the

§ 152.116  PROTECTION AND REPAIR OF EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.



   The subdivider or his contractors and suppliers shall be responsible
that existing improvements and the property of the city are not damaged, or
rendered less useful, or unsightly, by the operations of the subdivider or
his contractors and suppliers. This provision is intended to include damage
or nuisance with respect to the land, improvements, or landscaping of the
city; damage to existing streets, sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, or parkways,
by passage thereover of equipment or trucks, or by excavation, for any
purpose; the spillage or tracking of earth, sand, rock, or other material
onto existing streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, or parkways; the washing
by storm water of earth or sand onto streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or
parkways or into catchbasins; damage to water mains, sanitary sewers,
culverts, or storm sewers. To reduce or localize the possibility of damage to
streets by heavy trucking, the city engineer shall instruct the subdivider as
to the streets to be used for access to the subdivision by equipment and
trucks, and the subdivider shall be responsible for enforcement of this
instruction upon his contractors and their suppliers.  The subdivider shall
make provisions to prevent washing of earth or sand onto sidewalks, streets,
or curbs and gutters, and into catchbasins by storm water.  Where deemed
advisable, the city engineer shall have the power to require, either prior to
the commencement of construction or after construction is in process, that
the subdivider post a surety to guarantee the repair of damages or abatement
of nuisance. Where the need for surety becomes apparent after the
construction is in process, the city engineer shall have the power to order
the construction discontinued until a surety has been posted.  Expenses
incurred by the city in repairing damages, and cleaning streets, catchbasins,
and sewers, shall be deducted from the surety.

§ 153.04  HOME OCCUPATIONS.



   The city is not opposed to a home occupation which is incidental to the
primary use of a home as a dwelling and does not infringe upon the health,
welfare, and right to quiet enjoyment of nearby home owners.  An occupation

occupation conforms at all times to all of the following criteria and
conditions:

use of the dwelling unit for dwelling purposes.

that will indicate from the exterior that the building is being used, in
part, for any purpose other than a dwelling.

merchandise.  Such merchandise shall be limited to specialty goods and
services only.

interference, or vibration emanating from the structure in which the home
occupation functions.



   (F)   No mechanical or electrical equipment shall be used except
typewriters, calculators, small copy machines, and a computer no larger than
mini.



   (G)   No hazardous materials shall be stored, as defined by the
National Fire Protection Association's current revision.



   (H)   No traffic shall be generated by the home occupation in
greater volumes than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood.



   (I)   Home occupations in all residential districts shall be
considered as special privileges within that district and shall be revocable
when the home occupations impinge upon the rights and privileges of the
residential district in which they take place by violating all above criteria.



   (J)   No persons shall be employed on the premises except persons
who are permanent legal residents of the premises.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 153.10  INTERPRETATION.

this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare.



   (B)   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter
upon the use of land or buildings are either more restrictive or less
restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this
chapter or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of
any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive, or which impose higher
standards or requirements, shall govern.  The most recently passed ordinance
shall prevail.



   (C)   This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement,
covenant, or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations
of this chapter are more restrictive, or impose higher standards or
requirements than easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the
requirements of this chapter shall govern.



   (D)   No building, structure, or use which was not lawfully existing
at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall become or be made lawful
solely by reason of the adoption of this chapter; and to the extent that, and
in the manner that, the unlawful building, structure, or use is in conflict
with the requirements of this chapter, the building, structure, or use
remains unlawful hereunder.

PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT




§ 153.100  INTENT.




   Ingenuity, imagination, and design efforts on the part of builders,
architects, site planners, and developers can produce residential
developments which are in keeping with overall land use intensity and open
space objectives of the master plan while departing from the strict
application of use, setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements of
several zones.  The intent of this section is to permit such flexibility and
provide performance criteria for planned residential development which:
permit a creative approach to the development of residential land; accomplish
a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict
application of minimum requirements of the zoning code and subdivision code;
provide for an efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of
utilities and streets, and thereby lower housing costs; enhance the
appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural features, the
provision of underground utilities where feasible, and the provision of
recreation areas and open space in excess of existing zoning and subdivision
requirements; provide an opportunity for new approaches to living
environment; and provide an environment of stable character compatible with
surrounding residential areas.




(Ord. O-17-70, passed 7-7-70)





§ 153.101  VOLUNTARY ALTERNATE PROCEDURE.




   (A)   The use of the planned residential development procedures
contained herein is not mandatory for the development of any parcel of ground.



   (B)   The intent and purpose of this process is to provide a
voluntary alternate procedure which maximizes the utilization of land
primarily for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the future residents of that
area and the existing residents of the city. In a planned residential
development, open space and common recreational areas and facilities are the
environment, and livability benefits are furnished to the residents and
community in lieu of large individual lots.




(Ord. O-17-70, passed 7-7-70)





§ 153.102  PERMITTED USE.




   Pursuant to ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-12-4 et seq., and subject to the
regulations, standards, and conditions set forth herein, planned residential
developments shall be permitted in the city upon obtaining a special
exception from the plan commission and the city council.  A special
exception certification for a development or part thereof may be issued only
after:



   (A)   Final subdivision approval thereof by the plan commission.



   (B)   Approval by city council.



   (C)   Filing the approved plan in the office of the Cook County
Recorder.

§ 153.104  PRINCIPLES OF PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.




   The Planned Residential Development is a permitted use designed to
provide for small and large-scale developments, incorporating a single type
or a variety of residential and related uses which are planned and developed
as a unit.  The development may consist of individual lots or common
building sites. Common land must be an essential and important element of the
plan related to effecting the long-term value of the entire development.




(Ord. O-17-70, passed 7-7-70; amend. Ord. O-23-73, passed 4-24-73)





§ 153.105  STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.





   Subject to the provisions set forth herein, Planned Residential
Developments are permitted uses on a site consisting of no less than 2
contiguous acres.





(Ord. O-17-70, passed 7-7-70; amend. Ord. O-23-73, passed 4-24-73)





§ 153.106  USES AND REQUIREMENTS.




   (A)   Residential uses.  Permitted land use requirements of the
zone within which a Planned Residential Development is located shall apply
with the following exceptions:



      (1)   Open space reservations may be considered for population
density and building intensity increases.



      (2)   Permitted types of dwelling units may include
single-family detached homes, town houses, garden apartments, or high-rise
apartments.



      (3)   Condominium, cooperative individual, municipal, or any
other type of ownership is hereby permitted.



   (B)   Non-residential uses.  Non-residential uses, limited to those
permitted by the plan commission, are permitted in a development, provided
that the uses are primarily for the service and convenience of the residents
of the development, and further provided that:



      (1)   No store shall exceed 5,000 square feet of gross floor
area.



      (2)   The total mercantile and office space permitted within a
planned residential development shall not exceed 40 square feet of gross
floor area under roof per dwelling unit in the development, excluding in the
computation buildings used for educational, recreational, or cultural
purposes.



   (C)   Minimum requirements:



      (1)   Yard, setback, lot size, type of dwelling unit, height,
frontage requirements, and use restrictions are waived for the development;
provided, that the spirit and intent of this section are complied with in the
total development plan, as determined by the plan commission.  The plan
commission may, with the approval of the city council, determine that certain
setbacks be required within all or a portion of the perimeter of the site,
and shall exercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total development
plan does comply with the spirit and intent of this section.  The final
authority for the enforcement of the development shall rest with the city
council.



      (2)   Every dwelling unit shall have access to a public
street, walkway, or other area dedicated to common use.



      (3)   The approximate location of structures, shown on the
conceptual development plan, shall be so arranged as not to be detrimental to
existing or other proposed structures or to the development of the
neighborhood.



   (D)   Privacy.  Each development shall provide reasonable visual
and acoustical privacy for dwelling units.  Fences, insulation, walks,
barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection
and aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants,
screening of objectionable views or uses, and reduction of noise.  High-rise
buildings shall be located within a development in such a way as to dissipate
any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings and shall not invade the
privacy of the occupants of such low-rise buildings.



   (E)   Off-street parking.  Parking convenient to all dwelling units
and other uses shall be provided pursuant to the minimum requirements of §
153.16 of this code.  In addition to all provisions of § 153.16, not less
than one parking space for each unit shall be completely enclosed.  Where
appropriate, common driveways, parking areas, walks, and steps shall be
provided, maintained, and lighted for night use. Screening of parking and
service areas may be required, through ample use of trees, shrubs, hedges,
and screening walls.



   (F)   Perimeter requirements.  If topographical or other barriers
within 200 feet of the perimeter of the development do not provide reasonable
privacy for existing uses adjacent to the development, the plan commission
shall impose either of the following requirements, or both:



      (1)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development
must be set back in accordance with the provisions of the zoning code
controlling the area within which the development is situated.



      (2)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development
must be well screened in a manner which is approved by the commission.



   (G)   Interior streets.  The minimum roadway width of interior
one-way streets with parking permitted on one side shall be 24 feet.  The
minimum roadway width of two-way streets with parking permitted shall be 35
feet.  The streets shall be paved according to city specifications for
residential streets, maintained in good condition, and lighted at night.



   (H)   Sidewalks.  Sidewalks shall be provided as deemed necessary
by the plan commission.



   (I)   Swimming pools.  All swimming pools within a development
shall comply with the applicable provisions of the city zoning code.

Ord. O-29-74, passed 8-24-74)



   (J)   Landscaping.  Landscaping of green areas is to be shown on
site plans and renderings.  It is expected that all trees, shrubs and
landscaping shown and approved will be developed, for example, if 100-year
old pine trees are shown in artist's renderings, the developer must plant
100-year old pine trees.  All grass (whether seeded or sodded), trees, and
shrubs must be guaranteed for one year from the last planting.



      (1)   In addition to landscape drawings for the site plan, a
"typical" drawing for each type of dwelling unit is required.  Also, a plant
list for the site plan and the "typical" drawings must contain the names
(common and botanical) of the plants, the sizes of the plants to be planted,
the quantities of each species, and the spacing of plants.



      (2)   A landscape buffer is required between a Planned
Residential Development Zoning district and an adjacent zoning district. 
The buffer should consist of heavy screening or a landscaped berm.  Where
used, the berm length and height and the surrounding terrain elevation must
be indicated.



      (3)   A total cost estimate of landscaping for the project
must be given in January 1 dollars for the current year. Twenty percent of
the total landscaping costs should be deposited in escrow with the city
before building permits are granted.  A minimum of 20% of the last
expenditure for landscaping will be held in escrow for a period of one year
past the time of planting and will be refunded upon approval of the city of
the last planting.



      (4)   Trees are to be planted in street parkways, common open
areas, and adjacent to building areas.



      (5)   All plans, renderings and exhibits presented before the
boards in connection with the development become the property of the city and
are not returned to the developer, but maintained in the city's files and
will be made a part of the ordinance for the development.  The developer may
be required to reduce the above to file cabinet size at the request of the
city.

§ 153.107  DENSITY.





   Density (dwelling units per acre) may be increased if the character of
the development or amenities incorporated in the development warrant the
increases; provided, that in no case shall the density increase cause the
density of the Planned Residential Development to be more than 7 units per
acre. The plan commission, with the approval of the city council, shall
determine the density which may be constructed within the development by
dividing the gross project area by the required lot area per dwelling unit
which is required in the zone in which the development is located; or the
required lot area per dwelling unit which is required in the zone in which
the development is located, and modified by any increases in density
permitted under division (B) of this section.





   (A)   Planned Residential Development in more than one zone.  If
the development is in more than one zone, the number of allowable dwelling
units must be separately calculated for each portion of the planned
development that is in a separate zone, and must then be combined to
determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire development.





   (B)   Density increases.  Density increases shall be governed by
the precepts listed below, which are to be treated as additive and not
compounded:





      (1)   Open space reservation shall be considered for density
increases according to the following provisions:





         (a)    For unimproved common open space:





            1.   Maximum increase of 2% for the first acre of
open space per each 20 acres gross of the development.





            2.   Maximum increase of 3% for the second acre of
open space per each 20 acres gross of development.





            3.   Maximum increase of 5% for each additional
open space per each 20 acres gross acre of development for the total
development.





         (b)    For improved common open space:





            1.   Maximum increase of 2% for the first acre of
improved open space per each 20 acres gross of development.





            2.   Maximum increase of 4% for the second acre of
improved open space per each 20 acres gross of development.





            3.   Maximum increase of 6% for each additional
acre of improved open space per each 20 acres gross of development for the
total development.





      (2)   Character, identity, and architectural and siting
variation incorporated in a development shall be considered cause for density
increases not to exceed 15%, provided that these factors make a substantial
contribution to the objectives of a development.  The degree of
distinctiveness and the desirable variation achieved shall govern the amount
of density increase which the plan commission may approve.  Such variations
may include, but are not limited to, the following:





         (a)   Landscaping (a maximum increase of 10%):
streetscape; open spaces and plazas; use of existing landscape; pedestrian
way treatment; and recreational areas.





         (b)   Design features (a maximum increase of 5%): street
sections; architectural styles; harmonious use of materials; parking areas
broken by landscape features; and varied use of house types.





   (C)   When density increase is not permitted.  If the plan
commission finds that any of the following conditions would be created by an
increase in density permitted in division (B), it may either deny any
application for an increase in density, or limit the increase in density by
an amount sufficient to avoid the creation of any of the following conditions:





      (1)   Inconvenient or unsafe access to the development.





      (2)   Traffic congestion in streets adjoining the development.





      (3)   An excessive burden imposed on parks, recreational
areas, schools, and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to
serve the development.

§ 153.108  OPEN SPACES.




   (A)   COMMON OPEN SPACE is defined as a parcel or parcels of land,
an area of water, or a combination of land and water, designed and intended
for the use or enjoyment of residents of the Planned Residential Development,
or of the general public. Common open spaces may contain accessory structures
and improvements necessary or desirable for noncommercial, recreational, or
cultural uses.  A variety of open space and recreational areas is
encouraged, such as children's informal play areas in close proximity to
individual dwelling units, according to the concentration of dwellings;
formal parks; picnic areas; playgrounds; and scenic open areas and communal
noncommercial recreational facilities.





   (B)   Conveyance and maintenance of common open space:  All common
open space, shown on the final development plan and recorded in the office of
the city clerk, must be conveyed in accordance with one of the methods listed
below.  In any event, the developer must file in the county land records, at
the time the approved final subdivision map is filed, legal documents which
will produce the aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, will provide a
method for restricting the use of common open spaces for the designated
purposes.





      (1)   By dedication to the city as municipally owned and
maintained as common open space.





      (2)   By leasing or conveying title (including beneficial
ownership) to a corporation, association, or other legal entity.  The terms
of the lease or other instrument of conveyance must include provisions,
suitable to the plan commission, with approval of city council, for
guaranteeing:





         (a)   The continued use of the land for the intended
purposes.





         (b)   Continuity of proper maintenance for those
portions of the open space land requiring maintenance.





         (c)   When appropriate, the availability of funds
required for maintenance.





         (d)    Adequate insurance protection.





         (e)   Recovery for loss sustained by casualty,
condemnation, or otherwise.





   (C)   Utility and continuity for common use:  All common open space
proposed for dedication to the city must be acceptable to it with regard to
the size, shape, location, and improvement.  In addition, the applicant must
show that the dedication of the areas as common open space will be of benefit
to the general public of the city.





(Ord. O-17-70, passed 7-7-70)





§ 153.109  IMPROVEMENTS.





   (A)   Circulation facilities.  The arrangement of public and common
ways for pedestrian and vehicular circulation in relation to other existing
or planned streets in the area and to the master plan, together with
provisions for street improvements, shall be in compliance with standards set
forth in chapters 94 and 152.  Upon application by the developer, and good
cause shown, the plan commission, with approval of city council, may permit
changes or alterations of such standards which are consistent with the spirit
and intent of this section.





   (B)   Utilities.  Whenever reasonably possible, all Planned
Residential Developments shall provide for underground installation of
utilities (including electricity and telephone) in both public ways and
private extensions thereof. Provisions shall be made for acceptable design
and construction of storm sewer facilities including grading, gutters, piping
of and treatment of turf to handle storm waters, and prevent erosion and the
formation of dust.  Utilities and maintenance of facilities shall be in
accordance with the requirements and regulations of the appropriate municipal
authority having jurisdiction thereof.  A development application shall not
be approved unless adequate assurance is given that public or quasi-public
water and sanitary sewer service will be available, except that upon
application by the developer, and good cause shown, the plan commission with
approval of the city council may modify or waive this requirement, provided
that such action is consistent with the spirit and intent of this section.





      (C)   Pedestrian circulation.  The pedestrian circulation
system and its related walkways shall be insulated as completely and as
reasonably as possible from the vehicular street system in order to provide
separation of pedestrian and vehicular movement.  This shall include, when
deemed to be necessary by the plan commission, pedestrian underpass or
overpass in the vicinity of schools, playgrounds, local shopping areas and
other neighborhood uses which generate a considerable amount of pedestrian
traffic.

§ 153.110  SUBDIVISION REVIEW.





   (A)   It is the intent of this code that subdivision review under
the subdivision code be carried out as an integral part of the review of a
Planned Residential Development under this section.  The plans required
under § 153.126 must be submitted in a form which will substantially satisfy
requirements of the subdivision code for the preliminary and final plan
approvals.





   (B)   However, if any provisions of this code and the subdivision
code are in conflict, the more restrictive or detailed requirements shall be
met, unless specifically waived or altered by the plan commission with
approval of the city council.





   (C)   It is the intent of this section to permit the submission of
subdivision applications for the whole, a part, or parts of the overall
development.

   (B)   Upon final approval, changes may be made only pursuant to a

facilities are at an equal stage of completion.  After general construction
commences, the planning and zoning committee of the city council shall
review, at least once every 6 months, all building permits issued, and
compare them to the overall plan and phasing program.  If it determines that
the rate of construction of residential units or nonresidential units
substantially differs from the phasing program, they shall so notify the
developer and the plan commission in writing. Thereafter, the city council
may issue orders to the developer as it sees fit, and, upon continued
violation of this division, may suspend the developer from further
construction until compliance is achieved.

or restrictions upon which the approval was granted are not being complied
with, the city council may rescind and revoke the approval.  Notice thereof
shall be given in accordance with § 153.128.

certificate, a temporary certificate may be issued, to be valid for a period
not to exceed 6 months from its date, during the completion of any addition
or during partial occupancy of the premises.  An occupancy certificate shall
be issued, or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the
reason why a certificate cannot be issued, not later than 30 days after the
office of the director of public services is notified in writing that the
building or premises is ready for occupancy.

§ 153.200  VARIATIONS; PURPOSES.





   The zoning board of appeals may recommend to the city council
variations of the regulations of this chapter in harmony with their general
purpose and intent, only in the specific instances set forth in § 153.203,
where the board makes a finding of fact based upon the standards prescribed
in § 153.202, that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships
in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this
chapter.





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.5-1)

   (A)   An application for variation shall be filed with the zoning
board of appeals. The application shall contain such information as the board
may, from time to time by rule, provide. Not more than 90 days after the
filing of the application, a hearing shall be held on the application.





   (B)   Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published
at least once, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the
hearing, in one or more newspapers published in the city and a sign shall be

hearing. The size of the sign shall be two feet by three feet and shall be
displayed or mounted in a conspicuous place facing the nearest road so as to
be visible to the public. The cost of the sign shall be the responsibility of
the applicant.





   (C)   The notices required by division (B) shall state the
particular location for which the variation is requested and a brief
statement of the proposed variation requested.

§ 153.202  STANDARDS FOR VARIATIONS.





   (A)   The zoning board of appeals shall not recommend the variation
of the regulations of this chapter, as authorized in § 153.203, unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:





      (1)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable
return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations in the district in which it is located.





      (2)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances.





      (3)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.





   (B)   For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the board
shall also, in making its determination as to whether there are practical
difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the extent to
which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by
the evidence:





      (1)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a
particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.





      (2)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variation
is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the
same zoning classification.





      (3)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively
upon a desire to make more money out of the property.





      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created
by any person presently having an interest in the property.





      (5)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.





      (6)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the
congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fires, endanger the
public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values in the
neighborhood.





   (C)   The zoning board of appeals may recommend to the city council
that the conditions and restrictions be imposed upon the premises benefited
by a variation which may be necessary, to comply with the standards set forth
in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of the variation
upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general
intent of this chapter. 





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.5-3)





§ 153.203  AUTHORIZED VARIATIONS.





   Variations from the regulations of this chapter may be recommended by
the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the standards set forth
in § 153.202, and may be recommended in the following instances and no
others:





   (A)   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback
required by the applicable regulations.





   (B) To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots; but in
no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than
90% of the required area and width.





   (C)   To permit exceptions to the height regulations imposed in this
chapter.

§ 153.205  ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL.




   All decisions and findings of the zoning board of appeals upon
variations arrived at after hearing shall in all instances be referred to the
city council with a report (containing findings of fact) and
recommendations.  The corporate authorities, after receiving the report and
recommendation of the zoning board of appeals, and without further public
hearing, may adopt by ordinance any proposed variation or may refer it back
to the board for further consideration, and any proposed variation which
fails to receive the approval of the zoning board of appeals shall not be
passed by the corporate authorities except by the favorable vote of
two-thirds of all the aldermen.

   An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person,
firm, or corporation, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau
aggrieved by a decision of the office of the director of public services. 
The appeal shall be taken within the time which shall be prescribed by the
zoning board of appeals by general rule, by filing with the office of the

§ 153.207  FINDINGS ON APPEALS.





   (A)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the director of public services certifies to the
zoning board of appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him,
that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the city council or by a court of record, on application,
on notice to the director of public services and zoning board of appeals, and
on due cause shown.





   (B)   The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the
hearing of the appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties, and shall
render a written decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay.  The
board may affirm, or may, upon the concurring vote of 5 members, reverse,
wholly or in part, or modify, the order, requirement, decision, or
determination, as in its opinion ought to be done, and to that end shall have
all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.





   (C)   The director of public services shall maintain complete
records of all actions of the board relative to appeals, and shall keep the
proper committee of the city council informed on a current basis of the
disposition of each case.

   For the purposes of promoting the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, and general welfare, conserving the values of property throughout
the city, and lessening or avoiding congestion in the public streets and
highways, the city council may, from time to time, in the manner set forth in
§§ 153.209 through 153.215, amend the regulations imposed and the districts
created by this chapter; provided, that in all amendatory ordinances adopted
under the authority of this section due allowance shall be made for existing
conditions, the conservation of property values, the directions of building
development to the best advantage of the entire city, and the uses to which
property is devoted at the time of the adoption of any amendatory ordinance. 





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.7-1)

('69 Code, App. A, § 10.7-2)





§ 153.210  APPLICATION FOR AMENDMENT.




   An application for an amendment shall be filed with the city clerk, in
the form and accompanied by such information as required by the city council,
and the application, upon receipt thereof, shall be transmitted by the city
clerk to a planning and zoning commission consisting of five or more persons
designated by the city council.

§ 153.211  HEARING ON APPLICATION.




   The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on each
application for an amendment at the time and place which shall be established
by the board.  The hearing shall be conducted, and a record of the
proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the planning and zoning
commission shall by rule prescribe from time to time.

at least once in a newspaper published in the city, not more than 30 days nor
less than 15 days before the hearing, in one or more newspapers published in

by three feet and shall be displayed or mounted in a conspicuous place facing
the nearest road so as to be visible to the public. The cost of the sign

particular location for which the amendment is requested and a brief
statement of the proposed amendment requested.

§ 153.213  FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE ZONING COMMISSION.




   (A)   After the close of the hearing on a proposed amendment, the
planning and zoning commission shall make written findings of fact and shall
submit the same, together with its recommendation, to the city council. 
Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the
zoning classification of particular property, the planning and zoning
commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in
each specific case with respect to the following matters:



      (1)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the
property in question.



      (2)   The zoning classification of property within the general
area of the property in question.



      (3)   The suitability of the property in question for the uses
permitted under the existing zoning classification.



      (4)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of
the property in question, including changes, if any, which may have taken
place since the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification.



   (B)   The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend the
adoption of a proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of the
amendment is in the public interest and is  not solely for the interest of
the applicant.  The planning and zoning commission may recommend the
adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification of the property
in question to any higher classification than that requested by the
applicant.  For the purpose of this section, the R Residence District shall
been considered the highest classification, and the M Manufacturing District
shall be considered the lowest classification.



   (C)   The recommendation of the planning and zoning commission shall
be based on, and limited to, the development of property as presented by the
applicant, including any modification approved by the city council, and
recorded on the title document subject to zoning restrictions of the city. 
Any basic change in the approved development proposed by the applicant or
developer, such as the resizing, rearranging, or relocating of buildings or
the changing of internal streets, walkways, entrances, exits, easements, or
parking and loading, shall be brought to the attention of the building
commissioner, who shall then inform the plan commission.  The plan
commission shall review the proposed changes.  Changes which are not basic
in the approved development, such as minor cosmetic changes, need not be
reviewed by the plan commission.  No basic change in the development made by
the developer, as approved by the planning and zoning commission, shall be
made until approval is given by the plan commission and by the city
council.  The proposed basic changes, if substantial, shall warrant a public
hearing per §§ 153.210 through 153.214.  The city council may grant
changes after review by the plan commission and without a hearing if the
council so desires.

this chapter until it shall have received a written report and recommendation
from the planning and zoning commission on the proposed amendment.

that a proposed amendment not be adopted, or in case of written protest
against any proposed amendment, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20%
of the frontage proposed to be altered, by the owners of 20% of the frontage
immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of 20%
of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, filed
with the city clerk, the amendment shall not be passed, except by the
favorable vote of two-thirds of all aldermen of the city.

finally by the city council within one year of the date upon which the
application is filed with the city clerk, it shall be deemed to have been
denied.

§ 153.215  MINIMUM SIZE OF PARCEL.





   A lot, lots, or parcel of land shall not qualify for a zoning amendment
unless it possesses 100 feet of frontage or contains 30,000 square feet of
area, or adjoins a lot, lots, or parcel of land which bears the same zoning
district classification as the proposed zoning amendment. 





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.7-8)





§ 153.216  SPECIAL USES, PURPOSE.





   The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the
division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform.  It is recognized, however,
that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot properly be classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land,
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. 
Special uses fall into two categories:





   (A)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.





   (B)   Uses entirely private in character but of such a nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities. 





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.8-1)





§ 153.217  INITIATION OF SPECIAL USES.





   Any person having a freehold interest in land, a possessory interest
entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a
freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest which is specifically
enforceable, may file an application to use the land for one or more of the
special uses provided for in this chapter in the zoning district in which the
land is situated. 





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.8-2)





§ 153.218  APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USES.





   An application for a special use shall be filed with the director of
public services on a form prescribed by the city council. The application
shall be accompanied by such plans or data as prescribed by the council, and
shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence
showing that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth
in § 153.221.





('69 Code, App. A, § 10.8-3)





§ 153.219  HEARING ON APPLICATION.





   Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement referred
to in § 153.218, the city council shall refer such applications for hearing
and recommendation to the zoning board of appeals, which shall hold a public
hearing on the application, and at least 15 days in advance of the hearing
shall cause notice of the time and place of such hearing to be published once
in a newspaper published in the city.

   For each application for a special use, the zoning board of appeals
shall report to the city council its findings and recommendations, including
the stipulations of additional conditions, and guarantees that the conditions
will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest.  The city council may grant or deny any application for
a special use; provided, that in the event of written protest against any
proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the
frontage immediately adjoining the property proposed for a special use, or by
owners of 20% of the frontage across an alley or directly opposite therefrom,
filed with the city clerk, the special use shall not be granted, except by
the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the aldermen of the city.

§ 153.221  STANDARDS.





   No special use shall be recommended by the zoning board of appeals
unless the board of appeals shall find:





   (A)   That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the
special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, or general welfare.





   (B)   That the special use  will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes
already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values
within the neighborhood.





   (C)   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district.





   (D)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.





   (E)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the
public streets.





   (F)   That the special use shall in all other respects conform to
the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except in
each instance as the regulations may be modified by the city council pursuant
to the recommendation of the zoning board of appeals.

   Off-street parking facilities serving any nonresidential use in a
district adjoining the R, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or R-5 Dwelling Districts may
be allowed as a special use in any such dwelling district, subject to the
general requirements applicable to special uses under §§ 153.216 through
153.224, and to the following additional requirements:





   (A)   The parking facilities shall be accessory to, and for use in
connection with, one or more nonresidential uses established in the adjoining
district.





   (B)   The parking facilities shall be used solely for the parking of
passenger automobiles.





   (C)   No commercial repair work or service of any kind shall be
conducted in or upon the said facilities.





   (D)   No sign of any kind other than signs designating entrances,
exits, and conditions of use shall be maintained in or upon the facilities.





   (E)   Each entrance to and exit from the parking facilities shall be
at least 20 feet distant from any adjacent property located in any dwelling
district, except where the ingress to the parking facilities is provided from
a public alley or public way separating the residential areas from the

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT



§ 153.240  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the regulations, standards, and criteria contained in
this chapter is to provide an alternate zoning procedure under which land can
be developed or redeveloped with innovation, imagination, and creative
architectural design when sufficiently justified under the provisions of this
chapter. The objective of the planned unit development is to encourage a
higher level of design and amenity than is possible to achieve under
otherwise applicable zoning regulations. The end result can be a product
which fulfills the objectives of the city comprehensive plan and the planning
policies of the city while departing from the strict application of the use
and bulk regulations of the zoning title. The planned unit development is
intended to permit and encourage such flexibility and to accomplish the
following purposes:



   (A)   To stimulate creative approaches to non-single-family
development of land (i.e. commercial, multifamily residential, commercial/
mixed-use, industrial, institutional, etc.).



   (B)   To provide more efficient use of land.



   (C)   To preserve natural features and provide open space areas and
recreation areas in excess of that required under existing zoning regulations.



   (D)   To develop new approaches to the living environment through
variety in type, design and layout of buildings, transportation systems, and
public facilities.



   (E)   To unify building and structures through design.



   (F)   Promotion of long term planning pursuant to the comprehensive
plan, which will allow harmonious and compatible land uses or combination of
uses with surrounding areas.



(Ord. O-37-15, passed 10-6-15)



§ 153.241  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   No non-single-family residential development falling into the
following categories shall be permitted unless approved as a planned unit
development in accordance with the zoning ordinance.



      (1)   All developments located between 122nd Street and 124th
Street and having a Harlem Avenue frontage of 100 feet or more.



      (2)   All developments within the Harlem Avenue Overlay
District having a lot area of one acre or greater.



      (3)   All developments not within the Harlem Avenue Overlay
District having an area of two acres or greater.



   (B)   Each planned unit development should be presented and judged
on its own merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for
approval of a planned unit development upon an already existing planned unit
development except to the extent such planned unit development has been
approved as part of a larger planned unit development master plan.



   (C)   The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any
planned unit development is necessary and desirable shall in every case rest
with the applicant.



   (D)   Buildings and uses or combinations of uses within a planned
unit development shall be limited solely to those approved as part of the
ordinance granting a planned unit development permit provided, however, that
any buildings and uses or combinations of uses in compliance with a
development plan approved as part of the ordinance granting a planned unit
development permit may be approved by the city council.



(Ord. O-37-15, passed 10-6-15)



§ 153.242  STANDARDS FOR REVIEW.



   Modifications in conventional zoning and subdivision regulations are
privileges and will be considered by the city only in direct response to the
accrual of tangible benefits from the planned unit development to the city or
the neighborhood/area in which it would be located. These benefits shall be
in the form of exceptional amenities, landscape, architectural or site
design, or the conservation of special man-made or natural features of the
site. In reviewing an application for a planned unit development, the
planning and zoning commission and/or the city council, as the case may be,
shall be required to make certain findings based on the following standards.



   (A)   Required findings.  No application for a planned unit
development shall be approved unless all of the following findings are made
about the proposal:



      (1)   Comprehensive plan.  The planned unit development shall
conform with the general planning policies of the city as set forth in the
comprehensive plan.



      (2)   Public welfare.  The planned unit development shall be
so designed, located and proposed to be operated and maintained that it will
not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property and will
not substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the
public health, safety and welfare.



      (3)   Impact on other property. The planned unit development
shall not be injurious to the use or enjoyment of other property in the
neighborhood for the purposes permitted in the district, shall not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties for
uses permitted in the zoning district, shall not be inconsistent with the
community character of the neighborhood, shall not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood and will be consistent with the goals,
objectives, and policies set forth in the comprehensive plan, and shall not
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood, or
be incompatible with other property in the immediate vicinity.



      (4)   Impact on public facilities and resources. The planned
unit development shall be so designed that adequate utilities, road access,
drainage, and other necessary facilities will be provided to serve it. The
planned unit development shall include such impact donations as may be
reasonably determined by the city council. These required impact donations
shall be calculated in reasonable proportion to impact of the planned unit
development on public facilities and infrastructure.



      (5)   Archaeological, historical or cultural impact. The
planned unit development shall not substantially adversely affect a known
archaeological, historical, or cultural resource located on or off of the
parcel proposed for development.



      (6)   Parking and traffic. The planned unit development shall
have or make adequate provision to provide ingress and egress to the proposed
use in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion in the public streets,
provides appropriate cross access to adjacent properties and parking areas,
and provide adequate access for emergency vehicles.



      (7)   Adequate buffering. The planned unit development shall
have adequate landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to
protect uses within the development and surrounding properties.



      (8)   Signage. Any signage on the site of the planned unit
development shall be in conformity with the city's zoning ordinance (sign
ordinance), or shall satisfy the standards of review for variations set forth
therein.



   (B)   Modification standards. In addition to the findings required
above, the following standards shall be utilized in considering applications
for modifications of the conventional zoning and subdivision regulations for
a planned unit development.  These standards shall not be regarded as
inflexible, but shall be used as a framework by the city to test the quality
of the amenities, benefits to the community, and design and desirability of
the proposal.



      (1)   Integrated design. A planned unit development shall be
laid out and developed as a unit in accordance with an integrated overall
design. This design shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and
harmonious grouping of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate
relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and
structural features.



      (2)   Beneficial common open space. Any common open space in
the planned unit development shall be integrated into the overall design.
Such spaces shall have a direct functional or visual relationship to the main
building(s) and not be of isolated or leftover character. The following would
not be considered usable common open space:



         (a)   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of
an individual tenant or owner.



         (b)   Dedicated streets, alleys and other public
rights-of-way.



         (c)   Vehicular drives, parking, loading and storage
area.



         (d)   Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land less
than 15 feet wide.



      (3)   Functional and mechanical features. Exposed storage
areas, trash and garbage retainers, exposed machinery installations, service
areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar
accessory areas and structures shall be accounted for in the design of the
planned unit development and made as unobtrusive as possible. They shall be
subject to such setbacks, special planting or other screening methods as
shall reasonably be required to prevent their being incongruous with the
existing or contemplated environment and the surrounding properties.



      (4)   Visual and acoustical privacy. The planned unit
development shall provide reasonable visual, and acoustical privacy for each
dwelling unit. Fences, insulations, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be
used as appropriate for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property
and the privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable view or uses,
and reduction of noises.



      (5)   Drives, parking and circulation. Principal vehicular
access shall be from dedicated public streets, and access points shall be
designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements
and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. With respect to
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and
parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access
points to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points,
general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
adequate provision for service by emergency vehicles, and arrangement of
parking areas that are safe and convenient, and insofar as feasible, do not
detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the
neighboring properties.



      (6)   Surface water drainage. Special attention shall be given
to proper site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not
adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system.
Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it
will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.



(Ord. O-37-15, passed 10-6-15)



§ 153.243  SITE DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCES.



   Notwithstanding any limitations on variations which can be approved as
contained elsewhere in the zoning code, site development allowances, i.e.
deviations or variations from the underlying zoning provisions set forth
outside this chapter may be approved provided the applicant specifically
identifies each such site development allowance and demonstrates how each
such site development allowance would be compatible with surrounding
development, is in furtherance of the stated objectives of this section and
is necessary for proper development of the site.



(Ord. O-37-15, passed 10-6-15)



§ 153.244  PROCEDURES.



   The following steps are provided to assure the orderly review of every
planned unit development application in a timely and equitable manner:



   (A)   Preliminary council review.



      (1)   Application, purpose, and procedure:



         (a)   A prospective applicant, prior to meeting with
city staff for a formal pre-filing review, shall appear before the city
council for a preliminary board review.  The applicant shall coordinate with
the city administrator to be placed on a city council agenda and scheduled
for the earliest appropriate city council meeting.  At a minimum, the
applicant shall provide the following materials to the city council for its
preliminary review:



            1.    Preliminary concept plan of the development;
and



            2.   A brief narrative describing the overall
character, intensity, uses, and nature of the proposed planned unit
development.



         (b)   The purpose of such review shall be to broadly
acquaint the city council with the applicant's proposal and to provide the
applicant with any preliminary views or concerns that members of the council
may have at a time in the process when positions are still flexible and
adjustment is still possible and prior to the time when the applicant is
required to expend the funds necessary to prepare the complete documentation
required for a formal application.



         (c)   At the meeting at which the preliminary council
review is conducted, any member of the city council may make any comments,
suggestions or recommendations regarding the preliminary development concept
deemed necessary or appropriate by that member; provided, however, that no
final or binding action shall be taken with respect to any preliminary
application. Any views expressed in the course of the city council's review
of any preliminary development concept shall be deemed to be only preliminary
and advisory and only the individual views of the member expressing them.
Nothing said or done in the course of such review shall be deemed to create,
or to prejudice, any rights of the applicant or to obligate the city council,
or any member of it, to approve or deny any formal application following full
consideration thereof as required by this code.



   (B)   Pre-filing review and transmittal of application.



      (1)   Conference:



         (a)   A prospective applicant, prior to submitting a

official or employee designated by the city administrator. The purpose of the
conference(s) is to help the applicant understand the comprehensive plan, the
zoning title, the site development allowances, the standards by which the
application will be evaluated, and the application requirements.



         (b)   After reviewing the planned unit development
process, the applicant may request a waiver of any application requirement
which in the applicant's judgment should not apply to the proposed planned
unit development. Such request shall be made in writing prior to the
submission of the formal application documents.



         (c)   All requests for waiver shall be reviewed within
15 working days by the city council. A final determination regarding the
waiver shall be given to the prospective applicant following the decision.



         (d)   If deemed appropriate by the city administrator,
the applicant, prior to submitting a formal application for a planned unit
development, will be required to schedule a meeting to discuss the proposed
planned unit development and its impact on area residents. If such a meeting
is required, the applicant shall send a written notice of the meeting via
certified mail to all taxpayers of record and residents for all property
within 500 feet of the proposed planned unit development. Such notice shall
be mailed not less than 15 days prior to the date of the meeting. A copy of
the notice and mailing list shall be provided to the city administrator. A
written summary of comments made at the meeting shall be maintained and
submitted by the applicant with the application.



      (2)   Filing of application: Following the completion of the

writing of any deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process the
application until the deficiencies are remedied.



      (4)   Report on compliance: A copy of the complete application
and a written report incorporating the comments of city staff and other
agencies regarding the compliance of the proposed planned unit development
with the requirements and standards of this section shall be delivered to the
planning and zoning commission prior to the public hearing.



      (5)   Determination not binding: Neither the city
administrator's determination that an application is complete nor any comment
made by the city administrator or city staff at a pre-filing conference or as
part of the review process shall be intended or construed as a formal or
informal recommendation for the approval of a planned unit development permit
for the proposed planned unit development, or component part thereof, nor
shall be intended or construed as a binding decision of the city, the
planning and zoning commission or any staff member.



   (C)   Review and action by the planning and zoning commission.



      (1)   Upon receiving the report from the city administrator,
the planning and zoning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on
the proposed planned unit development.



      (2)   Notice of the required public hearing shall be published
by the city not more than 30 nor less than 15 days before the scheduled
hearing in a newspaper published in the city or if there is none, then in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city and shall contain the following
information:

public hearing.



      (3)   Notice of the required public hearing shall also be
provided by the city by posting a sign or signs on the property no less than
15 days prior to the public hearing. The sign shall be weatherproof and
contain such information as is required in division (C)(2)(b) above. Failure
to post such sign(s) and/or the removal or knocking down (by the city or
others) of the sign after posting but before the public hearing shall not
invalidate, impair, or otherwise affect any planned unit development permit
subsequently granted following such public hearing.



      (4)   Notice of the required public hearing shall also be
provided by the applicant by Certified U.S. Mail to the taxpayers of record
and owners of record of the property which is the subject of the application
(if different than the applicant), and the taxpayers of record and residents
of all property within 500 feet of the subject property. Such notice shall
contain the information as is required in division (C)(2)(b) above and shall
be mailed not more than 30 nor less than 15 days prior to the date of the

recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, and without further
public hearing, the city council shall either deny the application; refer the
application back to the planning and zoning commission for further review;
postpone further consideration pending the submittal of additional
information, including any application requirement previously waived; or
adopt an ordinance approving the planned unit development permit.



      (2)   Any action taken by the city council pursuant to
division (D)(1) above shall require the concurrence of a majority of all the
city council then holding office.



      (3)   In approving a planned unit development permit, the city
council may attach such conditions to the approval as it deems necessary to
have the proposed use or combination of uses meet the standards set forth in
this section and to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other property in
the immediate vicinity. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to:
limitations on size, bulk and location; requirements for landscaping,
signage, outdoor lighting, provisions for adequate ingress and egress; hours
of operation; and such other conditions as the city council may deem to be in
furtherance of the objectives of this section.

change made by the applicant, direct the city administrator to process the
request other than as a minor change.

§ 155.01  RESTRICTIONS ON FILL USED.




   (A)   Before any fill is placed, the trees, stumps, and hedges from
the entire area to be filled must be removed.  Only fill can be used that
will compact and develop a satisfactory stability.  Sod, frozen material, or
any matter which by decay or otherwise might cause settlement shall not be
allowed.  Crushed material, broken concrete, stones, or rocks shall be well
distributed and sufficient earth or other fine materials shall be
incorporated with them when they are deposited to fill the interstices.  No
stones, rocks, or broken concrete more than four inches in largest dimension
shall be permitted within a vertical distance of 12 inches from the surface
of the finished grade.





   (B)   Pieces of concrete not exceeding two square feet for any area
of surface and large rocks and boulders may be placed in filled area without
being broken up, provided they are well embedded and the interstices filled
in such a manner as to give proper density.





   (C)   Violation of the foregoing restrictions on the use of fill
shall result in a fine of $250 per day for each day improper fill is located
on the premises.  In addition, the land owner shall be responsible for the
cost of removing any unlawful material located on the premises together with
court costs and attorney's fees incurred by the city in connection with any
civil or criminal actions.

   Where construction is planned on filled land, compacting equipment and
compacting operations shall be coordinated with the rate of placing the fill
so the required density is obtained.  If the area to be filled requires less
than 1-1/2 feet of material, it shall be compacted to not less than 95% of
the standard laboratory density.  If the area to be filled exceeds 3 feet in
depth, the lower 1/3 of fill shall be compacted to 90% of standard laboratory
density, the middle l/3 of fill to 93%, and the upper 1/3 to 95% of standard
laboratory density.

chapter, the Commissioner shall evaluate all buildings in the city he
believes to be unoccupied on the effective date of this chapter and make a
determination for each as to whether the building is a vacant building within

unoccupied and make a determination as to whether each building is a vacant
building.

buildings, he shall, within seven days of making such determination, send a
written notice of determination with the factual findings to the last
taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Cook County tax roll. Said

email address, and telephone number of all persons with any legal interest in
the vacant building, or the premises. The form shall require the owner to
identify a natural person 21 years of age or older who maintains a permanent
address in Cook County, Illinois to accept service on behalf of the owner
with respect to any notices the Commissioner sends pursuant to this chapter,

current with the Commissioner the information required regarding the person
designated to accept notice and service of process.



   (C)   All boarded buildings must be registered with the City of
Palos Heights Building Department. Failure to register within 14 days of the

property and invoicing the responsible party. Structures that the city has
boarded up will automatically be registered and a lien placed on the property
to recover the registration fee and cost of board-up service.



   (D)   Registration does not exonerate the owner from compliance with
all applicable codes and ordinances, policies or regulations, including this
chapter, nor does it preclude any of the actions the city is authorized to
take pursuant to this chapter or elsewhere in the City Code.



   (E)   Renewal and amended registration requirements. The owner of a
vacant building shall renew the vacant building registration annually no

construction or similar type. The proposed repair shall result in openings
being secured by conventional methods used in the design of the building or
by methods permitted for new construction of similar type with board removed.
The owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until
the building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy.



      (2)   For building and/or premises which are determined by the

of all actions required to achieve habitability. No plan which fails to
provide for compliance with this chapter, or which will not, as determined by
the Commissioner, achieve such compliance, within six months, in the case of
a vacant boarded building, and two years, in the case of a vacant,
un-boarded, and code-compliant building will be approved, except that the
commissioner may approve an extension of the time during which the building
will be unoccupied beyond two years to a date certain, but then only based
upon clear and documented evidence of good cause shown by the owner as
determined by the Commissioner.



   (B)   All premises upon which vacant buildings are located, and the
building exteriors, shall at all times be maintained in compliance with the

      (1)   The purposes of this chapter and intent of the city is
to minimize the time a building is boarded or otherwise vacant.



      (2)   The effect of the building and the proposed plan on
adjoining property.



      (3)   The length of time the building has been vacant.

failure to obtain the Commissioner's approval of a vacant building plan
within 30 days of filing the registration form, failure to submit a revised
plan within 15 days of the date of the Commissioner's written denial of a

§ 156.43  TIME RESTRICTIONS-VACANT AND/OR BOARDED BUILDINGS.



   (A)   It is the policy of the city that boarding is a temporary
solution to prevent unauthorized entry into a building and that vacant
buildings are a public nuisance. A vacant building may not remain boarded or
vacant longer than six months unless an extension of that time is part of a
plan approved by the Commissioner. At the end of the six month period, the
owner must have taken one or more of the following steps:



      (1)   The boards shall be removed and windows, doors, and
penetrations shall be in good repair;



      (2)   A demolition permit has been obtained and work scheduled
to begin within 10 days;

structure with the work having been started; or



      (4)   The building has been listed for sale or rent with a
multiple listing services (MLS) real estate broker at a reasonable asking
price and the building shall be available for viewing by potential buyers. A
reasonable price will be the assessed value or less.



   (B)   Note. Division (A)(1) above must have taken place. The maximum
amount of time a compliant structure will be allowed to remain vacant is two
years and only with Commissioner approval. A compliant structure that has
been vacant longer than two years and it is shown that a good faith effort to
occupy the structure has been proven will be considered for extension beyond
the two years.



   (C)   This regulation does not excuse the owner from following all
other provisions of the city code regarding the care and upkeep of the
property, including without limitation, maintaining the yard and keeping it
junk and litter free.



(Ord. O-29-16, passed 11-1-16)

day the violation(s) continues. Each day the violation(s) continues shall be
a separate offense. In addition to the fine, the owner, or his or her agent
shall be ordered to bring the structure or building into compliance with the
requirements of this section within 15 days.



(Ord. O-29-16, passed 11-1-16)



§ 156.45  OTHER ENFORCEMENT.

city to demolish or to take other action against the building pursuant to
other provisions of this chapter, the city code, or other applicable
legislation.

§ 157.01  PURPOSE.



   Trees are critical partners in the ecosystem of our planet and our
community. Trees enhance the aesthetics of neighborhoods; increase property
values; provide food, nesting, migratory opportunities and a safe haven for
birds and other animals; help to control flooding and soil erosion; provide
shade and wind protection; reduce noise; filter pollutants; purify the air
exchanging carbon dioxide with oxygen; support the overall balance of nature;
and add to the beauty of the whole city, increasing the quality of life for
all. Thus, it is the philosophy of the city to protect, preserve and increase
the number of trees in the Community Forest of the city.
