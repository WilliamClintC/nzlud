possession of the Police Department. All officers and members of the Police Department who, in the course of duty, come into possession of any
personal property shall deliver it promptly to the property custodian, unless it is needed for immediate use as evidence. If it is needed immediately as

shall use such forum as may be approved by the Chief of Police to give notice of the sale, describe the property in general terms and specify the
Village's intent to sell it to the public for cash.
The property will then be sold to the public. Property offered, but not sold, may be offered and sold at a subsequent public sale without further notice.
If any personal property is deemed to be of use to any Village department, the property may be retained for use of the department upon approval of the
Chief of Police.
Any personal property specified as not amenable to sale for any reason by the property custodian shall be confiscated or destroyed.
The proceeds of any sale, after deducting the cost of storage, advertising, and other expenses incident to the handling and sale of the property, shall
be paid by the property custodian to the Village of Mount Prospect finance director who shall deposit the proceeds into the general fund of the Village.

presented to the Chief of Police for destruction within one year after receipt.

the Chief of Police the perishable nature of the property, and upon the approval of the Chief of Police, shall cause the property, if amenable to sale, to
be advertised for sale by posting at three (3) public places within the Village and shall sell such personal property to the public at any time after three

provide copies of the report to the village board, the complainant, the supervisor and the respondent. The village manager will also notify the village
board of any change in administrative procedures or any disciplinary action that has been or will be taken with respect to any employee.
14. Continuances: Any complainant, supervisor or respondent, may request, and shall be granted, one continuance, without cause, of a hearing on a
complaint. If a complainant fails to appear at a scheduled hearing without giving prior written notice to the secretary and has not previously used a
continuance, the hearing shall be continued. Any further requests for a continuance by the complainant, supervisor or respondent, shall be subject to
the approval of the commission for good cause shown.
15. Withdrawal Of Complaint: If the complainant chooses to withdraw his or her complaint, then the proceeding may be deemed complete and the
commission shall have no obligation to transmit a report and findings to the village board. However, if the complainant alleges that he or she
withdrew his or her complaint because he or she was the subject of overt acts of retaliation, harassment or threats committed by an official of the
village, then the complainant may renew his or her prior complaint within sixty (60) days of the alleged overt retaliatory, harassing or threatening act
in conformity with these rules. (Ord. 6149, 8-5-2014)
5.709: FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL:
It is required that the hiring, promotion and discipline of sworn fire and police personnel be governed by specific state and local law. Because of the
specificity and complexity of these procedures, it is neither practical nor proper to have them compromised in any manner by providing a concurrent
process for investigating or hearing complaints against such officials. Therefore, while retaining the authority to receive complaints against sworn fire or
police personnel, the commission will immediately forward such complaints to the respective fire or police chief. The appropriate chief will then provide a
written monthly report to the commission and the village manager as to the procedural progress of the matter and will file a final report describing its
ultimate disposition. Occasionally, certain portions of a final disposition may be subject to a confidentiality requirement. In such instances, these portions
may not be transmitted to the community relations commission. However, no disposition to be presented to the board of fire and police commissioners may
be subject to confidentiality provisions unless approved in writing by the village manager.
If, after all administrative and judicial appeals have been exhausted, the complainant is not satisfied with the result of the board of fire and police
commissioners' process, the complainant may then request a hearing on the matter before the commission and such hearing shall be conducted pursuant
to these rules. In the event a hearing is commenced pursuant to this section, the commission may make recommendations with respect to avoiding such
complaints in the future, but shall make no recommendation with respect to the disciplining of the respondent. (Ord. 6149, 8-5-2014)

6.5.301: REQUIREMENT OF A FRANCHISE:
No person, firm, company, corporation or association shall construct, install, maintain or operate a cable television system within the Village, or within any
other public property of the Village, unless a franchise has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Article, and unless such franchise is in full
force and effect. Such franchise shall not take the place of any other license or permit which may be legally required of the grantee in order to conduct
such a business. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.302: FRANCHISE APPLICATIONS:
A. After receiving applications for a franchise, the Board, after considering financial, technical, programming, and rate proposals, and the legal and
character qualifications of the applicants, may, by ordinance, grant one or more nonexclusive franchises creating a right to construct and operate a
cable television system within the public ways of the Village. Franchise(s) will be granted to the applicant(s) which in the Board's judgment may best
serve the public interest; provided, however, no provision of this Article shall be deemed or construed as to require the Board to grant a franchise.
B. The application for a cable television franchise shall be submitted to the Village, or its designee, on a written application form furnished by the Village,
and in accordance with procedures and schedules to be established by the Village. The application form may request facts and information the Village
deems appropriate. Applications shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee in an amount determined by the Village, which amount shall
be used by the Village, to offset direct expenses incurred in the franchising and evaluation procedures, including, but not limited to, staff time and
consulting assistance.
C. An applicant (grantee) to whom the Village grants a nonexclusive franchise shall, in addition to the nonrefundable fee specified hereinabove, pay to the
Village at the time the grantee files the written instrument specified in Section 6.5.709 of this Article an amount determined by the Board to be used to
offset all direct, reasonable expenses actually incurred by the Village in granting the franchise which are not defrayed by fees forthcoming from the
provisions of subsection B of this Section. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.401: FRANCHISE TERM AND NONEXCLUSIVITY:
The term of an original franchise shall be no more than fifteen (15) years from the date the franchise is accepted by the grantee. The term of a renewed
franchise shall be no more than fifteen (15) years. No franchise granted pursuant to this Article shall give any exclusive right to a grantee and every such
franchise shall be deemed to reserve the right to grant other franchises to use and occupy the public ways of the Village for cable television or any other
purpose on such terms as the Village may then deem appropriate. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.402: NOTICE TO THE GRANTEE:
Except as provided in subsection 6.5.404A of this Article, the Village shall not take any final action involving the evaluation, modification, renewal,

revocation or termination of the grantee's franchise unless the Village has: a) called a meeting for such purpose; b) advised the grantee in writing, at least
thirty (30) days prior to such meeting, as to its time, place and purpose; and c) published a notice, at least once, ten (10) days before the meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Village. The grantee and any interested person shall be entitled to be heard at such meeting. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-
1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.403: FRANCHISE REVIEW AND MODIFICATION:
It shall be the policy of the Village to amend a franchise, upon application of the grantee, when necessary to enable the grantee to take advantage of
technological advancements which will afford it an opportunity to more effectively, efficiently, or economically serve its subscribers; provided, however, that
this Section shall not be construed to require the Village to make any amendment. Further, within the term of the franchise, the Village may, after notice
and hearing as required in Section 6.5.402 of this Article, adopt a resolution providing for reasonable and appropriate modifications in the grantee's
franchise of a nature that would not result in effectively terminating same, provided that the Village shall not make any amendments or modifications to this
Article or a franchise granted hereunder which would alter the provisions of subsections 6.5.405D or 6.5.406E of this Article during the term of any
franchise granted hereunder. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.404: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SESSIONS:
A. The Village and the grantee shall hold performance evaluation meetings within thirty (30) days of the third, fifth, tenth and fourteenth anniversary dates
of the grantee's award of the franchise and as required by Federal and State law. All such evaluation meetings shall be open to the public. The grantee
shall be solely responsible for notifying the Village, in writing, at least sixty (60) days in advance, of each of the specified performance evaluation
meetings, and no notice to the grantee pursuant to Section 6.5.402 of this Article shall be required.
B. Special evaluation meetings may be held at any time during the term of the franchise at the request of the agency or the grantee.
C. All evaluation meetings shall be open to the public and announced by the Board in a newspaper of general circulation in accordance with the notice
requirements of Section 6.5.402 of this Article. No such newspaper notice shall be required as to any adjourned meetings. The grantee shall notify
subscribers of all evaluation meetings including any adjourned meetings by announcement on the highest use origination channel on the system no
less than three (3) times between the hours of seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. and nine o'clock (9:00) P.M. for five (5) consecutive days immediately
preceding each meeting.
D. Topics which may be discussed at any scheduled or special evaluation session may include, but not be limited to, service rate structures, franchise
fees, penalties, free or discounted services, applications of new technologies, system performance, services provided, programming offered, customer
complaints, privacy, amendments to this Article, modification to the franchise, judicial and FCC rulings, line extension policies and grantee or Village
rules.
E. During a review and evaluation by the Village, the grantee shall fully cooperate with the Village and shall provide such information and documents as
the Village may request to reasonably perform its review.
F. If at any time during its review, the Village determines that reasonable evidence exists of inadequate CATV system performance, it may require the
grantee to perform tests and analysis directed toward the suspected inadequacies. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the Village in performing such
testing and shall prepare results and a report if requested within thirty (30) days after notice. Such report shall include the following information:
1. The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests;
2. What system component was tested;
3. The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
4. The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved;
5. Any other information pertinent to said tests and analysis which may be required;
6. The Village may require the test to be supervised at grantee's expense by a professional engineer to be approved by the Village not on the
permanent staff of the grantee. The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the Village such records with a report interpreting
the results of the test and recommending actions to be taken.
G. The Village's rights under this Section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on
said complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the Village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.405: FRANCHISE RENEWAL:
A. The grantee shall be solely responsible for requesting the Village, in writing, to hold a special meeting, the purpose of which will be to review the
grantee's performance during the term of its franchise, to consider the adequacy of the franchise from the standpoint of the Village, the grantee, and
the Federal Communications Commission "Rules for Cable Television", and to determine the advisability of renewing the grantee's franchise. Unless
the Village shall consent to some lesser notice, said request shall be made not less than twelve (12) months prior to the franchise expiration date. Upon
receipt of said request, the Village shall adopt a resolution setting forth the time and place of the special meeting. If no request for renewal is made, the
franchise shall expire according to its terms; provided, however, that the Board may extend the term of the franchise in six (6) month increments during
the franchise renewal process provided for in this Section.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 60/724
B. The Village shall hear any interested persons during said special meeting and shall determine whether or not the grantee did reasonably comply with
the terms and conditions imposed by this Article and the franchise. Notice of such meeting shall be given in accordance with Section 6.5.402 and
subsection 6.5.404C of this Article.
C. If the Village determines that the grantee has been in reasonable compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by this Article and the franchise,
the Village may, by resolution, renew the grantee's franchise, with any modifications it deems desirable, for a period of time not longer than fifteen (15)
years.
D. Notwithstanding the fact that the Board may determine that the grantee has been in reasonable compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by
this Article and the franchise, the Board shall have the right not to renew the franchise. If the Board does not renew the franchise, the Board shall, to
the extent then permitted by existing law, have the options to: 1) acquire at fair market value all the assets of the grantee's operations within the Village;
or 2) require the sale at fair market value of all such assets to a succeeding grantee; or 3) require the removal of all such assets from the Village.
Except as provided in Section 6.5.408 of this Article, the Board's abovestated options must be exercised within one year from the date of the franchise
expiration, unless such period is extended with the consent of the grantee.
E. The Village shall have the right to recoup from the grantee all direct expenses incurred pursuant to renewal of the franchise whether or not the franchise
is renewed. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.406: FRANCHISE REVOCATION PROCEDURE:
A. Whenever a grantee shall refuse, neglect or wilfully fail to construct, operate or maintain its cable television system or to provide service to its
subscribers in substantial accordance with the terms of this Article and the franchise or to comply with the conditions of occupancy of any public way or
to make required extensions of service, or shall in any other way substantially violate the terms and conditions of this Article, the franchise, or any
applicable rule or regulations, or practices any fraud or deceit upon the Village or its subscribers, or fails to pay franchise fees when due, or if a grantee
becomes insolvent, as adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, or is unwilling to pay its uncontested debts, or is adjudged bankrupt, or seeks
relief under the bankruptcy laws, then the franchise may be revoked.
B. In the event the Village or the agency believes that grounds for revocation exist or have existed, the Village or agency may notify a grantee, in writing,
setting forth the nature and facts of such noncompliance. If, within thirty (30) days following such written notification, the grantee has not furnished
reasonably satisfactory evidence that corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, or that alleged violations did not
occur, or that the alleged violations were beyond the grantee's control, the agency shall thereupon refer the matter to the Village.
C. Upon referral from the agency or by its own motion, the Village may, following notice of the grounds for revocation, and hearing pursuant to Section
6.5.402 of this Article, evoke a franchise pursuant to subsection A of this Section.
D. In the event that a franchise has been revoked by the Village, the Village shall, to the extent then permitted by existing law, have the options to: 1)
acquire, at the lesser of depreciated replacement value, or fair market value, excluding any value attributable to good will, all the assets of the grantee's
operations within the Village; or 2) to require the sale, at the lesser of depreciated replacement value, or the fair market value, excluding any value
attributable to good will, of all such assets of the grantee's operations within the Village to a successor grantee or 3) to require the removal of all such
assets from the Village. Unless some later date is agreed to by the grantee and except as provided in Section 6.5.408 of this Article, such option must
be exercised within one year from the date of the revocation of the franchise, or the entry of the final judgment by a court reviewing the question of the
Village's revocation, or the entry of a final order upon appeal of same, whichever is later.
E. The termination of a grantee's rights under a franchise shall in no way affect any other rights the Village may have under the franchise or under any
provision of law or ordinance. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.407: ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION BY GRANTEE:
If a grantee arbitrarily and capriciously discontinues service to a substantial number of its subscribers, the grantee's franchise may be revoked by a
resolution of the Village following notice to the grantee and an opportunity to be heard. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.5.402 of this Article,
notice to the grantee under this Section may be less than thirty (30) days. Provided further, the Village may seek appropriate judicial or other relief and/or
may proceed to exercise its rights and powers as provided for herein. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.408: PROVISION FOR ARBITRATION:
In the event the Board exercises its options to acquire all of the assets of the grantee, and the fair market or depreciated replacement value cannot be
agreed upon, said value(s) shall be determined by a panel of arbitrators, which panel may be requested by either the Board or the grantee no sooner than
ninety (90) days after notice that the Village desires to purchase the system. The panel shall be composed of one arbitrator chosen by the Village, one
arbitrator chosen by the grantee, and a third arbitrator chosen by the first two (2) arbitrators. The expenses of the arbitration, including the fees of the
arbitrators, shall be borne by the parties in such manner as the arbitrators provide in their award, but in no event will the Village be obligated for more than
one-half (1/2) of said expenses. The determination of a majority of the arbitrators shall be binding on the parties. The arbitrators shall follow the rules and
procedures of the American Arbitration Association except where in conflict with an express provision of this Article. The arbitration hearing shall take
place in Cook County, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. Notwithstanding any other timetable imposed by this Article, the Village shall,
within ninety (90) days following notice to it of the decision of the arbitrators, either withdraw any notice it may have given of its intent or election to acquire
the grantee's system or shall affirmatively accept the decision of the arbitrators and affirm its election to purchase the system or assets. If the Village fails
to accept the arbitrator's decision and affirm its election to purchase within the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, the rights of the Village to purchase shall
expire. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 61/724
6.5.409: TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO GRANTOR:
In those circumstances wherein the Village shall have elected to purchase ownership of all the assets of the grantee's operations within the Village, the
Village shall, unless the grantee shall agree to some other terms, pay, in cash to the grantee, the price of such assets plus any interest calculated at an
annual rate of two (2) percentage points over the prime rate given by the Continental Illinois National Bank to its most credit-worthy borrowers of demand
loans, which may have accrued from the date the Village or any interim operator assumed direction and control of the grantee's cable system within the
Village to the date of payment. Such payment shall be made within twelve (12) months following the date upon which the election to purchase becomes
irrevocable. Title to the system or assets shall pass to the grantor upon such payment. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.410: GRANTEE'S OBLIGATION AS TRUSTEE:
A. At all times from the expiration or revocation of a franchise and until either: 1) a grantee transfers to the Village or other succeeding operator of the
system all of its rights, title and interest to all assets, real and personal, related to its cable television system in the Village; or 2) the Village's right to
either acquire or assign its rights to acquire any of the grantee's assets expires without the Village having exercised such a right, whichever occurs first,
the grantee shall have a duty to such successor as a trustee holding such assets for the benefit of such successor and the grantee shall not sell any of
the system assets in the Village nor shall the grantee make any physical, material, or administrative operational changes that would tend to: 1) degrade
the quality of service to the subscribers; 2) decrease gross revenues; or 3) materially increase expenses without the expressed permission, in writing,
of the Village or its assigns. Immediately upon the assumption of operating control of the system by the grantee, as Trustee, or a successor Trustee,
the Village shall cause an independent appraisal and inventory of all the assets of the system to be made to verify and establish the existence and
condition of all such real and personal property of the system. The grantee shall at all times operate the system in accordance with terms of this Article
and the terms of the franchise as if the franchise had not expired or had not been revoked. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to operate the
system as a Trustee, the Village shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver or to operate the
system itself as a trustee in accordance with the terms of this Article and the terms of the franchise.
B. In the event of expiration or revocation of a franchise, this Section shall not be construed to give a grantee any vested or other franchise right, but the
right of the grantee in such circumstances shall exist only on a day-to-day basis until the transfer is affected.
C. As full compensation for its ownership interests during this interim period, the grantee shall be entitled to receive the net profit generated during the
period between the expiration or revocation of the franchise, as the case may be, and the transfer of title to the grantee's assets to the village or a
successor grantee. Net profit shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reported on a basis which is
consistent and comparable with the format of the books and accounts maintained by the grantee during the immediately preceding two (2) fiscal years
and as presented in the audited financial statements.
D. Further, this section shall in no way limit the power of the village, upon expiration or revocation of a franchise, to require the grantee to cease all
operations whatsoever and/or remove its assets from the village, or otherwise exercise any rights the village would otherwise have. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-
1981; amd. Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.411: FRANCHISE FEE:
A. The grantee, in consideration of the privilege granted under the franchise for the operation of a cable television system, and the expense of regulation
pursuant to the franchise incurred by the village, shall pay to the village a percent of its annual gross revenues during the period of its operation under
the franchise. This percent shall be set forth in the franchise and shall be no more than the maximum amount as may be set from time to time by
controlling federal or state law. Such franchise fee shall be payable to the village within thirty (30) days of the close of each month in which the grantee
provides service to the village.
B. The grantee shall file with the village, within thirty (30) days after the expiration of each of the grantee's fiscal quarters, a statement clearly showing the
gross revenues received by grantee during the preceding quarter. The grantee shall also file, within one hundred twenty (120) days following the
conclusion of the grantee's fiscal year, an annual report prepared and audited, at grantee's expense, by an independent certified public accountant
acceptable to the village, clearly showing the yearly total gross revenues.
C. The village shall have the right, consistent with the provision of subsection 6.5.502C of this article, to inspect the grantee's income records, the right of
audit and the recomputation of any amounts determined to be payable under this article. Any additional amount due the village as a result of the audit
shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the village which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost of
said audit shall be borne by the grantee if it is properly determined, by an independent auditor chosen by the village and grantee, if necessary, that the
grantee's annual payment due to the village for the preceding year is increased thereby by more than five percent (5%); otherwise, such costs shall be
borne by the village.
D. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
charged from such date at an annual rate of two (2) percentage points over the prime rate given by the Continental Illinois National Bank to its cost
credit worthy borrowers of demand loans.
E. In the event the franchise is revoked or expires, the grantee shall file with the village, within thirty (30) days of such revocation or expiration, a statement
clearly showing the gross revenues received by grantee since the end of the previous fiscal quarter. The grantee shall pay the franchise fee due at the
time such statement is filed or within thirty (30) days, whichever is sooner. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; amd. Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.412: LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION:
A. The grantee shall save and hold the village, its corporate authorities, officers, boards, commissions, employees and agents harmless from any injury,
claim, demand, suit, judgment, execution liability, debt damages or penalty (hereinafter referred to as "claims") arising out of, resulting from, or alleged
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 62/724
to arise out of or result from, the construction, erection, installation, operation, maintenance of, or other activity connected with, the grantee's cable
television system, whether such acts or omissions are those of the grantee, whether or not any such act or omission is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this article of the grantee's franchise. These damages shall include, but not be limited to, penalties arising out of copyright infringements
and damages arising out of any failure by grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered
by the grantee's cable television system. The grantor shall give immediate written notice to the grantee of any "claim" or facts which might give rise to a
"claim" under this section. Said notice shall state particulars sufficient to identify the "claim" and shall contain reasonably obtainable information
respecting the time, place, and circumstances of the occurrence underlying the "claim" or potential "claim". The grantor shall immediately forward to the
grantee any demand, notice, summons, or other process received by it or its agents in connection with a "claim" described in this section. Further, the
grantor shall cooperate with the grantee and assist in the investigation of any "claim" and settle any "claim", and the right to enforce any right of
contribution or indemnity against any third party who may be liable to grantor or grantee because of any occurrence giving rise to a "claim".
B. The grantee shall pay and by its acceptance of a franchise shall be deemed to have specifically agreed that it will pay all expenses incurred by the
village in defending itself with regard to all claims mentioned in subsection A of this section. These expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses,
such as attorney fees, and shall also include the reasonable value to any services rendered by any employee of the village.
C. The grantee shall maintain at its own expense, and by its acceptance of a franchise shall be deemed to have specifically agreed that it will maintain
throughout the term of such franchise, comprehensive general liability insurance insuring the village and the grantee with regard to all claims
mentioned in subsection A of this section in the minimum amounts set forth in appendix A, division I of this code.
All policies of insurance required by this section shall be placed with companies which are qualified to write insurance in the state of Illinois by the
Illinois director of insurance and which maintain throughout the policy term a general rating of "A" and a financial size category of "XV" as determined
by the A.M. Best Company. No insurance policy which provides for a deductible in excess of the amount set forth in appendix A, division I of this code
shall be accepted to meet the requirements of this section.
D. The grantee shall maintain at its own expense and by its acceptance of a franchise shall be deemed to have specifically agreed that it will maintain
throughout the term of such franchise, a faithful performance, license and franchise bond or letter of credit, as specified in the franchise agreement,
running to the village, with at least two (2) good and sufficient sureties approved by the village, in the penal sum of as set forth in appendix A, division I
of this code, or such greater or lesser sum as may be specified in such franchise. When regular subscriber service is available to more than ninety
percent (90%) of the occupied dwelling units within the primary service area, as described in section 6.5.602 of this article, the amount of the bond or
letter of credit shall be reduced to the amount specified in the franchise, or if no amount is specified therein, then to the sum as set forth in appendix A,
division I of this code. Said bonds or letter of credit shall be conditioned that the grantee shall well and truly observe, fulfill, and perform each term and
condition of this article and its franchise and that in case of any breach of condition of the bond, or letter of credit, the amount thereof shall be
recoverable from the principal and sureties thereof by the village for all damages and costs, whether direct or indirect, resulting from the failure of the
grantee to well and faithfully observe and perform any provision of this article or its franchise. Such damages and costs shall be deemed to include, as
a minimum and without limitation any expenses as may be incurred by the village as a result of grantee's failure to comply with the obligations imposed
by this article and the franchise including, but not limited to, attorney fees and costs if any action or proceeding, the cost of refranchising, and the cost
of removal or abandonment of any property, or other costs which may be in default, which costs shall be conclusively presumed to amount to a sum
equal to at least the penal sum of such bond. The village shall have no obligation to devote the proceeds of such bond or letter of credit to the
completion, connection, operation or removal of grantee's cable television system, all of which shall remain the obligation of the grantee. The village's
right to recover under the bond or letter of credit shall be in addition to any other rights retained by the village under this article and other applicable
law.
E. In addition to the requirements of subsection D of this section, the grantee shall maintain at its own expense, and by its acceptance of a franchise be
deemed to have agreed that it will maintain on deposit with the village throughout the term of such franchise a cash escrow or a letter of credit as
specified in the franchise agreement, from an Illinois financial institution in the amount set forth in appendix A, division I of this code, or such greater or
lesser amount as may be specified in the franchise agreement. The form and content of such escrow or letter of credit shall be approved by the village
attorney. The escrow or letter of credit shall be conditioned in the same manner as the bond hereinabove required and may be drawn on by the village
to compensate itself for any of the damages or costs specified in subsection D of this section. In particular, but without limitation, such escrow or letter
of credit shall be drawn on in the case of any default or failure of the grantee to pay any fees, penalties, claims, liens or taxes due the village under
section 6.5.712 of this article or the franchise. Upon drawing on such escrow or letter of credit for any reason, the village shall notify the grantee. The
grantee shall, within three (3) days of the receipt of such notification, take all action required to restore the escrow or letter of credit to its original full
amount.
The rights reserved to the village with respect to the escrow or letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this
article or the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such escrow or letter of credit shall affect
any other right the village may have.
F. All insurance policies, bonds, escrows and letters of credit required by this section shall contain a provision requiring at least thirty (30) days' written
notice to both the village and the grantee of any cancellation, termination, or other expiration and shall provide that no such cancellation, termination or
expiration shall be effective prior to such notice. Each such policy, bond, escrow and letter of credit must be approved by the president and board of
trustees of the village and copies of such documents, along with written evidence of payment by the grantee of required premiums or fees shall be filed
and maintained with the village manager. Notices of renewal of any expiring policy or bond shall be filed with the village manager at least sixty (60)
days prior to the date of such expiration.
G. If the grantee proposes to secure a new insurance policy, bond or letter of credit instead of renewing an existing policy, bond or letter of credit, the
grantee shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of any such existing insurance policy, bond or letter of credit, submit to the president
and board of trustees of the village a copy of the proposed new policy, bond or letter of credit, and such proposed new policy, bond or letter of credit
shall become effective only upon the expiration date of such expiring policy, bond or letter of credit if the president and board of trustees of the village
have approved the terms and coverage of the said proposed new policy, bond or letter of credit. The grantee shall comply with all applicable provisions
of this section as to any such new policy, bond or letter of credit. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; amd. Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996; Ord. 5189, 5-15-2001)

1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 63/724
A. A franchise granted under this article shall be a privilege to be held personally in trust by the grantee. Except as otherwise provided in the franchise
agreement, the franchise shall not be assigned, transferred, mortgaged, leased or sublet, sold or disposed of, transferred in trust, pledged, in whole or
in part, by voluntary sale, merger, sale and leaseback, consolidation or otherwise or by forced or involuntary sale, without prior consent of the village
expressed by resolution and then on only such conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any sale, transfer or assignment not made according to the
procedures set forth in this article shall render the franchise void. The sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of the major part of the tangible assets of the
grantee shall be considered an assignment and shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
B. Any sale, transfer or assignment authorized by the village shall be made by a bill of sale or similar document, an executed copy of which shall be filed
with the village within thirty (30) days after such sale, transfer or assignment. The village shall not withhold its consent unreasonably; provided,
however, the proposed assignee agrees to comply with all the provisions of this article and the franchise and reasonably amendments thereto, and
must at a minimum, satisfy the legal, financial, technical and character qualifications required by section 6.5.302 of this article.
C. Prior approval of the village shall be required where ownership or control of more than twenty percent (20%) of the right of control of the grantee is
acquired during the term of the franchise in any transaction or series of transactions by a person or group of persons acting in concern, none of whom
owned or controlled twenty percent (20%) or more of such right of control, singularly or collectively on the effective date of the franchise. By its
acceptance of this franchise, the grantee specifically grants and agrees that any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the village shall
render the franchise void.
D. The consent of the village to any sale, transfer lease, trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation shall not constitute a waiver or release of any
of the rights of the village under this article and the franchise. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; amd. Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.501: SUBSCRIBER AND USER FEES:
A. By accepting a franchise granted pursuant to the terms and conditions imposed by this article, the grantee agrees that the village shall have the
authority and right to cause the grantee's fees for regular subscriber service, and all other subscriber and user services to the extent permitted by law
or FCC rules and regulations, to conform to the provisions contained herein. The village shall also have the authority and right to fix fees and to deny
increases or order reduction of fees when it determines that in the absence of such action on its part, the grantee's fees or proposed fees do not
conform to the stipulations contained herein.
B. All charges to subscribers and users shall be consistent with a schedule of fees for all services offered as established by the grantee. Changes in the
fee schedule shall not take effect until at least ninety (90) days after notification of same is delivered to the village and to current subscribers and users.
All charges to subscribers and users, and any proposed increase in such charges, shall be fair, reasonable and just and in no event shall any such
charge be greater than necessary to meet the costs of service (assuming efficient and economical management) and to provide a fair rate of return.
C. The grantee shall not, with regard to fees, discriminate or grant any preference or advantage to any person; provided, however, that the grantee may
establish different rates for different classes of subscribers or users based upon cost of service differentials; provided that the grantee not discriminate
between any subscribers or users of the same class.
D. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, and except in the case of extraordinary circumstances as approved by the village, the grantee shall not
increase the fees for services proposed in the franchise application above the rates specified in said application for a period of thirty six (36) months
from the time service is provided to the first subscriber pursuant to the grantee's franchise; provided, however, that the grantee shall have the authority
and the right to add to its service or installation fees any federal, state or local taxes or fees directly imposed on subscribers, and for any additional
copyright fees that may be imposed as a result of legislative or judicial action at the federal, state or local level taken after the filing of the franchise
application. If during the term of the franchise the grantee receives refunds of any copyright payments, it shall without delay notify the village, suggest a
plan for flow-through of the refunds to its subscribers, and retain such refunds in an interest bearing escrow account pending order of the village. After
considering the plan submitted by the grantee, the village shall order flow-through of the refunds with accrued interest to the grantee's subscribers in a
fair and equitable manner.
E. Notwithstanding subsections A through D of this section, no action shall be taken by the president and Board of Trustees of the Village with respect to
the grantee's rates, nor rules and regulations applicable thereto, until at least the expiration of thirty (30) months following the date service is provided
to the first subscriber under the franchise. At any time thereafter, the Board may, after proper notice as provided in Section 6.5.402 of this Article, hold
public hearings to consider the necessity of regulating the subscriber rates charged by the grantee, and may, following such hearings, establish
procedures for the review of subscriber and user rates and may order adjustments to such rates in accordance with the provisions of this Section;
provided, however, that this Section shall not permit the Village to order the grantee to rebate any fee or portion thereof charged during the period when
such fees were not subject to regulation by the Village.
F. The grantee shall be required to apprise in writing each new subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for providing cable television service.
G. The grantee may, at its own discretion, in a nondiscriminatory manner, waive, reduce or suspend connection fees or monthly service fees for
promotional purposes.
H. Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise, a subscriber shall have the right to have its service disconnected without charge, which shall
include the removal of any equipment owned by the grantee from the subscriber's residence. Such disconnection shall be made as soon as practicable
and in no case later than thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee of same. No grantee shall enter into any agreement with a subscriber
which imposes any charge following disconnection of service, except for reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those charges
shall be no greater than charges for new customers. This Section shall not prevent a grantee from refusing service to any person because the
grantee's prior accounts with that person remain due and owing.
I. Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise, a grantee may offer service which requires advance payment of periodic service charges for no
more than one year in advance subject to the conditions contained in this subsection. A subscriber shall have the right, at any time, to have its service

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 64/724
disconnected without charge and with a refund of unused service charges paid to the customer within thirty (30) days from the date of service. Rate
increases shall not be effective with respect to any subscriber until after the expiration of any period for which advance payment has been accepted by
the grantee. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)

applicable.
3. Capital expenditures, to include capitalized interest and overhead, if any.
4. Depreciation (straight line) expense, by category.
C. A grantee shall maintain such books and records for the franchise area specified in the franchise separately from any other operations; provided,
however, that any expenses or expenditures which apply to both the system in said franchise area and any other operations shall be reasonably
allocated between all such operations, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.
Such books and records shall be retained, in any reasonable form, for a period of not less than fifteen (15) years. The Village shall have the right to
extend the retention period through the term of any renewed franchise.
D. The books and records of the grantee's operation within the Village, which are required to be maintained pursuant to subsection B of this Section, shall
be made available in the grantee's local office during normal business hours, for inspection and audit by the Village within thirty (30) days after such
request has been made.

6.5.601: FRANCHISE AREAS:
A. Every application shall designate a proposed primary service area (PSA) and a proposed schedule for making service available throughout the PSA.
The boundaries of the primary service area shall be subject to approval by the Village, and shall be incorporated into the franchise granted pursuant to
this Article. If no PSA is specifically delineated in a franchise, the PSA shall be considered to be coterminous with the franchise area. If no schedule is
specified, service shall be made available throughout the entire PSA within twenty four (24) months of the effective date of the franchise.
B. Grantee shall furnish to the Village a map of suitable scale indicating the primary service area to be served and showing all roads and public buildings

6.5.602: EXTENSION OF SERVICE:
Following completion of construction within the PSA, each grantee shall extend its CATV System and make CATV service available beyond the PSA as
follows:

such street reaches a minimum density of fifty (50) dwelling units per street mile; and
B. Concurrently with the installation of utility lines to developing areas having a planned minimum density of fifty (50) dwelling units per street mile, which
lie contiguous to the boundary of the primary service area or at the end of any trunk or feeder line extensions beyond the primary service area.
C. The grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the Village than as required above, in
which case the grantee's application will be incorporated by reference in the franchise, and will be binding on the grantee. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord.
4787, 3-20-1996)

6.5.603: INDIVIDUAL SERVICE DROPS:
A. The grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to any isolated subscriber within or without the primary service area requesting
connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to such subscriber would require no more than a standard one hundred fifty foot (150')
aerial or buried drop line measured from the subscriber's property line nearest to a trunk or feeder cable required to be installed pursuant to Section
6.5.601 or 6.5.602 of this Article, to the subscriber's connection.
B. With respect to requests for connection requiring an aerial or buried drop line in excess of one hundred fifty feet (150'), grantee shall extend and make

distance exceeding one hundred fifty feet (150'). (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)
6.5.604: SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND SERVICE:
A. The cable television system to be installed by grantee shall comply in all respects with the requirements set forth in the FCC's "Rules for Cable
Television" including applicable amendments thereto; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the grantee from
proposing to comply with more rigid technical performance requirements, in which case the grantee's application shall be incorporated by reference in
the franchise and will be binding on the grantee. If the FCC should delete said requirements, the Village hereby reserves the right to amend this Article
to incorporate similar standards and every franchise granted pursuant to this Article shall be subject to such reserved power whether or not expressly
so conditioned.
B. Applications for franchise may include proposals for the provision of public, education, local government, and leased access channels. Such proposals
by a grantee, if accepted by the Village, shall be incorporated into the franchise granted. No such proposal shall be accepted unless it complies with
the following minimum requirements:
1. The grantee shall have available equipment for local production and presentation of cablecast programs other than automated services and shall
permit its use for the production and presentation of public access programs. The grantee shall not enter into any contract, arrangement, or lease for
use of its cablecast equipment which prevents or inhibits the use of such equipment for a substantial portion of time for public access programming.
2. The grantee shall have no control over the content of access cablecast programs; however, this limitation shall not prevent taking appropriate steps
to ensure compliance with the operating rules described herein. Failure to comply with such operating rules shall constitute a violation of this Article.
3. The public access channel(s) shall be made available to residents of the Village on a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis, consistent with
the goal of the maximum availability of access, free of charge. Charges for equipment, personnel, and production of public access programming shall
be reasonable and consistent with the goal of affording users a low-cost means of television access. The grantee shall adopt operating rules for the
public access channel(s), to be filed with the Village prior to the activation of the channel(s), designed to prohibit the presentation of: any advertising
material designed to promote the sale of commercial products or services (including advertising by or on behalf of candidates for public office); lottery
information; programming in violation of any Federal, State or local law, as well as rules requiring first-come, nondiscriminatory access, and rules
permitting public inspection of a complete record of the names and addresses of all persons or groups requesting access time. Such a record shall
be retained for a period of two (2) years.
4. The education access channel(s) shall be made available for the use of schools free of charge. The grantee shall adopt operating rules for the
education access channel(s), to be filed with the Village prior to activation of the channel(s), designed to prohibit the presentation of: any advertising
material designed to promote the sale of commercial products or services (including advertising by or on behalf of candidates for public office); lottery
information; programming in violation of any Federal, State or local law.
5. The local government access channel(s) shall be made available for the use of the Village or other such unit of local government as shall be
designated by the Village, free of charge.

users on at least one channel. The grantee shall adopt operating rules for the channel(s), to be filed with the Village Manager prior to activation
of the channel(s), designed to prohibit the presentation of: lottery information, to the extent such information is prohibited by State law; and obscene
or indecent matter and shall establish rules to this effect; and other rules requiring nondiscriminatory access, sponsorship identification, specifying an
appropriate rate schedule and permitting public inspection of a complete record of the names and addresses of all persons or groups requesting
time. Such a record shall be retained until the earliest scheduled performance evaluation session described in Section 6.5.404 of this Article or for a
longer period as determined by the Village.
C. The grantee shall provide, without charge within the primary service area, one service outlet activated for regular subscriber service to each fire station,
school, police station, public library, and such other buildings used for governmental purposes as may be designated in the franchise agreement;
provided, however, that if it is necessary to extend the grantee's trunk or feeder lines more than three hundred feet (300') solely to provide service to
any such school or public building the Village shall have the option either of paying the grantee's direct costs for such extension in excess of three
hundred feet (300'), or of releasing grantee from the obligation to provide service to such building. Furthermore, the grantee shall be permitted to
recover, from any public building owner entitled to free service, the direct cost of installing, when requested to do so, more than one outlet, or
concealed inside wiring, or a service outlet requiring more than three hundred feet (300') of drop cable; provided, however, that the grantee shall not
charge for the provision of regular subscriber service to the additional service outlets once installed.
D. The grantee shall not permit the transmission of any programming in violation of any Federal, State or local law. The grantee shall inform each
subscriber of the availability of a device capable of locking out any programming video and audio signals and shall provide such a device for each
outlet to any subscriber upon request at no additional charge. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)

all its parts shall be subject to inspection by the Village, and the Village hereby reserves the right to review the grantee's construction plans prior to the
commencement of construction. The Village shall not, however, be required to make inspections or approve the grantee's system and plans, and
specifically disclaims such obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps necessary to assure compliance with such laws and
regulations and the safety of its system as installed.

appropriate jurisdiction in matters affecting cable television operation or received from said agencies shall be furnished simultaneously to the Village by
the grantee.

performance tests shall be conducted by the grantee to demonstrate full compliance with the technical standards applicable pursuant to subsections
6.5.604A and 6.5.605C of this Article. Such tests shall be performed by, or under the supervision of, a qualified and independent registered
professional engineer or an engineer with proper training and experience. A copy of the report shall be submitted to the village manager, describing test
results, instrumentation, calibration, and test procedures, and the qualifications of the engineer responsible for the tests.
B. System monitor test points shall be established at or near the output of the last amplifier in the longest feeder line, at or near trunk line extremities, or at
the locations to be specified in the franchise. Such periodic tests shall be made at the test points as shall be required by the village or the agency.
C. At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the village may require additional reasonable tests, including full or partial repeat tests,
different test procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal, at the grantee's expense to the extent such tests may be performed by the
grantee's employees utilizing its existing facilities and equipment; provided, however, that the village reserves the right to conduct its own tests upon
reasonable notice to the grantee and if noncompliance is found, the expense thereof shall be borne by the grantee. The village will endeavor to arrange
its request for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the grantee or to the subscriber.
D. A copy of the annual performance tests report required by the federal communications commission shall be submitted to the village manager within
thirty (30) days of its completion.
E. The village shall have the right to employ qualified consultants if necessary or desirable to assist in the administration of this section, or any other
section of this article. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; amd. Ord. 4787, 3-20-1996)

6.5.608: STREET OCCUPANCY:
A. The grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different, or additional
poles, conduits, or other facilities whether on the public way or on privately owned property within the village until the written approval of the village,
and, if necessary, of the property owner is obtained. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by the municipality. No location of any pole, wire
holding structure or other facility of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles, structures and facilities shall be removed, relocated or
modified by the grantee at its own expenses whenever the village or other governmental authority determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby. Nothing herein or in any franchise shall be construed to entitle grantee to the use of any property other than the public way.
B. The village shall be entitled to make use of the grantee's poles and other wire holding structures so long as such use does not unreasonably interfere
with the grantee's operations.
C. Where a public utility serving the village desires to make use of the poles or other wire holding structures of the grantee but agreement therefor with the
grantee cannot be reached, the village may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the village shall
determine to be just and reasonable, if the village determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with
the grantee's operations.
D. All transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be installed and located in compliance with all applicable local ordinances and so as to cause
minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any public way and at all times shall be kept and
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

The grantee shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing
failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices
shall be used at such times and places as are required by applicable ordinances and at such additional times and places as are reasonably required for
the safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in any public way by the grantee shall be placed and maintained in such a
manner as not to interfere with the usual travel or other existing or projected uses of such public way. Unless expressly provided otherwise in the

construction activity in public ways.
E. The grantee shall remove, replace, or modify at its own expense, the installation of any of its facilities when directed to do so by the village.
F. All installations shall be underground in those areas of the village when public utilities providing both telephone and electric service are underground at
the time of installation. In areas where either telephone or electric facilities are aboveground at the time of installation, the grantee may install its
service aboveground, provided that at such time as those facilities are required to be placed underground by the village or are placed underground, the
grantee shall likewise place its services underground without additional cost to the village or to the individual subscriber so served within the village.
Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this article, the grantee's system shall be located underground at the request of the
adjacent property owner, provided that the excess cost over aerial location shall be borne by the property owner making the request.
G. In the event of disturbance of any public way, private property or improvement on either of them by the grantee, it shall, at its own expense and in a
manner approved by the village or other appropriate governmental authority and the owner, replace and restore such public way, private property or
improvement in as good a condition as before the work causing such disturbance was done. In the event the grantee fails to perform such replacement
or restoration the village or the owner shall have the right to do so at the sole expense of the grantee. Demand for payment to the village or owner for
such replacement or restoration shall be in writing.
H. Whenever, in case of emergency, it becomes necessary in the judgment of the village to remove or damage any of the grantee's facilities, no charge
shall be made by the grantee against the village for restoration and repair.
I. At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit issued by the village or other appropriate governmental authority and upon at least
forty eight (48) hours' notice, the grantee shall temporarily raise, lower, or cut its wires as may be necessary to facilitate such move. The direct expense
of such temporary changes, including standby time, shall be paid by the permit holder, and the grantee shall have the authority to require payment in
advance.
J. The grantee shall not cut or trim any tree, shrub or vegetation on public property without first obtaining written authorization from the village. Any such
work shall be done at the grantee's expense and shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the village. (Ord. 3120, 6-2-1981; amd. Ord. 4787,

licenses, permits and authorizations required for the conduct of its business, and shall submit monthly reports to the village manager's office on
progress in this respect until all such documents are in hand. Failure of the grantee to pursue all necessary steps to secure the aforementioned
authorizations with due diligence shall constitute a substantial violation of this article.

television service to subscribers. Said schedule shall be incorporated into the franchise and shall be enforceable as to the grantee under the provisions
of this article.

6.5.610: PROTECTION OF PRIVACY:
A. The grantee shall not permit the transmission of any signal, aural, visual or digital, including "polling" the channel selection, from any subscriber's
premises without first obtaining informed consent of the subscriber which shall not have been obtained from the subscriber as a condition of any
service for which transmission is not an essential element. The request for such consent shall be contained in a separate document, which specifically
enumerates and describes the transmissions being authorized and includes a prominent statement that the subscriber is authorizing the permission in
full knowledge of its provision and shall be revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever. This provision is not
intended to prohibit the use or transmission of signals useful only for the control or measurement of system performance or used for billing subscribers.
B. The grantee shall not permit the installation of any special terminal equipment in any subscriber's premises that will permit transmission from
subscriber's premises of two-way services utilizing aural, visual or digital signals without first obtaining written permission of the subscriber as provided

with all other CATV systems in adjacent areas.
B. Upon receiving an order to interconnect, the grantee shall make a good-faith effort to obtain agreements for the sharing of interconnection costs among
all interconnecting companies. The village may extend the time to interconnect or may rescind its order to interconnect upon finding that the grantee
has made a good-faith effort but has been unable to obtain a reasonable interconnection agreement or that the cost of the interconnection would cause
an unreasonable increase in subscriber rates.
C. Each grantee shall cooperate with any entity established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of CATV
systems.
D. The village may require a grantee to provide local origination equipment that is compatible with that used by other CATV systems within the adjacent

franchise because of the village's granting or enforcement thereof nor for the village's failure to have authority to grant the franchise. The grantee
expressly agrees that upon its acceptance of the franchise, it does so relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority

reports of such audits shall be filed in the public records of the village. The power with respect to such audits by the president and board of trustees shall

8.115: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:
A. Declaration Of Policy: The proper operation of government requires that all officials, elected, appointed and salaried employees, hereinafter referred to
as village officials, be independent and impartial; that government decisions and policy be made and carried out in the proper channels of the
government structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. The
attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists, or appears to exist, an actual or potential conflict between the private
interests of a government official and his duties as an official. The public interest requires, therefore, that the law protect against such conflicts of
interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to conduct in situations where actual or potential conflicts exist.
1. Public officials are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public; they are bound to uphold the constitution of the United States
and the constitution of the state of Illinois and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and village, thus fostering respect for all
government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office
regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official and
private affairs should be above reproach.
2. All officials of the village shall not exceed their authority, or breach the law or ask others to do so.
B. Nonpartisan Organization:
1. No public official, whether elected or appointed, shall promise an appointment to any salaried municipal position as a reward for any political activity.
2. No public official, whether elected or appointed, shall cause any other village employee to contribute to, or perform work for any political party as a
condition of continued employment.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 90/724
C. Public Property: No public official shall request or permit the use of village owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience
or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally, or are provided as municipal policy for use of such public official in the
conduct of official business.
D. Gifts, Favors Or Other Considerations: No public official or his/her immediate family shall accept any gift, favor or consideration, from any person which
the official knows is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the village, nor shall such public official:
1. Accept any gift, favor or other consideration of value that may tend to influence the official in the discharge of his or her duties; or
2. Grant in the discharge of his or her duties any improper favor, service or thing of value.
E. Official Activity:
1. Self-Dealing: A public official shall not enter into any business arrangement with the village (other than the job to which the official was appointed or
elected) whereby the person receives any kind of compensation or consideration. This shall apply whether the business arrangement is in the name
of the public official or in the name of a business entity in or by which the public official has an ownership or equity interest or is employed in a
managerial or supervisory capacity.
The foregoing shall not apply in the following circumstances:
a. The public official makes full public disclosure of the nature of the business relationship and refrains from acting or voting on the issue; and
b. The equity interest is in a company whose securities are traded on a national exchange and is less than one percent (1%) or the person will have
no managerial or other authority with respect to the transaction.
2. Spouse Or Dependent Child As An Employee: If the spouse or a dependent child of a village employee is employed by a business entity applying for
zoning, licensing or permit consideration from the village, the village employee shall make written disclosure to the mayor and board of trustees of
the employment relationship of the spouse or dependent child prior to the village taking any action with respect to the application.
3. Agency Representation: No such public official may represent, either as agent or otherwise, any person, association, trust or corporation, with
respect to any application or bid for any contract, work or other consideration from the village in regard to which such official may be called upon to
act or vote.
4. Public Official's Own Home, Property Or Business: Nothing in this section shall prevent a public official from seeking, through the appropriate
process, any otherwise lawful zoning, licensing or permitting consideration from the village for the official's own home, property or business.
Any contract made or procured in violation of this subsection E shall be void.
F. Disclosure Statements:
1. All public officials shall file with the village clerk each year a disclosure statement.
2. The disclosure statement required above shall be completed on forms provided by the village clerk and shall be filed pursuant to the following
schedule:
a. Any person appointed as a public official shall file his or her disclosure statement prior to appointment, if required to do so by this article.
b. Any other public official, elected or appointed, shall file his or her disclosure statement annually on or before May 1.

his disclosure statement by sending him a duplicate original of the identification form filled out by the person examining his disclosure statement.

the Illinois state statutes.

improvements or extensions thereafter made. Such mortgage or deed of trust may contain such covenants and agreements to safeguard properly
the bonds as may be provided for in the ordinance authorizing such bonds and shall be executed in such manner as may be provided for in such

revenues is subordinate.

8.2102: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the administrative adjudication system of charges of code violations is to provide a procedure by which charges of code violations can be
equitably and efficiently adjudicated administratively by an administrative law judge. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006)
8.2103: JURISDICTION:
Those matters subject to the administrative adjudication system provided for by this article are charges of violation of any regulation of the village of Mount
Prospect, so long as the relief sought is not a penalty of incarceration or a total fine in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), excluding allowable
costs. The fifty thousand dollar ($50,000.00) limitation shall not apply to those cases brought to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and collected by
the village. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006)
8.2104: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS SUPERVISOR:
There is hereby established the office of administrative hearings. That office shall be directed by an administrative hearings supervisor, who shall be the
village manager, or his/her designee. The administrative hearings supervisor's function is to expedite the prosecution and/or correction of code violations
subject to the jurisdiction of the administrative adjudication system. The administrative hearings supervisor is authorized to manage the administrative
adjudication process in the manner provided for in this article, which shall include determining the qualifications of administrative law judges, appointing
administrative law judges, and establishing such rules and regulations, as may be necessary for the effective operation of the administrative adjudication
system. The village manager may also appoint other persons to assist with the administrative adjudication system provided for in this article. (Ord. 5537, 1-

A. Hearing testimony and accepting evidence that is relevant to the existence of the code violation.
B. Administering oaths and affirmations to witnesses.
C. At the request of any party or on the administrative law judge's own motion, issuing subpoenas for the attendance of relevant witnesses and/or the
production of relevant books, records, or other information. Subpoena issuance shall be at the discretion of the administrative law judge, where it is
determined that the requested witness or document is material to the defense of the allegations and does not constitute a needless presentation and
that the elements of the defense sought to be proved could not otherwise be established without the production of the requested evidence.
D. Preserving the record of the hearing, including all exhibits and evidence admitted into the record at the hearing.
E. Issuing a determination based upon a review of the notice of violation, citation, other charging document (hereinafter "charging document") and on the
evidence admitted, which determination shall be final for purposes of judicial review under the Illinois administrative review act. The determination shall
be in writing, shall be signed by the administrative law judge, shall be designated as findings, decision, and order, and shall include the fine, penalty or
action with which the respondent must comply.
F. Upon finding a respondent liable for violating one or more charged code provisions:
1. Imposing penalties as provided by the governing penalty provision, except, however, that in no event shall an administrative law judge have authority
to: a) impose a penalty of incarceration, or b) impose a fine in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), excluding allowable costs. When
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 126/724
applicable, each day a code provision is found to have been violated by the respondent shall constitute a separate offense, and each separate
offense subjects the respondent to the penalty provided by the governing penalty provision.
2. Imposing, in addition to fines, administrative and/or enforcement costs and, when applicable, imposing costs incurred by the village for effecting
compliance with code provision(s) for which a respondent has been found liable.
3. Ordering, notwithstanding fines imposed or costs assessed, the respondent to comply with code provision(s) found to have been violated, and, if
appropriate, ordering the respondent to post a compliance bond as provided by subsection 8.2111B of this article.
4. Ordering, regardless of fines imposed or costs assessed, the respondent to perform a term of community service and/or participation in any training,
program or certification provided under section 23.1814, "Crime Free Housing", of this code.
G. Adhering to the policies, procedures, and legislation set forth in this code, except where discretion is specifically vested in the administrative law judge.
However, an administrative law judge is authorized to waive the fine and/or costs that otherwise would be imposed upon finding a respondent liable for
one or more code violations when the administrative law judge specifically finds as a matter of fact that the violation(s) occurred under such
circumstances that, as a reasonable person, would constitute an excuse for the violation(s).
H. Asking questions of the parties and witnesses, if necessary, to ensure the clarity and completeness of the testimony and the record.
I. Regulating the course of the hearing in accordance with this article, the rules adopted by the administrative hearings supervisor for the conduct of

administrative law judge who is charged with providing the parties a full and fair opportunity to be heard.
B. The village shall not be represented by an employee or other representative of the office of administrative hearings. However, documentary evidence,
prepared by another department of the village and submitted to the administrative law judge, may be presented at the hearing by the administrative
hearings supervisor.
C. All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for hearing. In rare instances and for good cause shown, a continuance may be granted
at the discretion of the administrative law judge. The purpose of administrative hearings is to provide a prompt resolution of alleged code violations.
Accordingly, the request for, and the grant of, continuances shall be curtailed to the extent fairness permits. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for
a continuance. Continuances shall not be granted for more than two (2) months.
D. The administrative law judge may issue subpoenas.
E. The formal and technical rules of evidence may be waived in the conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is of a
type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.
F. The administrative law judge shall permit persons to contest the merits of an alleged vehicular violation subject to the administrative adjudication
procedures of this article without attending a hearing. Any person, who wishes to contest a vehicular violation, must file a notarized statement of facts
specifying grounds for contesting the violation notice, which must be filed with the office of administrative hearings, postmarked within ten (10) days of
the issuance of the notice of violation. The request shall be deemed filed, if postmarked by such due date. The submission of a notarized statement of
facts is a waiver of the person's right to a personal appearance and the administrative law judge will make his/her decision based upon the notarized
statement of facts submitted by the person and the facts contained in the notice of violation(s).
G. No violation may be established except upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the original or a legible copy of the charging
document, issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of this code, shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts specified in the
document.
H. The administrative hearings supervisor shall determine the manner in which the record shall be preserved. Such preservation may be made by tape
recording or other appropriate means. Recording by any means by any member of the public is prohibited unless expressly authorized by the
administrative hearings supervisor. The record of all hearings before an administrative law judge shall include a copy of the findings, decision, and
order of the administrative law judge's final determination.
I. At the conclusion of a hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue his/her final determination. If the administrative law judge issues a final
determination of liability, he or she may impose fines, assess costs, and make orders, all as provided by subsection 8.2106F of this article, and as are
consistent with the specific code provision(s) found to have been violated.
J. At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall inform the parties orally and in writing of his determination. Such determination shall
constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review and is subject to review under the Illinois administrative review act. Based on the
charging document and the evidence admitted, the administrative law judge may issue the following determinations: liable, not liable, or liable upon a
plea of no contest. The administrative law judge also may dismiss the case with or without prejudice or grant a properly made motion by the village
voluntarily dismissing the case. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006)

by this article and applicable to the violation. The order shall advise the respondent of the procedure for setting aside the default judgment and shall
also apprise the respondent of the availability of an appeal of the default judgment to the circuit court of Cook County. The default judgment shall be
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 128/724
mailed promptly to the respondent as provided by subsection 8.2108C2 of this article. The default judgment constitutes a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and is subject to review under the Illinois administrative review act.
B. A respondent against whom a default judgment has been entered may file a motion with the office of administrative hearings to set aside the default
judgment and request a new hearing. A motion to set aside a default judgment may be filed at any time if the respondent alleges lack of subject matter
or personal jurisdiction. In all other cases, the motion must be filed within twenty one (21) days of entry of the default judgment. A motion to set aside a
default judgment shall set forth the reason(s) the respondent failed to appear on the original hearing date. The administrative law judge shall hear and

security bond to ensure respondent's timely compliance. Any noncash security bond shall name the village as beneficiary and shall be in the amount
specified by the administrative law judge. Any bond issued as a result of an administrative law judge's order is subject to review and approval by the
village manager. If the respondent fails to timely remedy the code violation(s) for which a bond has been issued and the village undertakes remediation
or otherwise expends funds related to the code violation(s), the administrative law judge, after giving the parties notice and opportunity to be heard,
may issue an order permitting the village to draw against the bond in an appropriate amount. The administrative law judge shall order the bond amount,
less the reasonable costs incurred by the village, returned to the respondent upon proof of compliance. Upon failure to achieve compliance, the
administrative law judge shall, upon written petition of the village, increase the assessed fine by ten percent (10%) for each day beyond the original
compliance date that compliance has not been achieved.
C. Nothing in this article shall prevent the director from issuing citations which are payable to the village without a hearing. However, in such instances the
fine may not exceed the amount set forth in appendix A, division III of this code. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006)
8.2112: ENFORCEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S ORDER:
A. Any fine and any administrative, enforcement, or compliance costs imposed by an administrative law judge's order that remain unpaid after the
exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be a debt due and owing
the village and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
B. After the expiration of the period for which judicial review may be sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the determination of liability
of an administrative law judge may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. At such time, the
administrative hearings supervisor shall send a notice of final determination of liability to respondent.
C. Any fine, penalty, and/or cost remaining unpaid after the notice of final determination of liability is sent shall constitute a debt due and owing the village.
Failure of the respondent to pay such fine or penalty within fourteen (14) days of the notice may result in a lien against the respondent's real estate or
personal estate (and foreclosure of such a lien) or such other remedies as may be available by law, including the denial of the issuance or renewal of
licenses or permits pursuant to section 10.302 of this code.
D. In any case in which a respondent fails to comply with an administrative law judge's order to correct a code violation, any expenses incurred by the
village to enforce the administrative law judge's order, including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court costs and costs related to property demolition or
foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing the village. Prior to any expenses being fixed by an administrative law judge pursuant to this subsection, the
respondent shall be provided with notice that directs the respondent to appear at a hearing before an administrative law judge to determine whether the
respondent has failed to comply with the administrative law judge's order. The notice shall set the place and the time for the hearing, which shall not be
less than seven (7) days from the date the notice is served. Notice may be served by first class mail or by an overnight or two (2) day commercial
delivery service and the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the date that the notice was personally served, deposited in the mail or placed with
the overnight or commercial delivery service.
E. Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from enforcing or seeking to enforce any order of an administrative law judge in any manner provided by
law. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006; amd. Ord. 5807, 8-3-2010)
8.2113: ELECTION OF REMEDIES:
In no case may an administrative law judge conduct an adjudicatory hearing for an alleged code violation where the remedy is a punishment of
imprisonment.
Nothing in this article, however, shall preclude the village from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate any ordinance violation or an
ordinance violation, which provides the remedy of imprisonment, or from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to impose the remedy of
imprisonment for failure to comply with an order of an administrative law judge. (Ord. 5537, 1-17-2006)

After December 1, 1992, no berming, planting of evergreens or shrubs, or placement of any objects on public property along a street shall be permitted,
except as authorized elsewhere in this code. It is recognized, however, that certain existing plantings and berms may be retained on public property. The
following regulations shall apply to those obstructions installed or constructed prior to, and which remain:
A. Sight Triangle Determined:
1. Stopping Sight Distance: Adequate visibility is to be provided along the approaches of two (2) streets at an intersection and across their included
corners for a distance sufficient to allow drivers, approaching simultaneously, to see each other in time to prevent a collision. Stopping sight distance
is the sum of the distance traversed by a vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied
and the distance required to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application begins. Factors include the vehicle speed, reaction time of the driver,
friction factor between tires and roadway, and grade of the roadway. The stopping sight distance shall meet the requirements of the following
equation:
SSD = 1.47*V*t + (V2)/[30(f.g)]
SSD = stopping sight distance, feet
V = vehicle speed, mph
t = reaction time, sec
f = friction factor
g = grade on the approach, decimal equivalent
The equation comes from "A Policy On Geometric Design Of Highways And Streets", AASHTO. Using the above equation, the following table depicts
stopping sight distances. Assumptions include t = 2.5 sec, f = 0.5, level terrain, eye height of 3.5 feet, object height of 4.25 feet, passenger cars only
and dry pavement. When able to be obtained, the vehicle speed shall be the measured 85th percentile speed. Else, the posted speed limit is to be
used.

Longer stopping sight distances may be required for locations which deviate from these assumptions. For special circumstances, the appropriate
stopping sight distance shall be determined using "A Policy On Geometric Design Of Highways And Streets" as a guideline along with the approval
of the director of public works.
2. Intersection Sight Distance: Adequate visibility is to be provided for a driver to make a safe departure from a stopped position on the minor street and
complete the turning maneuver onto or travel through the major street. Intersection sight distance is the distance measured along the major street of
the driver's visibility of traffic conditions along the major street when stopped on the minor street. The stop position of the driver is a point four feet
(4') behind the stop bar or four feet (4') behind the stop sign or closest traffic signal if a stop bar is not present. The intersection sight distance shall
meet those requirements shown on the following table:

50 840
55 990
The intersection sight distances are derived from "A Policy On Geometric Design Of Highways And Streets", AASHTO. Assumptions include level
terrain, two (2) lane major street, stop control on minor street, eye height of 3.5 feet, object height of 4.25 feet, passenger cars only and dry
pavement. When able to be obtained, the vehicle speed shall be the measured 85th percentile speed. Else, the posted speed limit is to be used.
Intersection sight distances shall be interpolated for speeds that are not indicated on the above table.
Longer intersection sight distances may be required for locations which deviate from these assumptions. For special circumstances, the
appropriate intersection sight distance shall be determined using "A Policy On Geometric Design Of Highways And Streets" as a guideline along
with the approval of the director of public works.
3. Sight Triangle: At an uncontrolled or yield controlled intersection, the legs of the triangle shall be the minimum stopping sight distance for each
street. The measurement along the street shall commence at the edge of the travel lane on the cross street closest to the approaching vehicle and
be measured along the center of the travel lane for which the stopping sight distance applies.
At a stop controlled or signalized intersection, the leg of the triangle along the major street shall be the minimum intersection sight distance. The
measurement along the major street shall commence at the edge of the travel lane on the minor street closest to the approaching vehicle and be
measured along the center of the travel lane for which the intersection sight distance applies. For multilane major streets, the through lane closest to
the centerline shall apply as the travel lane for approaching vehicles to the right of the minor street and the curb lane shall apply as the travel lane for
approaching vehicles to the left of the minor street. The leg of the triangle along the minor street shall be the distance from the edge of the travel lane
on the major street closest to the vehicle on the minor street to a point four feet (4') behind the stop bar or four feet (4') behind the stop sign or
closest traffic signal if a stop bar is not present. The measurement shall be made along the center of the travel lane on the minor street.
At the intersection of a street and driveway, the leg of the triangle along the major street shall be the minimum intersection sight distance. The
measurement along the street shall commence at the edge of the driveway closest to the approaching vehicle and be measured along the center of
the travel lane for which the intersection sight distance applies. For multilane streets, the through lane closest to the centerline shall apply as the
travel lane for approaching vehicles to the right of the driveway and the curb lane shall apply as the travel lane for approaching vehicles to the left of
the driveway. The leg of the triangle along the driveway shall be the distance from the edge of the travel lane on the street closest to the vehicle on
the driveway to a point ten feet (10') from the pavement edge of the street. The measurement shall be made along the center of the driveway.

4. Definitions: For the purposes of determining intersection sight distances and sight triangles, the following definitions shall apply:
MAJOR STREET: The cross street to a vehicle stopped at an intersection.
MINOR STREET: The roadway on which a vehicle is stopped at an intersection.
B. Sight Triangles Regulated: Within a sight triangle, the area from three feet (3') to six feet (6') above the top of the curb, or edge of the pavement on a
street with no curbs, shall be kept free and clear of any obstruction. A single stemmed tree shall be considered to be an obstruction only if its trunk, as
measured six inches (6") above the ground exceeds three inches (3") in diameter and the lowest growth from its branches is lower than six feet (6')
above the top of the curb or edge of the pavement.
An obstruction within a sight triangle that is identified by village staff or a resident as being unsafe shall be inspected by the director of public works
according to the standards in this section. If the director of public works determines that the planting or berm constitutes a sight obstruction, a written
order to prune or remove the obstruction shall be served on the property owner by regular mail. If the obstruction is not eliminated or an appeal filed
within thirty (30) days of such notice, the village reserves the right to cause such obstruction to be pruned, modified or removed and to bill the owner for
the cost of the work.
A property owner may appeal the order to prune or remove by filing with the director of public works a written request for review by the village
transportation safety commission. The request for review must be filed within thirty (30) days of mailing of the order. The decision of the transportation
safety commission shall be binding unless appealed to the president and board of trustees of the village by filing a written notice of appeal with the
village manager within fourteen (14) days of the transportation safety commission's decision.
In any hearing before the transportation safety commission or review by the president and board of trustees, it shall be the burden of the person
desiring to keep the planting, berm or object to prove by clear and convincing evidence that such does not constitute a sight obstruction.
The inquiry of the transportation safety commission and/or the president and board of trustees shall be limited to:
1. Whether the plantings or berms violate a regulation of article VII of this chapter; or
2. Whether the plantings, objects or berms actually limit the view of motorists, cyclists or pedestrians.
For regulatory purposes, the sight triangle shall not include private property.
C. Assumption Of Risk: Any berming or any planting or keeping of evergreen trees or shrubs, or objects on public property, a right of way or easement is
done at the risk of the adjacent property owner. The village shall not be responsible for the replacement of any planting or berm or repair of any object
of any kind or nature maintained by any person or private property owner within a public right of way or easement. Additionally, by the act of berming,
planting or keeping of evergreen trees or shrubs or placement of any object on public property the person so doing covenants and implies consent to
defend and hold the village harmless against any claims by any party for damages or injury that allegedly resulted from the evergreen trees, shrubs,
berms or objects. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5867, 7-19-2011)

This applies to the water service pipe located on the property owner's side of the B-box. The village may, in case of an emergency, repair any service
pipe and if this is done the cost of such repair work shall be repaid to the village by the owner of the premises served. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
9.409: WATER METERS:
A. Reading Meters:
1. The director of public works shall read or cause to be read every water meter used in the village at such times as are necessary that bills may be
sent out at the proper time.
2. Water bills shall include a notice that a monthly water meter reading is required. In the event that a water meter reading is not received by the
village's finance department at least five (5) days prior to the mailing date of a water bill, the director of finance shall establish an estimated meter
reading to be used for billing purposes based upon a like period during the preceding year or in such manner as the director may determine. In the
event that a meter reading is estimated for six (6) consecutive billing periods, the consumer shall be given at least ten (10) days' written notice of
intent to shut off the water service, the reason for the shutoff, and an opportunity to provide a water meter reading or request a hearing within the ten
(10) day period with respect to such meter reading before the village manager or finance director. If the village manager or finance director confirms
the shutoff, the consumer shall be allowed a reasonable period of time, not less than five (5) days, to provide the water meter reading prior to the
shutoff of service. Prior to shutting off the service, a red tag notice shall be posted at the premises warning that the service will be shut off. An
administrative fee, as set forth in appendix A, division II of this code, will be assessed upon the sending of the ten (10) day notice to compensate the
village for its administrative expenses, whether or not the service is actually shut off. Water service, which has been shut off, shall not be resumed
until the water meter reading is received.
3. Where a water meter is so located that it is not readily accessible to reading by village officials, or in the event any given user's water meter cannot
be read, the director of public works is hereby authorized to request in writing that the property owner, at the property owner's expense, remove any
obstruction within a time limit set by the director of public works.
4. The reading of the inside meter is the meter of record and prevails over all other readings.
B. Automated Meter Reading And Opt Out Policy: Mount Prospect is installing automated meter reading (AMR) technology throughout the village service
area in order to modernize its water billing services by installing a radio frequency (RF transmitter), referred to as an endpoint, in all residential
properties. AMR wirelessly delivers information to the village's water billing system, thereby eliminating the need for personnel to go to a residence to
make a water meter reading.
The village recognizes that some customers may want to opt out of having AMR technology installed inside their homes. The village shall offer

services, the water service may be shut off to the premises of such delinquent consumer. The consumer shall be given at least ten (10) days' written
notice of intent to shut off such service, the reason for the shutoff, and an opportunity to request and obtain a hearing with respect to such unpaid
charges before the village manager or finance director. If the village manager or finance director confirms the shutoff, the consumer shall be allowed a
reasonable period of time, not less than five (5) days, to pay the delinquent charges prior to the shutoff of services. Prior to shutting off the service, a
red tag notice shall be posted at the premises warning that the service will be shut off. An administrative fee, as set forth in appendix A, division II of
this code, will be assessed upon posting of the red tag notice to compensate the village for its collection expenses, whether or not the service is
actually shut off. Water service, which has been shut off, shall not be resumed until all bills, late charges and penalties have been paid, including the
administrative fee. It shall be the duty of the director of finance to enforce the provisions of this section whenever delinquency shall occur.

the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook County, Illinois, or in the office of the registrar of Torrens titles of Cook County, Illinois, the statement of
lien claim which shall contain a legal description of said premises, the amount of all unpaid charges for water and sewer service supplied thereto,
including connection and water meter repair or replacement cost, up to the date of filing such statement, the date when such amount became
delinquent, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges for water and sewer service to the premises
subsequent to the period covered by the bill. Said statement of lien claim shall be a sworn statement. If the user of water and sewer whose bill is
unpaid is not the owner of the premises, and the clerk has notice of this, then notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises, if his address is
known to the clerk, whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of sixty (60) days after it has been rendered. The failure of the clerk to record
such lien claim or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid water
and sewer bills as mentioned in this section.
2. The filing of any claim for lien under this section shall not be construed to limit the right and power of the village to enforce collection of the
delinquent water or sewer account against the consumer in any manner whatsoever.
3. Property subject to a lien for unpaid water or sewer charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by complaint for
foreclosure filed in the circuit court of Cook County in the name of the village.
The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings, in the name of the village, in any court having jurisdiction over

9.701: TITLE:
THE VILLAGE OF MOUNT PROSPECT URBAN FOREST PROTECTION AND PLANNING ORDINANCE. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
9.702: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The primary objective of the village government is to provide the citizens of Mount Prospect a safe, prosperous, and healthy community in which to live
and work. To consistently meet this objective requires the coordinated efforts of many individuals and municipal departments including those responsible
for maintaining the infrastructure of the village. Components of this infrastructure include streets, sidewalks, sewers, buildings and trees. Healthy trees are
unique in that they appreciate in value as they mature, unlike other components of the infrastructure that continually depreciate over time.
Trees provide a wide range of benefits to the village. Healthy trees reduce air and noise pollution, slow stormwater runoff, contribute to energy
conservation through shade and protection from the wind, and significantly increase property values. Trees need sufficient soil, water, and air to survive.
Protecting existing natural resources and planning for the establishment and care of new trees will enhance the economic and environmental health of the
village.
The purpose of this article is to promote and protect public health and safety by providing for the proper establishment of new trees, the protection and
maintenance of existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous or undesirable trees. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)

9.703: GOALS:
The provisions contained in the village of Mount Prospect urban forest protection and planning ordinance are designed to yield specific goals when
properly implemented. These goals include:
A. Maintain A Healthy Urban Forest: The urban forest of Mount Prospect is a dynamic ecosystem comprised of trees, soil, water, air, wildlife and humans.
Proper stewardship of the ecosystem is the most efficient and economical method of ensuring a safe and relatively hazard free environment for the
citizens of Mount Prospect.
B. Promote Age And Species Diversity Of The Tree Population: The long term health of Mount Prospect's urban forest depends on a proper distribution of
young, middle aged and mature trees. Adequate stocking of variously aged trees ensures that as mature trees decline and are removed, younger trees
are available to fill in the canopy. Species diversity is also important to guard against substantial losses to a species specific pest or disease, such as
Dutch elm disease.
C. Improve Species And Site Selection For New Tree Plantings: Increasing species diversity will only improve the urban forest if the species are matched
with the site in which they are growing. Large trees provide the greatest benefits relative to energy conservation, air quality and stormwater retention,
but require sufficient space to reach their full size at maturity. Large growing trees shall not be planted directly under existing power lines. Small trees
can be used in a variety of places that are size restricted, however, if a space will accommodate a tree that achieves a larger size at maturity, the larger
growing species should be considered. The proper tree should be located according to the conditions of the site with consideration given to increasing
canopy closure, maximizing environmental benefits and achieving consistency in the landscape design.
D. Establish Optimum Canopy Closure: Trees help to conserve energy by providing shade to buildings during the summer. Additional cooling can be
realized by shading roads and parking lots that would otherwise absorb sunlight and radiate heat. Since Mount Prospect is located in a climate where
considerably more energy is spent on heating than cooling, consideration must also be given to the effect of shade on heating costs in the winter.
Careful consideration of the establishment of new trees will result in the optimum canopy closure relative to energy conservation.
E. Resolution And Prevention Of Tree/Hardscape Conflicts Through Coordinated Planning: Trees require space for roots, trunk, and branches. Frequently
the space occupied by portions of trees is needed for other elements of the infrastructure such as roads, sewers, utility lines and buildings. Conflicts
between trees and other infrastructure components can be minimized through cooperation of the various village departments, local utility companies
and citizens. The provisions of this article are intended to facilitate communication and cooperation between those individuals and agencies charged
with maintaining Mount Prospect's infrastructure.
F. Promote Public Education And Support: The primary reason to care for trees and natural resources in Mount Prospect is to improve the community for
its citizens. The urban forest management program must be based on the informed support of the citizens. A goal of this article is to provide proper tree
care through informed, professional management based on knowledge. Those village employees responsible for the management of natural resources
in Mount Prospect are also responsible for sharing their knowledge and sources of information with the public.
G. Facilitate The Resolution Of Tree Related Conflicts: A goal of this article is to make available reasonable and fair guidelines for maintaining healthy,
structurally sound and safe trees, and providing a comprehensive standards manual for planting, pruning and removing trees. By providing these
guidelines in a clear and understandable format, equal and fair treatment is guaranteed for all residents. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
9.704: HOME RULE AUTHORITY AND SEVERABILITY:
It is the intent of this article to help coordinate the efforts of those responsible for the care of natural resources within Mount Prospect by promoting ideas
consistent with existing state and federal laws that may also be applicable. In the event that the provisions of this article conflict with the provisions of other
existing codes or ordinances, the guidelines put forward in this document shall prevail within the borders of the village.
Should any part or provision of this chapter be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the
ordinance as a whole or any part other than the part held to be invalid. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)

planting, maintenance and removal resides with the director of public works. The director of public works shall appoint a forestry/grounds superintendent.
The forestry/grounds superintendent through the authority of the director of public works shall have the authority to interpret and enforce the provisions of
this article. The director of public works may serve notice to any person in violation of the provisions of this article or initiate legal proceedings as may be
necessary. The forestry/grounds superintendent has the authority to revise and maintain the village Arboricultural Standards Manual. (Ord. 5819, 10-19-
2010)
9.707: POLICY TO TAKE OVER SOLE OWNERSHIP OF BOUNDARY TREES AS PUBLIC TREES:
Although boundary trees generally are, by operation of law, co-owned by the village and the private property owner abutting the public property or right of
way, it shall be the village's policy to take over, wherever possible, sole ownership and control of all boundary trees. Such policy shall be effectuated as
follows:
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 156/724
A. Where the village plants a tree solely on public property or right of way, all abutting private property owners are hereby put on notice that it is the
village's intent that all such trees remain the exclusive property of the village, even should such tree grow in such a way as to become a boundary tree.
B. In all other cases of boundary trees discovered by the village, the forestry/grounds superintendent shall send notices by certified and first class mail to
the abutting private property's: 1) current resident; and 2) owner, according to village records, which notices shall state that it is the village's intention to
take over sole ownership and responsibility of said boundary tree, and that the owner has sixty (60) days to object to such intention. If no objection is
made by the private property owner within the sixty (60) day period specified by the notice, the tree shall be presumed to be the sole property and
responsibility of the village and entered as such into the village's tree inventory. If the abutting property owner objects to the village's intention in writing
within sixty (60) days of date of the village's notice, said boundary tree shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the village and the private property owner,
remain the joint property of the private property owner and the village as provided by law. As such, the village will retain and assert its full rights to
prune such tree as relates to the need to keep public property and right of way unobstructed and safe. If the property owner objects to the village's
intention to take ownership of a boundary tree, the village may enter an agreement with the private property owner that such boundary tree shall be the
sole property and legal responsibility of the private property owner. Any such agreement entered into by the village shall be recorded with the Cook
County recorder's office and shall run with the land.
C. Nothing contained in this section is intended to in any way curtail or limit the village's rights under section 9.712, "Potentially Hazardous Trees And
Shrubs", of this article. (Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002)
9.708: APPEALS:
Any action or decision by the forestry/grounds superintendent pertaining to the enforcement of this article may be appealed to the director of public works.
An appeal must be filed in writing within thirty (30) days after the decision of the forestry/grounds superintendent. Only after the director of public works
issues a decision may the issue be further appealed to the village manager. An appeal to the village manager must be submitted in writing including the
reasons for the appeal within thirty (30) days after a decision has been rendered by the director of public works. The decision of the village manager shall
be final and will be mailed to the applicant and the director of public works. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002)
9.709: PLANTING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY:
A. Shrubs And Evergreen Trees: No shrubs or evergreen trees shall hereafter be planted on any right of way or easement along a street or any parkway
after December 1, 1992. An exemption from the shrub planting restriction may be granted by the director of public works in certain downtown areas
zoned B-5 or B-5C, when deemed necessary to provide suitable screening. This exemption shall be granted only when the director of public works has
accepted maintenance responsibility for such shrubbery, and said shrubbery will be maintained at a height of thirty six inches (36") or less if located
within a sight triangle.
B. Deciduous Trees:
1. Planting Permit Required: No tree of any kind shall be planted on public property, including, but not limited to, public streets and parkways, without a
permit. An application for such a permit, which shall be free of charge, shall be filed with the director of public works and shall contain at least the
following:
a. Name and address of applicant;
b. Address of property where the tree is proposed to be located;
c. A plan drawn to scale showing:
(1) The proposed location of each tree to be planted.
(2) The diameter (or caliper for trees less than 3 inches dbh) of each tree;
(3) The species of each tree.
2. Issuance Or Denial Of Permit: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a completed application for a tree planting permit, the director of public works
shall review the application for compliance with applicable village regulations. If the proposed planting does not so comply, the director of public
works shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for noncompliance.
3. Regulations Governing Tree Planting: All trees to be planted on public property shall be planted in accordance with the provisions outlined in the
current Arboricultural Standards Manual. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002; Ord. 5819, 10-19-2010)
9.710: PRUNING OF TREES:
A. Tree Pruning Permit: It shall be unlawful to prune or remove branches from any public tree without having first secured a permit therefor. Applications
for such permits or requests for exemption shall be made to the director of public works for approval before permission shall be granted. As a condition
of a contractor obtaining a tree pruning permit the applicant shall be required to carry public liability and property damage insurance in an amount to be
determined by the director of public works and proof of insurance coverage shall be filed with same. When advisable, the director of public works may
require the posting of a performance bond to guarantee the completion of any job in accordance with adopted village standards, rules and regulations.
B. Certified Arborist Required: When performing pruning on public trees, any tree service contractor performing work shall have on its staff an arborist
certified by the International Society Of Arboriculture. This arborist must oversee all pruning work and certify that all work meets the village's pruning
specifications as outlined in the village Arboricultural Standards Manual.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 157/724
C. Safety Standards: All tree service contractors pruning, maintaining or removing village trees must comply with safety requirements as specified in the
village Arboricultural Standards Manual.
D. Topping: It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person or firm to top any public tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes may
be exempted from this requirement as determined by the director of public works.
E. Pruning Standards: Trees are pruned to preserve their health and appearance and to make adjustments that will increase their longevity. Pruning will
reduce or eliminate hazards and can provide adequate clearance around utility lines. To achieve the objectives of extending the life of village trees,
reducing hazards, and providing appropriate utility line clearance, pruning must be conducted using sound arboricultural methods. The village shall
maintain pruning standards in the village Arboricultural Standards Manual.
F. Pruning American Elm Or Oak Trees: To help prevent the spread of Dutch elm disease and oak wilt, American elm or oak trees on public property shall
not be pruned during the growing season, except when, in the opinion of the director of public works, pruning is required to alleviate an imminent
hazard. Other exemptions from this requirement may be granted as deemed necessary by the director of public works.
G. Pruning Diseased Trees: All tools used on a public tree known to contain an infectious tree disease shall be properly disinfected immediately after
completing work on such a tree.
H. Utility Line Clearance Pruning: The village recognizes the need to maintain utility lines with regard to public safety and service. The village also
recognizes the benefits provided by healthy public trees. In the cases where public trees occupy space under or adjacent to overhead utility lines, the
need to maintain utility line clearance will be balanced with the need to maintain healthy trees by using proper arboricultural pruning techniques to
obtain the required clearance. Topping is not a proper arboricultural pruning technique and shall not be used in utility line clearance of public trees in
the village.
With the exception of emergency line clearance operations, companies or organizations owning utility lines in the village, or their line clearance
contractors, are required to notify the director of public works of scheduled public property pruning locations at least seven (7) days prior to, but no
more than ninety (90) days before, the commencement of pruning operations.
When necessary, as determined by the director of public works, a representative of the utility company, who shall be an arborist certified by the
International Society Of Arboriculture (ISA) or a degreed forester, will be required to meet with the director of public works to evaluate the impact of
pruning on specific public trees and to evaluate tree removals requested by the utility company. Joint agreement is required prior to all public tree
removals. Criteria to be considered in tree removals include potential hazards, tree health and species, damage from past maintenance, and tree
location.
Each parkway tree that is removed for the purpose of utility line clearance shall be replaced with one newly planted tree. The species selection for
replacement trees will consider the available growing space under or adjacent to utility lines and will use narrow crowned or low growing cultivars when
appropriate. When it is not practical to plant a replacement tree at the site of a tree removal, the replacement tree shall be planted in another public
location as identified by the director of public works. The utility company will reimburse the village for the cost of purchase and installation of
replacement trees, unless other arrangements have been agreed to in a franchise agreement.
Additionally, where line clearance pruning will be performed on private property, the utility company shall be required to provide advance written notice
within the above mentioned time frame to each individual property owner. Such notice shall be in the form of a door hanger or a mailing to each
property, and shall include a phone number where questions can be directed. Additionally, the scope of the work to be performed on private trees shall
be determined in advance of pruning by an ISA certified arborist or a degreed forester. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002)
9.711: REMOVAL OF TREES:
A. Tree Removal Permit: It shall be unlawful to remove or cut down any tree in any street, parkway or other public place without having first secured a
permit therefor. Applications for such permits shall be made to the director of public works for approval before permission shall be granted. As a
condition of a contractor obtaining a tree removal permit the applicant shall be required to carry public liability and property damage insurance in an
amount to be determined by the director of public works and proof of insurance coverage shall be filed with same. When advisable, the director of
public works may require the posting of a performance bond to guarantee the completion of any job in accordance with adopted village standards, rules
and regulations.
B. Issuance Or Denial Of Permit: Within ten (10) days after receipt of a completed application for a tree removal permit, the director of public works shall
review the application for compliance with applicable village regulations. If the proposed removal does not so comply, the director of public works shall
notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for noncompliance. Requests for tree removals will be reviewed on an individual basis. However, general
guidelines regarding acceptable and unacceptable reasons for tree removals are contained in the village "Arboricultural Standards Manual". Applicants
for tree removal permits are advised to review tree removal criteria prior to submitting a tree removal permit application.
C. Safety Standards: All tree service contractors pruning, maintaining or removing village trees must comply with safety requirements as specified in the
village "Arboricultural Standards Manual". (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002)
9.712: POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS TREES AND SHRUBS:
A. Any tree or shrub growing on private property which overhangs any sidewalk, street or other public place in the village in such a way as to impede or
interfere with traffic or travel on such public place shall be trimmed by the owner of the premises on which such tree or shrub grows so that the
obstruction shall be eliminated.
Within a sight triangle, the area from three feet (3') to six feet (6') above the top of the curb, or edge of the pavement on a street with no curbs, shall be
kept free and clear of any obstruction, including shrubs. A single stemmed tree shall be considered to be an obstruction only if its trunk, as measured
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 158/724
six inches (6") aboveground, exceeds three inches (3") in diameter and the lowest growth from its branches is lower than six feet (6') above the top of
the curb or edge of pavement.
Shrubs shall be kept entirely clear of sidewalks. Tree limbs shall not project over the sidewalk at a height of less than eight feet (8') above the sidewalk
or fourteen feet (14') above the street pavement. Owners of vegetation not maintained in the above manner shall be required to correct the violation
within thirty (30) days of being served by the village with a notice to do so. If the violation is not corrected within thirty (30) days, the village reserves the
right to cause the vegetation to be pruned or removed and to bill the owner for the cost of such work.
B. Any tree or portion of a tree growing on private property which has become likely to fall on or across any public way or place shall be removed by the
owner of the premises on which such tree grows or stands. Owners of vegetation not maintained in the above manner shall normally be required to
correct the violation within thirty (30) days of service of such notification from the director of public works. If the violation is not corrected within thirty
(30) days, the village reserves the right to cause the tree to be pruned or removed and to bill the owner for the cost of such work.
In the event that the risk of personal injury or property damage is imminent, the village reserves the right to act immediately to alleviate the imminent
hazard, and notify and bill the property owner thereafter. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5260, 6-18-2002)

between September 1 of any year and the following April 1, in which case it must be removed within thirty (30) days after notice has been given.
2. In the event that the director of public works receives proof that an infested ash or infected elm tree has been treated pursuant to section 9.715 of
this article, the director may extend the time limits set forth in subsection B1 of this section until such time as the director determines, in his/her
discretion and professional judgment, that the tree's condition is hazardous to users of the public right of way.
C. Breeding/Harboring Places Of Elm Bark Beetles Or EAB, Nuisance:
1. Elm and ash tree parts, in a dead or dying condition, including their logs and wood in wood piles, serve as a breeding or harboring place or places
for the elm bark beetle or EAB and are hereby declared public nuisances. It shall be unlawful for any person that owns or occupies property on which
any such tree parts, logs or wood in wood piles are located to permit the same to remain thereon after expiration of the time for removal described in
subsection B1 of this section.
2. It shall be a public nuisance for any person or company to sell or otherwise dispose of elm or ash logs within the corporate limits of the village. In the
event of such nuisance, that person or company shall be required to remove and properly dispose of the logs, at its own expense after expiration of
the time for removal described in subsection B1 of this section.
D. Enforcement And Inspection: The provisions of this section shall be enforced by the director of public works or his/her designee. The director of public
works is hereby authorized, after giving notice of the intent and purpose, to enter in or upon any property in the village, at all reasonable hours, for the
purpose of inspecting such property as the director of public works has reasonable cause to believe may contain diseased or infested trees or
breeding/harboring places of the elm bark beetle or EAB. The director of public works may remove from such trees or breeding/harboring places such
samples, borings or specimens as are required for the purpose of making a laboratory analysis to determine whether any tree located thereon is
infected with Dutch elm disease or is infested with EAB, or is a breeding/harboring place of the elm bark beetle or EAB. It shall be unlawful for any
person to prevent the director of public works from entering upon such property for the purpose of carrying out the duties specified hereunder or to
interfere with the director of public works in the performance of the lawful duties authorized under the provisions of this section.
E. Infested Ash Trees: For purposes of this article, ash trees within the village may, in the judgment of the village's forestry and grounds superintendent, be
considered infested with emerald ash borer if:
1. EAB insects in any stage of their life cycle are found in the tree or

after submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances,
and regulations. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-2007)
9.806: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
A. Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in
accordance with this article on rights of way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others
who may have an interest in the rights of way.
B. Duration: No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless construction is actually begun within that period and
is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
C. Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all
major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be
held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting
shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities,
use of rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
D. Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village, including the regulations described in article VII of this chapter, the "Arboricultural Standards Manual", and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-2007)

submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within ninety (90) days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the
locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for
variance in accordance with section 9.822 of this article. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility
from the right of way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-2007)
9.808: INSURANCE:
A. Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the right of way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and
naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in appendix A,
division I of this code.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
B. Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary
policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
C. Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the village within ten (10) days following receipt of a
written request therefor from the village.
D. Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
E. Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this section. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under
subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a private self-insurer under the workers' compensation act.
F. Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are
the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the

appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this article by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 5657, 11-
20-2007)
9.810: SECURITY:
A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform
or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to
the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as
good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security
fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single
phase.
D. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon
written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection C of this section.

security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved
by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right
the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights
which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-2007)

impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be based
upon the following considerations:
a. The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in the
event of damage to or failure of the facility;
b. The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway structure in the transportation system;
c. The alternative routings available to the utility and their comparative practicability;
d. The proposed method of attachment;
e. The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the proposed facility;
f. The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
g. The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
h. The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared to the risk involved.
I. Appearance Standards:
1. The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
2. A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right of
way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-

application package within three (3) business days of the verbal approval.
2. Protection For Traffic: If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard
does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means
of access to the facility is available.
3. Repairs Completed Rapidly: In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.
4. Procedure For Emergency Work Near Parkway Trees:
a. The utility shall obtain a permit for the emergency work within three (3) business days of a verbal permit approval.
b. All effort shall be made to adhere to the minimum required separation of any excavation from parkway trees. In the event that emergency work
cannot be completed without excavation in this area, the utility may proceed with the work. However, inspection by the forestry division of the
public works department shall be required prior to backfill of the top eighteen inches (18") of soil. The area shall be properly barricaded for safety
purposes until the area is backfilled.
c. If work is performed during normal business hours, the utility shall contact the forestry division for inspection of the tree prior to backfilling.
d. If work is performed after normal business hours, the utility shall contact the police department, which will contact an employee of the public works
department for inspection.
e. If the area is backfilled prior to inspection, the utility shall be required to reexcavate, in the presence of a forestry division inspector, for inspection.
f. After inspection of the excavated area, the forestry division will notify the utility of any steps that must be taken prior to backfilling. The utility shall
then repair all damaged roots and backfill the area within the three (3) days if the tree does not need to be removed.
5. Damage To Parkway Trees:
a. Repair of damaged tree roots is the responsibility of the utility. All roots greater than two inches (2") in diameter that are encountered during
excavation shall be cleanly cut, on the side attached to the tree, with a handsaw or other tool specifically designed to cut wood.
b. Damage to a tree's trunk and/or limbs will be repaired by the forestry division. The utility will be invoiced for this service at current village labor and
equipment rates.
c. If the forestry division determines that the tree must be removed, the village will remove and replace the tree and send an invoice to the utility for
this service. The invoice amount will be determined by multiplying the diameter of the tree (measured 41/2 feet above the ground) by one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) per inch.
d. If the forestry division determines that the required work could not have been completed without the destruction of the tree, the forestry division
may issue a permit authorizing removal of the tree, and the stump to a depth of twelve inches (12") below grade, to the utility at its expense. The
utility will have ten (10) business days to remove the tree. In this case, the utility will be invoiced for the full cost of a four inch (4") diameter
replacement tree (or a like size replacement tree if the destroyed tree is less than 4 inches in diameter).
e. No further permits will be issued to the utility until payment is received by the village for all such services. (Ord. 5657, 11-20-2007; amd. Ord. 5819,
10-19-2010)

works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons
why a variance should be granted.
B. Authority To Grant Variances: The director of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
C. Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The director of public works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated
that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship that
would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for authorizing a variance, the director of public works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out
the purposes of this article.
E. Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the director of public
works under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The

accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate
the interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to
establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the Village all information necessary to demonstrate its
efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited above. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the procedures for abatement of such nuisances set
forth in this Code.
B. Prohibited: A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any wireless facility that:
1. Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a right-of-way;
2. Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
3. Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
4. Violates or conflicts with article VIII, "Construction Of Utility Facilities In Public Rights-Of-Way", of this chapter, or other applicable regulations set
forth in this Code or otherwise adopted by the Village, except to the extent such chapters, section or regulations may be modified by the provisions of
this article; or
5. Violates the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC section 12101 et seq.).
C. Contractual Requirements: Wireless providers shall comply with all requirements imposed by a contract between the Village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
D. Ground-Mounted Equipment: Wireless providers shall comply with the ground mounted equipment spacing requirements within rights-of-way as set
forth in article VIII, "Construction Of Utility Facilities In Public Rights-Of-Way", of this chapter.

9.822 of this chapter, to allow a small wireless facility to be located above ground in an area where Village ordinances or regulations prohibit or
restrict above ground facilities if, in addition to demonstrating the conditions of section 9.822 of this chapter have been established, the wireless
provider can establish that:
a. Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-way; and
b. An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area; and
c. An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety hazard; and
d. An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies; and
e. Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the above ground wireless facility at the proposed location; and
f. An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not create a safety hazard; and

Such endangerment may include, but not be limited to, excessive noise by patrons while visiting the licensed premises, consumption of alcoholic
beverages in areas immediately adjacent to the licensed premises, littering or destruction of neighboring property by patrons, traffic violations by
patrons of the licensed premises, use of any illegal or controlled substance on or adjacent to the licensed premises, the necessity of police or other
village services at the licensed premises or the necessity of police services caused by patrons after being served alcoholic beverages at the licensed
premises.
No action may be taken against a licensee by the commissioner in circumstances described by this subsection F unless it is shown that the
commissioner or the village, by any of its various departments, has given the licensee written notice of the endangerment activities on at least two (2)
occasions, and, in the opinion of the commissioner, after a reasonable time period, such endangerment has not been sufficiently cured or remedied.
The power of the commissioner to act in those situations is a recognition of the principle that the holding of a liquor license is a special privilege and not
a right and that such a privilege, irrespective of the good intentions of the licensee, remains absolutely subordinate to the welfare of the community.

consumed on the premises by an underage person as set forth in subsection B of this section.

1. Intent And Applicability: The development and administration of this chapter is based upon the village being divided into zoning districts within which
the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures is substantially uniform. However, it is recognized that there are
certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular zoning district without consideration of the
impact of those uses upon adjoining properties and their impact on the neighborhood in general. Such conditional uses fall into two (2) categories:
a. Uses publicly operated or uses traditionally promoting a public interest or benefit.
b. Uses entirely private in character but of a nature that their operation may present a different impact upon adjoining properties or the neighborhood
in general.
2. Authority: Except as otherwise provided in section 14.316 of this chapter, the planning and zoning commission shall convene a public hearing on a
conditional use application. The planning and zoning commission shall prepare findings of fact based on evidence presented addressing required
standards, and submit a recommendation on an application to the village board for their review and final decision.
3. Initiation: Any person, firm, corporation, office or other legal entity having ownership interest in land, or a contractual interest that may become an
ownership interest, may file an application with the consent of the property owner.

community development department. The director shall, upon receiving a complete application for a conditional use, forward the application, along
with other data considered important by the director, to the planning and zoning commission for their review and recommendation to the village
board.
5. Public Hearings: A public hearing shall be conducted by the planning and zoning commission on the conditional use application. Notice shall be as
provided in subsection G of this section, and in compliance with state statutes.
6. Recommendation By The Planning And Zoning Commission: The director of community development shall submit the written recommendation of the
planning and zoning commission on an application for a conditional use to the village board within thirty (30) days of conclusion of the public hearing.
Extension of this time period may be allowed by mutual consent of the applicant and the director of community development.
7. Action By The Village Board:
a. The village board shall not act upon a proposed conditional use until it has received a written report and recommendation from the planning and
zoning commission provided by the director of community development.
b. The village board may approve a conditional use by ordinance, deny, or refer back to the planning and zoning commission for further review. The
village board may establish such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
conditional use, as is deemed necessary for the protection of adjoining properties and the neighborhood in general and the public interest.
c. In all cases where the village board permits a conditional use, the authorizing ordinance shall specifically set forth the terms for operation of the
conditional use.
d. Any conditional use which fails to receive a favorable recommendation from the planning and zoning commission shall not be granted by the
village board unless there is a concurring vote of five (5) if all seven (7) members of the corporate authorities are present and voting, and a
concurring vote of four (4) if less than seven (7) members of the corporate authorities are present and voting.
8. Standards: No conditional use shall be recommended for approval by the planning and zoning commission unless it finds:
a. That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, or general welfare;
b. That the conditional use will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood in which it is to be located;
c. That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
d. That adequate public utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or will be provided;
e. That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;
f. That the proposed conditional use is not contrary to the objectives of the current comprehensive plan for the village; and
g. That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified pursuant to the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission.
9. Conditions And Guarantees: In all cases where conditional uses are granted, and conditions regulating the use are established as described in
subsection F8 of this section the village board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditional
use complies with all regulating conditions.
10. Effect Of Denial Of Application: No application for a conditional use which has been denied by the village board shall be resubmitted for a period of
one year from the date of denial, except on the grounds of new factual evidence, or a change in conditions which would alter the concept or intent of
the request. Such changes may include reductions in density or building height, changes in land use and road standards and alignment, or
conditions which would have a positive effect on surrounding property, and serve to address the circumstances of the denial of the original
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 289/724
application. Such change or new evidence must be reviewed and acknowledged by the director of community development before a new application
can be submitted for a public hearing.
11. Revocation:
a. In any case where the construction of an approved conditional use is not substantially under way, or if a use is not established or commenced in
the building within one year from the date of granting thereof, and completed within eighteen (18) months, then, without further action by the village
board, the conditional use or authorization thereof shall be null and void.
b. A conditional use may be revoked if conditional use as established or constructed on the site does not conform to the established conditions for
approval. The director of community development will be responsible for advising the village board of any violations and the village board may then
authorize the planning and zoning commission to schedule a public hearing to consider revoking the conditional use permit. After conducting the
public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall then prepare a written report and recommendation to submit to the village board. Upon
receipt of the planning and zoning commission report, the village board shall then render a final judgment regarding rescinding the conditional use
permit and accompanying ordinance.
12. Expiration And Transferability: The conditional use shall expire if the conditional use shall cease for more than twelve (12) months for any reason.
However, the ownership of an authorized conditional use may be changed if the use remains unchanged.
13. Modification Or Intensification: Any modification or intensification of a conditional use which alters the essential character or operation of the use in
a way not intended at the time the conditional use was granted shall require a new conditional use permit. Such conditional use permit shall be
applied for prior to any modification of the use or property. The director of community development shall determine whether the proposed
modification or intensification represents an alteration in the essential character of the original conditional use as approved. The operator of the
conditional use shall provide the director of community development with all the necessary information related to the conditional use to render this
determination.
G. Public Hearing Procedures:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a variation, amendment, conditional use or appeal, the director of community development shall review the
application for completeness and assign a case number to the request.

on the premises shall report to work at or near the premises, either for work to be completed within the residence or to be dispatched to work at another
location. The purpose of this standard is to ensure that no nonresident comes to a dwelling for employment purposes, and to minimize the traffic
generated by the home occupation. No routine attendance of employees associated with any home occupation shall be allowed at the premises of the
home occupation. "Routine attendance" shall mean that the conduct of the home occupation requires nondomiciled persons to visit the premises of the
home occupation as part of the regular conduct of the occupation, without regard to the number, frequency or duration of such visits. This standard
shall apply irrespective of any business activity actually taking place at the dwelling unit.
F. No home occupation shall generate customer, client or group visits of a greater frequency than what would be expected in a residential area where no
home occupation exists. Any need for parking generated by a home occupation shall be provided on site and shall not exceed the required parking for
a dwelling unit. The purpose of this standard is to limit the frequency of customer or client visits to an amount that is not disruptive to a neighborhood
and eliminate congestion on public streets.
G. The home occupation shall not utilize more than twenty five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the dwelling unit. The purpose of this standard is to
assure that the home occupation remains incidental to the residential use of the structure.

1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 301/724
not be approved unless the applicant provides written proof that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower, structure, monopole that already exists within a one-fourth (1/4) mile radius of the proposed tower
for one or more of the following reasons:
a. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or structure, as certified by a qualified professional
engineer that is licensed in the State, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the
additional facility at a reasonable cost;
b. The planned equipment would cause interference materially affecting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or structures
as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
c. Existing or approved towers and structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably as certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer;
d. Other unforeseen reasons that make it not feasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
structure as certified by an appropriate professional.
2. Structure Design: Any proposed guyed, lattice, or monopole tower shall be designed structurally, electrically and, in all respects, to accommodate
both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2) additional users. Towers must be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
G. Design Criteria: Antennas mounted on water towers shall not extend more than ten feet (10') beyond the height of the water tower. All antennas, except
those mounted on monopoles, shall be designed to be compatible with neighboring buildings and uses, and shall match or blend with the structure to
which they are attached so the antenna is virtually invisible to the casual observer. Antennas installed on buildings shall not extend more than ten feet
(10') beyond the height of the structure and shall be painted to match the color of the building to which they are affixed. As such, monopoles and any
accompanying equipment shall be painted a uniform, neutral color. Towers may not display logos or company colors.
H. Screening: A combination of landscaping, berming, fences or other screening materials shall be utilized to maintain or enhance the existing character of
the property surrounding a personal wireless service and/or a small wireless facility. All structure bases shall be completely screened from view.
I. Abandoned Or Unused Facilities: Abandoned or unused facilities, towers, or portions of towers shall be removed as follows:
1. All shall be removed within six (6) months of cessation of use or of notifying the FCC of intent to cease operations at the site, whichever comes first,
unless a time extension is approved by the Community Development Director. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which require the
applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon cessation of operations at the site shall be submitted at the time of application. Any
tower and associated facilities not removed within six (6) months of the cessation of operations at a site shall be deemed a nuisance and may be
abated according to the nuisance provisions of this Code.
2. Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall be removed within two (2) months of the time of the abandonment of that portion
unless the Village has specifically designated that portion for future collocation.
J. Utility Buildings And Structures: All utility structures and structures accessory to a personal wireless service and/or a small wireless facility tower shall be
architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zoning
district. Ground mounted equipment shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation. The maximum height for an accessory utility structure is twelve
feet (12') and shall be no larger than six hundred (600) square feet.
K. Signs And Advertising: The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or equipment information is prohibited.
L. Temporary Facilities: Temporary personal wireless service facilities shall conform to all of the setback and yard requirements of the district in which they
are located. A temporary personal wireless service facility shall not exceed the height of the facility previously approved for the property, or one
hundred feet (100') in the case of a special event. Only one temporary personal wireless service facility will be allowed per site at any one time, unless
the approved facility on the subject site allows for collocation, in which case the permissible number of temporary facilities on that site shall be the
number approved for that facility. A temporary personal wireless service facility must be located behind the front plane of any principal structure that is
on the lot. A temporary personal wireless service facility may be allowed only in accordance with subsection E of this section.
A request for a temporary personal wireless service facility may be granted only by the Village Manager in such reasonable numbers and with such
reasonable conditions as the manager may deem appropriate. Any request for additional time beyond that set forth in this subsection L, shall be
subject to review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approval of the Village Board.
1. Special Events: Temporary personal wireless service facilities shall be permitted for each licensed carrier for special events (temporary sporting or
entertainment events) of a period of one week. No more than three (3) such promotions shall be allowed per carrier in a calendar year.
2. Repairs And Equipment Upgrading: If a permanent personal wireless service facility is under repair or equipment is being upgraded, a temporary
facility shall be permitted for each licensed provider for a period of up to ninety (90) days. The owner of the facility must certify in writing the necessity
for the repair or equipment upgrade.
M. Insurance: The provider must tender to the Community Development Director on an annual basis, proof of public liability insurance covering the facility
in an amount not less than as set forth in appendix A, division I of this Code.
N. Compliance: All personal wireless service and/or small wireless facilities must maintain compliance with the approved plans and specifications. If the
personal wireless service and/or a small wireless facility becomes noncompliant with approved plans and specifications due to, but not limited to:
discoloration, cracking, missing components, rusting, settling, damage or general disrepair; then the owners of the personal wireless service and/or a
small wireless facility and the owner of the structure or lot on which the personal wireless service and/or a small wireless facility is located will be jointly
and severally responsible for remedying the specific nonconformities. These nonconformities must be remedied within forty five (45) days after written
notice, detailing these nonconformities, sent by the Village to the owner of the personal wireless service and/or a small wireless facility and the owner
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

14.317: ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES:
The Village of Mount Prospect is committed to encouraging the use of environmentally sensitive development techniques in order to improve the quality of
life and environmental health of the community as a whole. Green building design is a technique which incorporates design principles and strategies that
limit the energy demands of buildings and also create healthier living environments within them. Green building techniques may include, but are not limited
to, green roofs, reflective white roofs, permeable paving, stormwater harvesting, use of landscaping to reduce thermal demand, and use of reusable
energy sources. This section provides direction on common green building design practices. While not a comprehensive list of all potential green
initiatives, the Village encourages property owners to follow green design principles.
A. Wind Energy Conversion Systems: The Village of Mount Prospect has found wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to be a viable and useful
method of localized energy generation. Conditional use permits to authorize WECS are allowed in all zoning districts. Due to the specialization and
technical nature of WECS, the following criteria have been established as minimum standards for the recommendation and approval of such permits.
1. No more than one WECS shall be permitted per zoning lot. More than one WECS may be permitted for commercial and industrial properties, subject
to the approval of the village board.
2. Rooftop mounted WECS:
a. Shall be set back at least twenty feet (20') from front or exterior building lines, and at least ten feet (10') from side building lines. Setbacks shall be
measured to the widest point of blade rotation or to the side of the WECS, whichever is greater.
b. Shall be limited to a height of no more than fifteen feet (15') above the roof peak or top of a parapet wall, whichever is greater. Total height shall be
measured from the highest point of blade rotation or the highest point of the WECS, whichever is greater.
c. Shall comply with all noise regulations of the Village of Mount Prospect.
d. Shall be safely and securely attached to the rooftop in compliance with the Village of Mount Prospect building code.
3. Tower mounted WECS:
a. Shall not be permitted in single-family residential districts.

located or be set back a distance equal to 1.1 times the total height of the structure from any property line, whichever distance is greater. Total
structure height shall be measured from the highest point of blade rotation to the ground.
c. A WECS tower shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet (20') from any principal structure on the property.
d. The maximum permissible height of a WECS tower shall not exceed eighty feet (80').
e. Rotor blades or airfoils must maintain at least twelve feet (12') of clearance between their lowest point of rotation and the ground.
f. All climbing apparatus affixed to a WECS tower shall terminate twelve feet (12') short of ground level.
g. All WECS facilities shall be enclosed within a building or surrounded by a six foot (6') high safety fence.
h. All WECS towers shall be constructed with an approved concrete foundation.
4. All WECS structures, including roof mounted, towers, and accessory buildings, shall conform to the appropriate village related rules and regulations
pertaining to their construction, design, operation and maintenance.
5. WECS shall be designed to withstand a minimum wind velocity of one hundred (100) miles per hour, with an impact pressure of forty (40) pounds per
square foot.

6. The applicant shall submit documentation that the proposed WECS will not create a nuisance to adjacent uses. In no event shall the noise level
produced by a WECS continuously exceed sixty five (65) decibels as measured at the property line.
7. No WECS shall cause electromagnetic degradation in performance of other electromagnetic radiators, receptors, or generators of quality and proper
design. The Village reserves the right to revoke any conditional use permit for a WECS system whenever electromagnetic interference from the
WECS is evident and cannot be corrected.
8. WECS shall not be artificially lighted, except to the extent required by the FAA or other applicable government authority.
9. All wind turbines shall have an automatic braking, governing or feathering system to prevent uncontrolled rotation, overspeeding and excessive
pressure on the tower structure, rotor blades and turbine components.
B. Solar Energy Conversion Systems: The Village of Mount Prospect has found solar energy conversion systems (SECS) to be a viable and useful method
of localized energy generation. SECS shall be permitted in all zoning districts in accordance with the following minimum standards:

Article IV
NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES
14.401: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses, and to specify those circumstances and
conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses shall be permitted to continue. (Ord. 4590, 9-21-1993)
14.402: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES:
Buildings and structures which do not conform to the bulk regulations of any zoning district or any other provision of this chapter shall be subject to the
following regulations:
A. Ability To Continue Nonconforming Building Or Structure: Any lawfully established nonconforming building or structure which is devoted to a permitted
use in a zoning district may continue to be used for any permitted use.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 309/724
B. Enlargement, Repair, Alterations And Replacement: Any nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or altered, provided
that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or increase the extent of the existing
nonconformity. However, on lots fifty five feet (55') or less in width, a nonconforming building or structure may be extended within the established
setback in a required rear yard or side yard, provided that such nonconformity is no more than fifty percent (50%) of the required setback.
Existing nonconforming structures which do not conform to the required building setbacks may be enlarged by creating a second story, provided the
existing nonconforming setback for the structure is maintained and the proposed enlargement meets other applicable zoning requirements.
In residential zoning districts, existing nonconforming driveways, patios and sidewalks may be replaced in the same location without complying with the
bulk regulations of this chapter. However, if such driveways, patios, and/or sidewalks are replaced with a different structure, any such replacement
structure must meet applicable lot coverage requirements. For instance, a nonconforming patio can be replaced with another patio surface but it cannot
be replaced with a driveway, deck, or other structure without meeting lot coverage requirements.
C. Damage Or Destruction: In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the replacement value of such building or structure, such building or structure shall not be rebuilt or restored unless it conforms to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
When such building or structure is damaged by any means to less than fifty percent (50%) of replacement value, such building or structure may be
reconstructed or repaired, provided that such repair or restoration begins and is pursued to completion within one year of the date of such damage. Any
such repair or restoration shall be done in compliance with current building codes. (Ord. 4590, 9-21-1993; amd. Ord. 4678, 10-4-1994; Ord. 5751, 8-4-
2009)
14.403: NONCONFORMING USES:
A use in a building, structure, or on vacant land, which is not a permitted use in the zoning district in which the use is located, shall be considered a
nonconforming use and subject to the provisions below:
A. Ability To Continue Nonconforming Use: Any existing nonconforming use of part or all of a building, structure or nonconforming use of land, may be
continued as long as it meets the requirements of this section.
B. Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use. Any
such repair or maintenance shall be done in compliance with current building codes.
C. Expansion: A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in intensity in any building or structure.
D. Relocation: No building or structure that is occupied in whole or in part by a nonconforming use shall be relocated to any other location unless the entire
building or structure and the use thereof shall conform to all regulations in the zoning district.
E. Change In Use: A nonconforming use of land or of a building or structure shall not be changed to any other use than a use permitted in the zoning
district. When such nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, the building or structure shall only be used thereafter for a use permitted
in the zoning district.
F. Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use of part or all of a building or structure, or nonconforming use of land, is discontinued or abandoned for a
period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, such use shall not be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use of such building, structure

restored unless such building or structure and the use thereof conform to all the regulations of the zoning district. When such damage or destruction is
fifty percent (50%) or less of replacement value of the building or structure immediately prior to such damage, the building or structure may be repaired
or reconstructed and used for the same nonconforming purpose, provided such repair of damage is completed within twelve (12) months of the date of
the damage or destruction. Any such repair shall be done in compliance with current building codes. (Ord. 4590, 9-21-1993)
Article V
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
14.501: PURPOSE:
The purpose of a planned unit development is to provide a tool to accommodate development which is in the public interest, provides a public benefit, and
which would not otherwise be permitted by the zoning ordinance. A planned unit development may be for residential, commercial, office or industrial use. A
mixed use development is also permitted, subject to the appropriate regulations of this article.
A planned unit development is of a substantially different character than other uses in this chapter and is, therefore, considered a conditional use. The
regulations applicable to planned unit developments in this article provide for a greater degree of flexibility than the strict regulation of individual zoning
districts.
A. Specifically, planned unit developments are intended to provide for:
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 310/724
1. A maximum choice in the types of development available by allowing developments that would not be possible under the strict application of the
regulations of other articles of this chapter.
2. Permanent preservation of common open space, recreation areas and public facilities.
3. Creative development designed to preserve topographic and geographic features.
4. An approach to the use of land that results in better development, design and amenities.
5. A use of land resulting in more efficient provision of utilities, streets, and other public facilities. (Ord. 4590, 9-21-1993; amd. Ord. 5751, 8-4-2009)
14.502: USE OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
A planned unit development is a conditional use which may be granted by the village board after a determination that the planned unit development is in
the best interest of the village and complies with the standards of this article. The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the village board
may require any reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote proper development. (Ord. 4590, 9-21-1993; amd. Ord. 5219, 11-6-2001)

For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required below. However,
where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date hereof, and provided that construction is begun within six (6) months of such
effective date and diligently executed to completion (completion to be accomplished within 18 months of the effective date hereof), parking and loading
facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this chapter.
When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises is increased through additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or
other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided
for such increase in intensity of use. (Ord. 6286, 12-6-2016)
14.2202: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Change Of Use: Whenever the existing use of a building or structure which has been provided with the required number of off street parking and
loading spaces of this chapter shall be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be required for the new use. If the building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of these parking standards, additional parking or loading facilities are required. Such additional parking shall be
calculated using the regulations of this chapter to determine the amount of parking the new use would exceed the parking requirements of the previous
use.
B. Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Off street parking or loading facilities which were in existence on the effective date hereof or were provided
voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced below the requirements of this chapter for a similar new building or use.
C. Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.

or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking or
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in the
event the principal building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value, it shall be
necessary to provide parking or loading facilities as required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or construction; provided, however, that if the
principal building or structure contains more than one use, parking and loading facilities, as required by this chapter, need be provided only for those
uses which have been damaged or destroyed to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of their replacement value.
E. Off Site Remote Parking Facilities: In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot in which the building or use served is
located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which parking facilities are accessory. Such
possession may either be by deed or long term lease, the term of such lease is subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission and filed
with the director of community development. The deed for the off site parking shall require such owner or heirs to maintain the required number of
parking spaces for the duration of the use served or the term of the lease, whichever shall terminate sooner. The village board shall have final authority
for these lease or deed approvals. Also, leases for off site parking should be limited to no more than one thousand feet (1,000') of the use served in the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 370/724
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any land or structure in the event that:

amendment thereof; and
B. Such approval has not by its own terms expired prior to such effective date; and
C. Such approval was issued on the basis of an application showing complete plans for proposed construction; and
D. There has been a substantial expenditure or incurrence of substantial obligations by the applicant in reliance on such approval; and

15.109: EXCEPTIONS:
Upon finding that severe hardship, caused by conditions uniquely attributable to the land under consideration, would be imposed upon an applicant by
compliance with these regulations and upon a finding that there are alternate feasible means of fulfilling the purpose and spirit of the regulations to protect
the public health, safety and welfare, the planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the president and board of trustees may grant exceptions
from the regulations of this chapter. However, no exception from the regulations of this chapter shall be granted or recommended for approval by the
planning and zoning commission unless findings of fact based on evidence are made in each specific case that affirm the following standards:
A. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a specific hardship to the owner
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations was to be applied;
B. The conditions upon which an application for an exception are based are unique to the property for which the exception is sought and are not generally
applicable to other property within the same zoning classification;
C. The purpose of the exception is not based primarily upon a desire to increase financial gain;
D. The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property;
E. The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which
the property is located;
F. The granting of the exception will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
G. The proposed exception will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion of the public
streets, or increase the danger of fire, or impair natural drainage or create drainage problems on adjacent properties, or endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
15.110: SEVERABILITY:
If any part or parts of this chapter shall be held to be unconstitutional, such unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this
chapter. The board of trustees hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this chapter if it had known that such part or parts thereof
would be declared unconstitutional. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)

under the specified test pressure. Allowable leakage shall not be greater than that computed as follows:
L =[SD(P)1/2]/132,200
L =allowable leakage in gallons per hour
S =length of pipeline tested in feet
D =nominal diameter of the pipe in inches
P =average test pressure during leakage test in pounds per square inch gauge
"Leakage" is defined as the quantity of water required to be supplied to the newly laid pipe necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure.
4. All pressure tests shall be done in the presence of the director of public works.
B. Preliminary Flushing: Prior to chlorination, the main shall be flushed as thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and outlets available. Flushing
shall be done after the pressure test is made. It must be understood that such flushing removes only the lighter solids and cannot be relied upon to
remove heavy material allowed to get into the main during installation. If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, a tap shall be provided large
enough to effect a velocity in the main of at least 2.5 feet per second.
C. Sterilization: All new water mains installed in the village shall be sterilized in conformance with the following procedures. All sterilization of water mains
shall be done by an experienced sterilization technician or specialist using these procedures, at which time and place the director of public works of the
village or an authorized representative of the village must be present. The technician or specialist conducting the sterilization shall submit to the village
a certificate of insurance prior to commencing his testing.
Sampling taps shall be provided on the water main every five hundred feet (500') in order to afford representative water testing and sample collection.
When long transmissional mains are constructed without side connections the distance between each tap may, at the discretion of the director of public
works of the village or his authorized representative, be increased. In all cases, a minimum of two (2) sampling taps shall be required. Sampling taps
shall be provided to collect a source sample and enough representative water samples for laboratory examination.
1. Sterilization Required: Before being placed in service all new mains and existing piping disturbed in any manner by the work shall be sterilized.
Draining the water from existing piping or even lowering the water pressure more than one-half (1/2) will constitute disturbance of the piping.
2. Sterilization Compound: The sterilization of water mains, valves and other appurtenances incorporated into the main construction shall be done by
chlorine gas water mixture. This shall be applied by means of a chlorinating measuring apparatus, with proper devices for regulating the flow and
providing an effective diffusion into the water within the main being sterilized.
Note: In certain instances when the use of chlorine gas is not practical, as in congested or confined areas, upon approval of the director of public
works of the village, or his authorized representative, a chlorine bearing compound of known chlorine content, prepared in solution form, may be
substituted for chlorine gas. The recommended chlorine bearing compounds shall be high test calcium hypochlorite (65_70 percent available
chlorine). In the preparation of this solution the powder shall first be made into a paste and then gradually thinned with water to approximately one
percent (1%) chlorine solution (10,000 parts per million).
3. Chlorine Application: The point of chlorine application shall be at the beginning of the water main construction and/or any valve section thereof,
through a corporation cock installed close to and on the downstream side of the regulating gate valve controlling the flow of water into the main. The
rate of chlorine application shall be in such proportion to the rate of water flow entering the main that the chlorine dose applied shall produce fifty (50)
parts per million (420 pounds per million gallons) chlorine concentration in the water within the main.
4. Use Of Mechanical Devices: During the sterilizing operations, valves, hydrants and other mechanical devices controlling the flow of water shall be
operated to permit full effectiveness of the chlorine. Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong solution within the main being sterilized will not
flow back into the supply line nor flow into mains already in service. A chlorine concentration test shall be made, in turn, at each of the hydrants
and/or taps provided for that purpose.
5. Retention Period: After the sterilizing operation has been completed and upon test proved satisfactory, the heavily chlorinated water shall be retained
in the main long enough to destroy all nonspore forming bacteria. This period shall be at least twenty four (24) hours. At the completion of the
retention period the chlorine concentration of the water within the main shall be at least twenty five (25) parts per million (210 pounds per million
gallons) of chlorine.
6. Newly Laid Pipe: In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the
chlorinating agent.

7. Standards For Disinfection: All water mains shall be disinfected and tested according to the requirements of the "Standards For Disinfecting Water
Mains", AWWA C-601, and as required by this chapter. All disinfection, as required by this chapter, shall be performed by an independent firm
exhibiting experience in the methods and techniques of this operation, and shall be done in the presence of the director of public works. The director
of public works shall be notified of the time of disinfection a minimum of twenty four (24) hours prior to the disinfection.
D. Final Flushing And Testing:
1. Final Flushing And Tests: After the required period of retention has elapsed, the heavily chlorinated water shall be flushed out completely to waste
until the replacement water throughout the length of the main shall, upon test, be proven comparable in quality to the water supply source.
2. Water Samples: When the water in the treated main shall have been proven comparable to that of the source, water samples shall be collected at
each of the sampling taps and submitted to the laboratory on two (2) separate days. Under no circumstances shall such samples be collected from
hydrants or unsterilized hose connections. All samples shall be taken in the presence of the director of public works of the village, or his authorized
representative, and upon completion of sampling all sample bottles shall be turned over to the village. The village shall transmit samples to the Cook
County health department for analysis and written report. The cost of mailing or other expenses incurred by the village in connection with sterilization
shall be paid by the permittee. Should the results of the bacteriological examination prove satisfactory, the main shall be placed in service. All turning
on and off of existing mains shall be done by or under the supervision of the director of public works of the village. Should the initial sterilization fail to
result in approval, the sterilization procedure shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained.
E. Fire Protection System Flushing:
1. All new underground piping that is to supply an automatic sprinkler system shall be flushed at a rate of ten feet (10') per second, or in accordance
with NFPA 13, "Standard For The Installation Of Sprinkler Systems". This flushing shall be witnessed by the fire prevention bureau.

3. Runoff coefficient for 100-year storms shall be a minimum of:
Impervious areas: C = 0.95
Pervious areas: C = 0.50
C. Outlet Design: Detention basin discharge structures shall be designed such that they have sufficient capacity to discharge the allowable release rate
from the development plus any storm water flowing through the property from all tributary area outside of the development. All outlet structures shall
conform to the following:
1. Site Discharge:
a. The restrictor and detention basin shall be designed to discharge no more than the maximum allowable release rate, regardless of the presence of
bypass flow.
b. The minimum allowable restrictor size shall be two inch (2") diameter.
c. The restrictor shall be designed to minimize the amount of maintenance needed.
2. Bypass Flow: Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system.
a. Upstream Areas Not Meeting Code Requirements: When areas exist upstream of the property that do not meet the storage and release rates of
this code, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant at the direction of the director of public works. The
following steps shall be followed:
(1) The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the applicant's property area, the release rates and the
procedures described herein.
(2) Areas tributary to the applicant's property not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this code shall be identified.
(3) Using the areas identified above plus the applicant's property area, allowable release rates, based on subsection B1 of this section shall be
computed.
(4) Using the areas identified above plus the applicant's property area, and the release rate determined in subsection C2a of this section, total
storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover
shall be assumed for the purposes of computing storage.
(5) Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the village may choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to
accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed in subsection C2a(1) of
this subsection. If regional storage is selected by the village, then the design produced in subsection C2a(3) of this section shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the village, the applicant has the option of bypassing all tributary area flows around the
applicant's basin. If the applicant chooses to route them through the basin, and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the
applicant must meet the provisions of on stream basins.
b. Upstream Areas Meeting Code Requirements: When areas exist upstream of the applicant's property that meet the requirements of this code, the
upstream flows shall either be bypassed around, or routed through the applicant's detention basin at the discretion of the village. Storage needed
for the applicant's property shall still be computed as described above. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an
applicant's basin, the final design storm water releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus the tributary area.
c. Discharge Requirements: In all cases where practicable, the design high water level shall be computed without considering bypass flow. The outlet
structure shall then be designed to discharge the bypass flow once the high water level is attained in the basin.
D. Basin Design:
1. Detention Basins: Detention basins, or "dry bottom ponds" shall be designed in accordance with the following:
a. Basin side slopes shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1) (horizontal:vertical).
b. The basin floor shall have a slope of not less than two percent (2%). In order to prevent soil erosion and weed problems and to provide for usable
active recreational areas during dry weather, the detention basin shall be landscaped including sodding and/or hydroseeding of the basin as
required.
c. Where practicable, the basin shall also have a low flow underdrain consisting of a minimum ten inch (10") storm sewer or perforated drain tile.
2. Retention Basins: Retention basins, or "wet bottom ponds" shall be designed in accordance with the following:
a. That portion of the side slope one foot (1') above the normal water level to three feet (3') below normal water level shall have a maximum slope of
four to one (4:1) (horizontal:vertical).
b. The area from one foot (1') above normal water level to two feet (2') below normal water level shall have a shoreline protection consisting of riprap
with a minimum twelve inch (12") diameter.
c. At the point three feet (3') below normal water a level ledge five feet (5') wide shall be constructed. From the edge of this five foot (5') ledge the
ground shall slope at two to one (2:1) (horizontal:vertical) for an additional three foot (3') depth. If fish life is to be sustained in the basin an area
equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the normal water surface area shall be a minimum of twelve feet (12') deep.
d. The ground above one foot (1') above the normal water elevation shall have a slope not steeper than ten (10) horizontal to one vertical for a
minimum horizontal distance of twenty feet (20'). Above this elevation, the slopes within the basin shall not be steeper than six (6) horizontal to one
vertical nor shallower than two percent (2%).
e. In those instances wherein the public health and safety dictates, a fence shall be placed around the periphery of the basin. The fence shall have a
minimum height of four feet (4') and be designed to be in keeping with the architectural characteristics of the building while providing security
around the detention pond.

Article VI
SPEED RESTRICTIONS
18.601: GENERAL SPEED RESTRICTIONS:
A. No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this Village at a speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic conditions
and the use of the highway, or endangers the safety of any person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable
maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazard exists with
respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding
with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.
B. No person may drive a vehicle upon any highway in this Village at a speed which is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit
established by subsection C of this Section, or by Section 18.605 of this Article.
C. Unless some other speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit in an urban district for all vehicles is:
1. Thirty (30) miles per hour.
2. Fifteen (15) miles per hour in any alley; and
3. The said urban speed limit may be increased as posted but not in excess of fifty five (55) miles per hour and may be diminished as posted but not
less than twenty (20) miles per hour, when such determination is passed and approved by ordinance, signposted and included in Schedule I of the
Appendix to this Chapter. (1981 Code)
18.602: PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE OF VIOLATION:
If any person shall drive a vehicle in excess of the speed limits established in this Article, such excessive speed shall be deemed prima facie evidence that
such person is driving at a speed greater than is reasonable, proper and safe, having regard to traffic conditions and the use of the street, or endangers
the safety of any person or property. (1981 Code)
18.603: MOTOR VEHICLES OF THE SECOND DIVISION:
No person shall drive any vehicle of the second division, which has a gross weight of fifteen thousand (15,000) pounds or more, at a speed greater than
twenty five (25) miles per hour in any district in this Village, notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of this Article. (1981 Code)
18.604: ELECTRONIC SPEED-DETECTING DEVICES:
Electronic speed-detecting devices shall not be used within five hundred feet (500') beyond any speed regulatory sign in the direction of travel (when such
sign indicates a reduction in the speed limit); if so used in violation hereof, evidence obtained thereby shall be inadmissible in any prosecution for
speeding. However, nothing in this Section prohibits the use of such electronic speed-detecting devices within five hundred feet (500') of a sign within a
special school speed zone indicating such zone, conforming to the requirements of Section 18.605 of this Article, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be
inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such special school
speed zone. (1981 Code; Ord. 3972, 8-16-1988)
18.605: SPECIAL SPEED LIMIT WHILE PASSING SCHOOLS:
A. No person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess of twenty (20) miles per hour while passing a school zone or while traveling upon any public
thoroughfare on or across which children pass along to and from school during school days when school children are present.
B. This Section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are posted upon streets and highways under the respective jurisdictions maintained by the
State of Illinois, township, county, park district or Village wherein the school zone is located. Such signs shall give proper due warning that a school
zone is being approached and shall indicate the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when school children are
present. Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-detecting devices within five hundred feet (500') of signs within a special
school speed zone indicating such zone, as defined in this Section, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for
speeding provided the use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such special school speed zone. (1981 Code)
18.606: MINIMUM SPEED REGULATION:
No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic except when reduced
speed is necessary for safe operation of his vehicle or in compliance with law. (1981 Code)
18.607: EMERGENCY VEHICLES:
The speed limits established by this Article or by regulation or ordinance made pursuant to the provisions of this Article do not apply, except as otherwise
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 440/724
provided in Article XIV as to ambulances, to an authorized emergency vehicle in motion when responding to an emergency call and when the driver
thereof sounds an audible signal by bell, siren or exhaust whistle, as may be reasonably necessary, provided that the vehicle is equipped and has in
operation at least one lighted lamp displaying an oscillating, rotating or flashing red beam visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of
five hundred feet (500') to the front of such vehicles. An authorized emergency fire department vehicle may be equipped and have in operation a triple
eight moving white beam light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of five hundred feet (500') to the front of such vehicle, in lieu of,
or in addition to a rotating or flashing red beam, in order to be exempt from the speed limits established by this Article or by regulation or ordinance made
pursuant to the provisions of this Article. No other authorized emergency vehicle shall use any oscillating triple eight moving white beam light other than
fire department vehicles. However, this provision does not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for
the safety of all persons using the street, nor does it protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequence of a reckless disregard of the safety of
others. (1981 Code)
18.608: SPECIAL SPEED LIMITATION ON ELEVATED STRUCTURES:
A. No person shall drive a vehicle over any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway at a speed which is greater than the
maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure, when such structure is signposted as provided by ordinance.
B. Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this Section, proof of the determination of the maximum speed by said ordinance and the
existence of such signs is conclusive evidence of the maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure. (1981 Code)
18.609: VIOLATIONS; CHARGES, EFFECT ON CIVIL ACTION:
A. In every charge of violation of a section of this Article by failure to observe an applicable speed limit, the complaint and also the summons or notice to
appear shall specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven, and the speed limit which is applicable at the place of the alleged
violation.
B. The provisions of this Article concerning maximum speed limits do not relieve the plaintiff in any civil action from the burden of proving negligence on
the part of the defendant as a proximate cause of the accident. (1981 Code)
Article VII

left of the center line of the roadway except when authorized by official traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left side of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use such lanes, or except as permitted under subsection A2 of this Section. However, this
subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway. (1981
Code)
18.702: PASSING VEHICLES PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS:
Drivers of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions, except as provided in Section 18.701 of this Article shall pass each other to the right and upon

No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless
authorized by the provisions of this Chapter and unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to
permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction or any vehicle overtaken. In every event the overtaking vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and in the event
the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within two hundred feet
(200') of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. (1981 Code)

hazard in the event another vehicle might approach from the opposite direction.
2. When approaching within one hundred feet (100') of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.
B. The limitations in subsections A1 and A2 of this Section do not apply upon a one-way roadway nor upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of
sufficient width for two (2) or more lanes of moving traffic in each direction nor to the driver of a vehicle turning left into or from an alley, private road or
driveway when such movements can be made with safety. (1981 Code)
18.707: NO PASSING ZONES:
A. The Department is authorized to determine those portions of any roadway under its jurisdiction where overtaking and passing or driving to the left of the
roadway would be especially hazardous and may be appropriate signs or markings on the roadway to indicate the beginning and end of such zone,
and when such signs or markings are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions
thereof.

It is unlawful for any person to operate any motor vehicle of the second division, except a truck tractor, to which this section is applicable upon the streets
or highways of this village unless such vehicle is equipped with rear fender splash guards of either the contour type or the flap type which comply with the
specifications provided in this section for the type of splash guards used on the vehicle, and which are so attached as to prevent the splashing of mud or
water upon the windshield of other motor vehicles.
A. Specifications For Contour Type Splash Guards: When contour type rear fender splash guards are used, they shall contour to the wheel in such a
manner that the relationship of the inside surface of any such splash guard to the tread surface of the tire or wheel shall be relatively parallel, both
laterally and across the wheel, at least throughout the top ninety degrees (90°) of the rear one hundred eighty degrees (180°) of the wheel surface;
provided however, on vehicles which have a clearance of less than five inches (5") between the top of the tire or wheel and that part of the body of the
vehicle directly above the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity, the curved portion of the splash guard need only extend
from a point directly behind the center of the rear axle and to the rear of the wheel surface upwards to within at least two inches (2") of the bottom line
of the body when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. There shall be a downward extension of the curved surface which shall end not
more than twelve inches (12") from the ground when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. This downward extension shall be part of the
curved surface or attached directly to such curved surface, but it need not contour the wheel. Such contour type splash guards shall be wide enough to
cover the full tread width of the tire or tires being protected and shall be installed not more than six inches (6") from the tread surface of the tire or
wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. The splash guard shall have a lip or flange on its outside edge to minimize side throw and
splash. The lip or flange shall extend toward the center of the wheel, and shall be perpendicular to and extend not less than two inches (2") below the
inside or bottom surface line or place of the guard. Such contour type splash guards may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material, but shall
be attached in such a manner that, regardless of movement either by the splash guards or the vehicle, the splash guards will retain their general
parallel relationship to the tread surface of the tire or wheel under all ordinary operating conditions.
B. Specifications For Flap Type Splash Guards: When flap type splash guards are used, they shall be wide enough to cover the full tread width of the tire
or tires being protected; shall be so installed that they extend from the underside of the vehicle in a vertical plane behind the rear wheels to within
twelve inches (12") of the ground, when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity; shall be so constructed and attached so that when the vehicle
is in forward motion such splash guard will not deviate or move backward from the vertical plane by an angle of more than thirty degrees (30°)
measured from the vertical plane and so that when the forward motion of the vehicle causes such splash guard to deviate from the vertical plane, the
bottom of such flap type splash guard will not be more than fifteen inches (15") from the ground, when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity.
Such flap type splash guard may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material.

prior to the sale, the police department or the towing service where the vehicle is impounded, shall cause a notice of the time and place of the sale to be
sent by certified mail to the registered owner or other person known by the police department or towing service to be legally entitled to the possession of
the vehicle. Such notice shall contain a complete description of the vehicle to be sold and what steps must be taken by any legally entitled person to
reclaim the vehicle.
In those instances where the certified notification specified in sections 18.1805 and 18.1806 of this article has been returned by the postal authorities to

without notice to the registered owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle.
B. When an abandoned vehicle of more than seven (7) years of age is impounded as specified by this article, it will be kept in custody for a minimum of ten
(10) days for the purpose of determining ownership, the contacting of the registered owner by the U.S. mail, public service or in person for a
determination of disposition; and, an examination of the state police stolen vehicles files for theft and wanted information. At the expiration of the ten
(10) day period, without the benefit of disposition information being received from the registered owner, the police department shall authorize the

3.1, 5/24-3.3 or 5/33A-2, 150/5.1, or in violation of 720 Illinois Compiled Statutes 550/4, 550/5, 550/5.1, 550/5.2 or 550/8 of the cannabis control act or in
violation of 720 Illinois Compiled Statutes 570/401, 570/401.1, 570/402 of the controlled substance act (or similar provision of local ordinance) shall be
subject to seizure and impoundment. The owner of record of such vehicle shall be liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount as set forth in
appendix A, division II of this code, in addition to fees for the towing and storage of the vehicle. Whenever a person is present within any motor vehicle of
which the person is the owner, lessee, permittee, bailee, legal possessor or occupier at the time a violation occurs, it shall be prima facie evidence that a
person had knowledge of the violation.
A. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer
shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the village or its agents. When the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify the
person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the
vehicle owner's right to request a preliminary hearing to be conducted under this section.
B. Whenever the owner of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section requests a preliminary hearing within twelve (12) hours after the seizure, a hearing
officer as appointed by the chief of police shall conduct such preliminary hearing within forty eight (48) hours after the seizure. All interested persons
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay
evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle, operated with
the knowledge of the owner, was used in the commission of any crime set forth in this section, the hearing officer shall order the continued

impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount as set forth in
appendix A, divisions I and II of this code, plus fees for towing the vehicle. If the hearing officer determines that there is no such probable cause, the
vehicle will be returned without penalty or other fees.
C. Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested,
the owner and/or lessee of record of the date, time and location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this section. The hearing shall be
conducted no later than forty five (45) days after the vehicle was seized. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at
the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle, operated with the knowledge of
the owner, was used in the commission of any of the violations set forth in this section, the hearing officer shall enter an order requiring the vehicle to
continue to be impounded until the owner pays an administrative fee in the amount as set forth in appendix A, division II of this code, plus fees for
towing and storage of the vehicle. The fees shall be a debt due and owing the village. However, if a cash bond has been posted the bond shall be
applied to the fees. If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not knowingly used in such violation, he or she shall order the return of the
vehicle or cash bond.
D. Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial review
of the village's action under this section, or the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, may be disposed of as an unclaimed
vehicle as provided by law. As used in this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle means the record titleholder.
E. Fees for towing and storage of a vehicle under this section shall be the same as those established by administration of the village.
F. This section shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing state or federal laws or local ordinances pertaining to vehicle seizure and impoundment
including, but not limited to, those set forth in section 13.504 of this code. (Ord. 4753, 9-5-1995; amd. Ord. 5189, 5-15-2001; Ord. 5732, 4-8-2009)

B. Notwithstanding the penalties provided in subsection A of this section for a person convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter, any police
officer may, in lieu of the filing of the complaint in court in the first instance, issue to such alleged violator a citation with respect to the violation of the

C. Such citation shall be on a standard form for use in the circuit court of Cook County or shall be in form of a notice suitable for mailing, and shall state
the specific section of this chapter that was violated and shall inform the alleged violator that he may settle the said violation claim and avoid an
appearance in court for such a violation in the following manner:
1. The alleged violator may settle such violation claim by payment at a designated department of the village the sum as set forth in appendix A, division
III of this code, within ten (10) days following the issuance of said citation, or by depositing the preaddressed citation with payment enclosed and with
appropriate postage affixed, in the U.S. mail.
2. In the event that the said violator to whom the citation is issued fails to settle the violation claim within the first period of ten (10) days and said
violator is issued a notice of nonpayment, then the alleged violator may settle such violation claim by payment at a designated department of the
village the sum as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, within ten (10) days following the issuance of the notice of nonpayment, or by
depositing the preaddressed citation, with payment enclosed and with appropriate postage affixed, in the U.S. mail during said period.
3. In the event that the said violator to whom the citation is issued fails to settle the violation claim within the original period of ten (10) days and the
additional period of ten (10) days following the notice of nonpayment and violator is issued a final notice, then the alleged violator may settle such
violation claim by payment at a designated department of the village the sum as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, within ten (10) days
following the issuance of the final notice, or by depositing the preaddressed citation, with payment enclosed and with appropriate postage affixed, in
the U.S. mail during said period.
4. In the event that no settlement payment is made within the ten (10) day period prescribed in the final notice, then the issuing police officer shall
cause a "notice to appear" to be served upon the alleged violator or shall file a complaint with respect to said violation and the same shall be
processed in the circuit court of Cook County in accordance with the penalty provided in subsection A of this section.
5. When the alleged violation involves a failure to comply with vehicle identification or equipment requirements of this chapter, then in addition to a
payment of the amount set forth above, the alleged violator must also show proof of compliance with the section so violated in order to achieve a
settlement of the violation claim.
The fact that an automobile or motor vehicle which is illegally operated or parked is registered with the secretary of state in the name of said alleged
violator; or, in the alternative, in the event that a vehicle sticker issued by the village has been issued in the name of and to said alleged violator, shall
be considered as prima facie proof that said alleged violator was in control of or was the operator of the automobile or motor vehicle at the time of such
alleged violation.
All payments made in settlement of a violation claim pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be duly receipted for by the finance department
official receiving the same, and such payments shall be promptly remitted to the village treasurer to be credited to the proper fund of the village. (Ord.

18.1907: VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION AND IMPOUNDMENT FOR VIOLATIONS:
A. The chief of police, or his designee, is hereby authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization as provided in this article. This
program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon a public way or public property by placement of a restraint in
such a manner as to prevent its operation. If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of this code concerning obstruction of
traffic, access or egress from driveways, alleys, fire lanes, hydrants or stations, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or a hazard, or where
it impedes village workers during such operations as snow removal, the chief of police, or his designee, may cause the eligible vehicle to be towed to
the designated village impoundment facility or relocated to a legal parking place and there restrained.
B. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization as provided herein any time after inclusion of its state registration number, or previous or succeeding state
registration number, on any immobilization list. A vehicle shall be placed on an immobilization list only if:
1. The registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated three (3) or more parking, compliance or village vehicle license violation complaints in any
eighteen (18) month period within the village in which no payment has been made or appearance filed in the circuit court of Cook County within the
time specified by the complaints;
2. At least twenty one (21) days prior to placing the registration plate number of the vehicle on the immobilization eligibility list, notice of impending
vehicle immobilization has been sent to the registered owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first-class mail, postage prepaid, at the
address of the registered owner recorded with the secretary of state or, in the case of vehicle bearing a registration number of a state other than
Illinois, at the address of the registered owner recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 483/724
C. The notice required in subsection B2 of this section shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the
vehicle, the nature of the codes violated and the numbers and issue dates of the outstanding complaints. The notice shall also advise that a person
may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by requesting, in writing, a preimmobilization hearing.
The registered owner of the vehicle whose vehicle's registration number has been placed on the immobilization list shall have the right to a
preimmobilization hearing to determine whether the vehicle was properly included on an immobilization list, provided the owner has filed a written
demand for a hearing with the chief of police. A preimmobilization hearing shall be conducted by the chief of police or his designee within five (5)
business days of the receipt of a written demand for hearing unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. A preimmobilization hearing provided by
this section shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of violation issued relative to the eligible vehicle.
The registered owner shall appear in person and submit evidence which would conclusively disprove liability, such as the following:
1. That the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of violation were issued; or
2. That the fines or penalties for the violations cited in the report were paid; or
3. That there have not been issued to the registered owner three (3) or more parking, compliance or village vehicle violation complaints.
D. Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle is
immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in damage.
The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of both state and local law. The notice
also shall provide information specifying how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may obtain a
postimmobilization hearing pursuant to this section.
E. Except where the vehicle is otherwise subject to towing, if the immobilizing restraint has not been released pursuant to this section within twenty four
(24) hours of its placement, the restraint may be released and the vehicle towed and impounded.
F. Prior to a postimmobilization hearing on the validity of the immobilization as provided herein, the owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized
person shall be permitted to secure release of the vehicle by:
1. Paying the immobilization and towing and storage fees, if applicable, specified herein; and
2. Taking one of the following actions:
a. Paying all of the fines and penalties, if any, on the outstanding complaints specified in the notice of impending vehicle immobilization; or
b. Completing the circuit court appearance forms on all outstanding violation complaints specified in the notice of impending vehicle immobilization
and depositing collateral in the amount of fifty percent (50%) of the total fines for the outstanding violation complaints specified in the notice of
impending vehicle immobilization, or in the amount as set forth in appendix A, divisions II and III of this code, whichever is less. Collateral shall be
in the form of U.S. currency, traveler's checks, money order, or certified check, but no personal checks shall be acceptable.
G. Within ten (10) days after a vehicle has been impounded, notice of impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
registered owner of the vehicle at the address to which the notice specified in subsection B2 of this section was mailed. The notice shall state that the
owner has the right to a postimmobilization hearing as provided herein, and that if the car is not claimed within thirty (30) days from the date of the
notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with this section.
The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a postimmobilization hearing if the owner files a written demand for a hearing with the chief
of police within fourteen (14) days after issuance of the notice specified herein or within fourteen (14) days of the immobilization, whichever is later. A
postimmobilization hearing shall be conducted by the chief of police or his designee within five (5) business days of the receipt of a written demand for
hearing unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Failure to request or attend a scheduled postimmobilization hearing shall be deemed a waiver
of the right to a hearing. In the event of such failure to attend a scheduled hearing, any amount deposited pursuant to subsection F of this section shall
be forfeited to the village. A postimmobilization hearing provided by this section shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or
notice of violation issued relative to the immobilized vehicle. The sole purpose of a postimmobilization hearing will be to determine whether the vehicle
was properly placed on an immobilization list.
To prevail at a postimmobilization hearing, the registered owner shall appear in person and submit evidence which would conclusively disprove liability,
such as the following:
1. That the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of violation were issued; or
2. That the fine or penalties for the violations cited in the report were paid; or
3. That there have not been issued to the registered owner three (3) or more parking, compliance or village vehicle violation complaints.
H. The fee for immobilization shall be as set forth in appendix A, division II of this code. The fee for towing as well as any storage fee shall be the fee as
designated in the then current village towing contract, provided that no fees shall be assessed for any immobilization or tow which has been
determined to be erroneous.
I. It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilizing device without the approval of the chief of police or his designee. The
unauthorized removal of an immobilized vehicle shall be subject to a penalty as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code. (Ord. 3423, 6-5-1984;
amd. Ord. 4892, 10-7-1997; Ord. 5189, 5-15-2001; Ord. 5518, 11-1-2005)

C. Warrants For Stop Signs:
1. Design:
a. The sign shall be octagon with white message and border on a red background. The standard size shall be thirty inches by thirty inches
(30" x 30"). Where greater emphasis on visibility is required, a larger size may be used. On low volume local and secondary streets with low
approach speeds, a twenty four inch by twenty four inch (24" x 24") size may be used.
b. At a multi-way stop intersection a supplementary plate should be mounted just below each stop sign. If the number of approach legs to the
intersection is three (3) or more, the numeral on the supplementary plate shall correspond to the actual legs, or the legend "All Way" may be used.
The supplementary plate shall have white letters on a red background and shall have a standard size of twelve inches by six inches (12" x 6") or
eighteen inches by six inches (18" x 6"). Where accident frequency at an intersection does not meet the warrants for a four-way stop sign but is
considered a hazard, a supplementary plate may be added with the legend "Thru Traffic".
c. A stop sign beacon or beacons may be used in conjunction with a stop sign.
d. Secondary messages shall not be used on stop sign faces.
2. Warrants:
a. Preamble: Because the stop sign causes a substantial inconvenience to motorists, it should be used only when warranted. A stop sign may be
warranted at an intersection where one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1) Intersection of a minor street with another minor street where application of the normal right-of-way rule is unduly hazardous.
(2) Intersection of a local street with a collector street or an arterial street.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 517/724
(3) Intersection of two (2) collector or arterial streets where no traffic signal is present.
(4) Unsignalized intersection in a signalized area.
(5) Other intersections where a condition of high speed, restricted view, serious accident record or daily public assemblage indicates a need for
control by a stop sign.
Note: Where two (2) main highways intersect, the stop sign or signs should normally be posted on the minor street to stop the lesser flow of
traffic. Traffic engineering studies, however, may justify the installation of a stop sign or signs on the major street, as at a three-way intersection
where safety considerations may justify stopping the greater flow of traffic to permit a left-turning movement.
b. The "Multiway Stop" installation has been found useful as a safety measure at some locations. It should ordinarily be used where the volume of
traffic on the intersecting streets is approximately equal. Any of the following conditions may warrant a multiway stop sign installation.
(1) Where traffic signals are soon to be installed to reduce cross traffic hazard (warranted and urgently needed), the multiway stop is an interim
measure that can be installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the signal installation.
(2) An accident problem, as indicated by five (5) or more reported accidents of a type susceptible of correction by a multiway stop sign installation
in a twelve (12) month period. Such accidents include right and left-turn collisions as well as right-angle collisions.
3. Other Usage And Nonusage:
a. Stop signs also may be erected facing traffic entering a street or highway from cemeteries, parks, parking lots and private roads.
b. No definite rule can be established to govern the placement of stop signs at wye junctions because of the variation of the direction of principal
traffic movement.
(1) Each wye junction shall be given individual study.
(2) As a general guide, if the volume of traffic in the conflicting movements as either intersecting point of a wye junction is light and has a ratio of
less than six (6) to one, it is sufficient justification for stopping the larger traffic movement in favor of the smaller.
c. No stop signs shall be erected at intersections where traffic control signals are present except as a temporary measure during signal maintenance
of relatively short duration.
d. Portable stop signs shall never be used for school crossings or other part-time usages. The efficiency of any stop sign as pedestrian protection is
debatable, and the reliance on traffic obedience of intermittent stop control without a flashing-red indication as an attention attracting device is
insufficient protection for school children.
D. Warrants For Yield:
1. The yield sign shall not be regarded as a substitute for a stop sign where a stop sign is warranted. Yield signs shall not be used:
a. Where visibility limitations or prevailing high speeds or volumes of traffic make a full stop necessary for safety.
b. Against the major flow of traffic at an intersection.
c. On the approaches of more than one of the intersecting streets or highways.
d. Where there are stop signs on one or more approaches of an intersection, except under unusual circumstances at complex intersections.
e. On through roadways.
2. The yield sign is warranted:
a. On a minor street at the entrance to an intersection where it is necessary to assign right-of-way to the major street, but where a stop is not
necessary at all times, and where the safe approach speed on the minor road exceeds ten (10) miles per hour.
b. Within an intersection with a divided highway, or at median openings facing traffic entering the second roadway of the divided highway where the
median width exceeds thirty feet (30').
c. Where there is a separate or channelized right turn lane, without an adequate acceleration lane.
d. At any intersection where a special problem exists and where an engineering study indicates the problem to be susceptible to correction by use of
the yield sign.
3. The yield sign shall be placed as near the intersecting roadway as possible but not more than fifty feet (50') away. Should the visibility to the sign be
restricted, a "Yield Ahead" sign may be erected in advance.
E. Location Of Stop Sign And Yield Sign: The location and proper erection of the control devices shall be in accordance with the applicable portions of the
U.S., DOT, FHWA, "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices" and the State of Illinois DOT "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices". (1981

The purpose of this article is to maintain this village's eligibility in the national flood insurance program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding
including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare, and to preserve and
enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources. This
article is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
A. To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18G, an act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the state of
Illinois, approved June 10, 1911, as amended;
B. To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
C. To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage;
D. To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
E. To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood resource and relief
operations;
F. To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program;
G. To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
H. To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources;
I. To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats;
J. To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
22.102: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this article, the following definitions are adopted:
ACT: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the state of Illinois, 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the regulatory floodway that are permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be
allowed are as specified in subsection 22.107B of this article.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-
year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section 22.105 of this article.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally aboveground enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home,
mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days, unless they are fully licensed and ready for highway use.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine,
wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping or other armoring, widening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody vegetation.
Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form of
channel modification typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g., straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural
flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A REGULATORY FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction approval by IDNR/OWR and the federal emergency
management agency of a proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to this article, gives assurances to the property
owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review
and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that the federal emergency management agency will revise base flood
elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map,

market value of the structure either: a) before the improvement or repair is started, or b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. This term includes structures which were damaged whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value before the damage occurred, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of
this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: a) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe
living conditions; or b) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure". (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5620, 4-3-2007; Ord. 5702, 7-15-2008)
22.103: HOW TO USE THIS ARTICLE:
The director of community development shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 22.104 of this article.
To fulfill those duties, the director of community development first should use the criteria listed in section 22.105, "Base Flood Elevation", of this article, to
determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the director of
community development must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain on
which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the director of community development shall require that the minimum

review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any article changes. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)
22.105: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This article's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not
available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey's floodplain
information repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing
data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA.
A. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Des Plaines River, Feehanville Ditch, McDonald Creek, McDonald Creek
Tributary B and Weller Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and
dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
B. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time.
C. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the
village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository. When no base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a
backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a
hydrologic model such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States geological survey for
estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted
local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR
for approval; once approved they must be submitted to the Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA,
the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus one foot (1'), unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the
Illinois state water survey. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5620, 4-3-2007; Ord. 5702, 7-15-2008)

B. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.
1. Elevation Of Site: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
2. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill
or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume
of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and onehalf
(1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made
opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002)

The director of community development shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A
registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section.
B. Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which
will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be
a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently
impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article.
Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois administrative code 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement
of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate
uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined
above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
Public flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding of existing
structures, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as instream aeration and similar treatment facilities,
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, and commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
Underground and overhead utilities;
Public open space and recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when
viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions;
Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and railways necessary for crossing over the floodway or for providing access to other
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 591/724
appropriate uses in the floodway and any modification thereto;
Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or
construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than
ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and which does not increase the outside dimensions of the building.
1. Appropriate Use Construction Criteria: Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the
construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure
meets the protection requirements of section 22.109 of this article.
a. Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration:
(1) Regulatory floodway conveyance,
"K" = (1.486/n)AR2/3
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
(See "Open Channel Hydraulics", Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York);
(2) The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a
federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative
to a nonvegetative land cover;
(3) Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that
more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(A) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
(B) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length;
(C) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used;
(D) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory
floodway delineation on adjacent properties;
(E) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
b. Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not to Increase Downstream Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially
created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway
storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage
lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost
above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed
to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the
applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway
modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
c. Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage, for all
flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the
purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
d. Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1') when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the
channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed
construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1'), the developer must contact IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for
a dam safety permit or waiver.
(1) The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 22.105 of this article. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA hydraulic
chart for selection of highway culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/federal highway administration hydraulics of bridge
waterways calculation procedures.
(2) Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection B1b of this section.
(3) Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B1c of this section.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 592/724
(4) If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a department of transportation permit
must be received.
(5) The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this subsection B.
(6) All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection B1h of this section.
e. Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And Approach Roads:
(1) The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth foot (0.1')
increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not
a source of flood damage.
(2) If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
(3) The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with the department of transportation rules 92 Illinois administrative code 708 (floodway construction in northeastern Illinois) and
submitted to the office for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
f. On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot (0.0') when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for a
dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and
impoundment structures as defined in section 22.102 of this article, shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois administrative code 702
(construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
(1) The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional storm water detention;
(2) The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning;
(3) The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
(4) A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize
the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed
control;
(5) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
g. Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.
h. Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR
through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length
shall be used.
(4) Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections.
i. Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
(1) There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of
water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is
acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
(2) Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be
destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;
(3) The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions
of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
(A) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated
into channel modification design, where practical.
(B) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 593/724
prevent erosion.
(C) One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side
of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.
(D) Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.
(E) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than four to one (4:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(F) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the
vegetative cover.
(G) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
(H) A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
(I) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion
of water into the new channel.
(J) There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated
by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of habitat improvement or erosion control project.
(K) Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification; and
(4) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
j. Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
k. Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for
erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
(1) The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time
soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the initiation of improvements.
(2) Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may
not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
(3) Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of
eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment basins.
(4) A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels (see subsection B1p of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
(5) Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "Standards And Specifications For Soil Erosion
And Sediment Control" (IEPA, 1987).
l. Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant
can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in
increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
m. General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
(1) The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 22.105 of this article, must be used for
analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval
and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
(2) If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year
frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
(3) If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be
removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next
five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions
and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.
n. Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency
flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a
permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by IDNR/OWR until as built plans or record drawings are
submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 594/724
in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No
filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until
a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
o. Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
p. Construction Near Channel: For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria
shall be met:
(1) A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
(2) Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established
upon completion of construction.
(3) The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for
stream maintenance purposes.
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is
not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received.
The regulatory floodway map will be revised on acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as built plans.
2. State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review
and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
a. IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection B1d of this section.
b. IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection B1e of this section.
c. The IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections B1a, B1b and B1h of this
section.
d. The IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams (as defined in section 22.102 of this
article) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or county.
3. Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/5 et seq. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the office has delegated this responsibility to the village.
4. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a "dam" as defined in section 22.102 of this article per 92 Illinois
administrative code 702 (rules for construction of dams) shall obtain an Illinois office of water resources dam safety permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam. If the director of community development finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the director of community
development shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the office of water resources. If the director of community development finds a dam
which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the director of community development shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, dam
safety section in Springfield and the Illinois emergency management agency (IEMA).
5. Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's Review: The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements.
a. Underground and overhead utilities that:
(1) Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or
(2) Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or
(3) In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing
streambed; and
(4) In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris.
b. Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
(1) Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; and
(2) Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
(3) Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location.
c. Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.
d. Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that:
(1) Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length;
(2) Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank;
(3) Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake;
(4) Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions should be avoided unless there are not practicable alternatives.

2011)
22.108: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHAs WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED:
In SFHAs or floodplains (including AO zones, AH zones or unnumbered A zones), where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the
cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the
flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
A. Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in an SFHA or
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from director of community development. Application for a development permit shall be made on
a form provided by the director of community development. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing
property line dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer,
architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement)
of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 22.109 of this article.
1. The application for a development permit shall also include the following information:
a. A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and intended use;
b. Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be
in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
c. Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity;
d. Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum:
(1) A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or
numerical scale, and north arrow;
(2) A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the structure
or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum of NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body
of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale;
(3) Cross sectional views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of
the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year
frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and
(4) A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and
the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of
final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance;
e. Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection B of this
section;
f. Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development.
2. Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois state water survey's floodplain information repository, the director of community
development shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for
the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection 22.105C of this article. Any development located on land that
can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
3. The director of community development shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits,
approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The director of community development shall not issue the
development permit unless all required local, state, and federal permits have been obtained.
B. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods
as called for in this article.
1. Standards And Permits: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply:

year flood elevation. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (Ord. 5253, 5-21-2002; amd. Ord. 5877,
9-20-2011)
22.109: PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS:
In addition to the requirements found in sections 22.106, 22.107 and 22.108 of this article, for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways, and
SFHAs or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (zone A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E) the following requirements
shall be met:
A. Public Health Standards:
1. No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE.

manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
B. Carrying Capacity And Notification: For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying
capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance
of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
C. Protecting Buildings: All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain also known as an SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood
protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards
included in section 22.107 of this article. This building protection criteria applies to the following situation:
Construction or placement of a new building;
Nonconforming structures may remain in use, but shall not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood,
fire, wind or other manmade or natural disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty percent (50%), considered on a cumulative basis, of
its market value. In which case, it must, thereafter, conform to this article;
Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply to
returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and
Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods:
1. A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following:
a. The lowest floor, (including basement) shall be a minimum of two feet (2') above the base flood elevation;

b. The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1') deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation.
However, the ten foot (10') minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties. The design of the fill or fill standard must be approved by a registered engineer.
2. A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with the following:
a. The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently open to floodwaters and
not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one
foot (1') above grade, and consist of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation;
b. The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize
exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris;
c. All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement)
and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located a minimum of two feet (2') above
the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the flood protection elevation;
d. The areas below the flood protection elevation may only be used for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement.
When the building wall encloses open space that is below the base flood elevation, gravity storm and sanitary sewer connections are specifically
prohibited and overhead sewers are required for the sanitary connections and sumps for the storm sewer connections;
e. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the rules and
regulations for the Illinois mobile home tie down act issued pursuant to 77 Illinois administrative code. In addition, all manufactured homes shall
meet the following elevation requirements:
(1) In case of manufactured homes placed or substantially improved: a) outside of manufactured home park or subdivision, b) in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision, c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or d) in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage from a flood, the top of the lowest floor
shall be elevated to or above the flood protection elevation;
(2) In the case of manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, the manufactured
home shall be elevated so that either the top of the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation or the chassis is at least thirty six inches (36")
in height above grade and supported by reinforced piers or other foundations of equivalent strength, whichever is less;
f. Recreational vehicles or travel trailers shall be required to meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of subsection C2e of this section unless:
(1) They are on site for less than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; and
(2) They are fully licensed and ready for highway use.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utility
and service devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
3. Only a nonresidential building may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify
that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight
and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be
operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees, beams, floodwalls and similar works are not considered

insurance coverage;
2. Increase the risks to life and property; and
3. Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.

22.112: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does
not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This article does not create liability on the part of

An abatement action under this section is a remedy cumulative to other remedies at law and equity. Injunctive relief may be sought to prevent or restrain

criminal prosecution or any other remedy. Failure to adhere to the procedure prescribed in this section shall not bar relief or remedy if such failure causes
no prejudice and merely constitutes harmless error.
The following shall be the procedure for the abatement of a nuisance within the jurisdiction of the village:
A. Notice shall be given to the owner of the nuisance or the owner of the property on which the nuisance exists. For purposes of this section, the person to
whom the last general tax bill on the property was sent shall be presumed to be the owner. Notice by regular mail and posting of notice on the front
entrance to the structure or similar location shall be deemed sufficient, legal notice to the owner and all other responsible parties. If there is no structure
on the property, a sign may be posted anywhere on the premises.
B. The notice shall state the location and nature of the nuisance. It shall inform the owner that if the nuisance is not abated within a specified number of
days, the village will, at the expense of such owner, have such nuisance abated. Fourteen (14) days shall be such specified number unless otherwise
stated in this code, or the public health and safety require a shorter abatement period. The obligations of the owner are continuing obligations which
are effective for one year from the date of the notice, which date shall be the date the notice was mailed or the date the notice was posted, whichever
comes last.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 630/724
C. If upon the giving of notice, the owner fails to abate the nuisance within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, the village may cause the
nuisance to be abated, as it deems appropriate. The cost of the abatement shall be assessed against the land upon which the nuisance is located.
D. If the nuisance is of such threat to the welfare and safety of the community that it must be abated immediately, the village manager, in his or her sole
discretion, is authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to effect the abatement regardless of the requirements of this article.
E. All fees, costs or charges assessed or incurred by the village shall be a lien upon the real property. The lien shall be superior to all subsequent liens and
encumbrances. The director shall file a notice of lien within two (2) years after such cost and expense is incurred, which notice of lien shall be filed in
the office of the Cook County recorder of deeds.
1. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner or responsible party after notice of lien has been filed, the village shall release the lien.
2. The lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgages or mechanic's liens. (Ord. 5536, 1-17-2006)
23.1405: ORIGINATING OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE JURISDICTION:
Upon a reasonable showing that a nuisance from a source outside the village jurisdiction is causing prejudice to a resident or residents of the village, the
village manager shall have the authority to pursue all avenues, including the institution of court proceedings to effect the abatement of such nuisance.
(Ord. 5536, 1-17-2006)
23.1406: FEE:
Any person found maintaining a nuisance as set forth in this article and who fails to abate it within thirty (30) days or such shorter time period contained in
any order to abate, shall be absolutely liable to the village for a daily nuisance fee in the amount set forth in appendix A, division II of this code. This
nuisance fee shall be in addition to any fines or costs recoverable pursuant to this article or any other code provision. (Ord. 5536, 1-17-2006)

23.1804: RENTAL AGREEMENTS:
A. Terms And Conditions:
1. The landlord and tenant may include in a rental agreement terms and conditions not prohibited by this article and other rules of law, including rent,
term of the agreement and other provisions governing the rights and obligations of the parties.
2. The landlord and tenant shall include in a rental agreement terms and conditions required by this article.
3. All rental agreements between landlords and tenants, including renewal rental agreements to the extent not otherwise excepted in subsection B of
this section, must be in writing, dated and signed by both parties with signed copies provided to both at the time of signing.
4. Rent is to be payable without demand or notice at the time and place agreed upon by the parties. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the
landlord's place of business at the beginning of any term of one month or less and otherwise in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each
month. Unless otherwise agreed, rent shall be uniformly apportionable from day to day.
5. Unless the rental agreement fixes a definite term, the tenancy shall be week to week in the case of a tenant who pays weekly rent, and in all other
cases month to month.
6. The lease shall inform the tenant that the interior of the unit may be subject to regular inspection and/or investigation of complaints of violations for
compliance with village codes to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents and the public.
B. Effect Of Unsigned Or Undelivered Agreement:
1. If the landlord does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement to the tenant which has been signed and delivered by the tenant to the landlord,
acceptance of rent without reservation by the landlord gives the rental agreement the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 647/724
landlord, for the term set forth in the rental agreement.
2. If the tenant does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement to the landlord which has been signed and delivered by the landlord to the tenant,
acceptance of possession and payment of rent without reservation gives the rental agreement the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered
by the tenant.
3. For delivery of notice, as required in subsections B1 and B2 of this section, to become effective, delivery must be sent certified mail, receipt
requested, or made by personal service, in which case the landlord or tenant, as the case may be, delivering the written rental agreement must
request the person receiving the agreement, which may include the respective landlord, landlord's agent, lessee, or member of the household over
the age of twelve (12), to acknowledge receipt in writing on a duplicate copy of the agreement. Evidence that the rental agreement was sent certified
mail and signed for or returned without being accepted or that receipt of the rental agreement was otherwise acknowledged in writing, as set forth
herein, shall create a rebuttable presumption of delivery.
C. Prohibited Provisions:
1. Except as otherwise provided by this article, no rental agreement may provide that the tenant or the landlord:
a. Agrees to waive or to forego rights or remedies under this article;
b. Authorizes any person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the rental agreement;
c. Agrees to the limitation of any liability of the landlord or tenant arising under law or to indemnify the landlord or tenant for that liability or the costs
connected therewith. Provided, however, that nothing contained herein precludes indemnification of the other party by the party found to be at fault
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
2. A provision prohibited by subsection C1 of this section included in a rental agreement is unenforceable. If a landlord deliberately attempts to enforce
any provision in a rental agreement which is prohibited, the tenant may recover an amount totalling not more than two (2) months' rent and such
damages, costs and fees as a court shall determine and award.
3. If a court finds the rental agreement, or a settlement in which a party waives or agrees to forego a claim or right under this article or under the rental
agreement, to have been unconscionable when made, the court may grant the following relief:
a. Nonenforcement;
b. Nonenforcement of the unconscionable provision only; or
c. Limit the application of any provision to avoid an unconscionable result;
d. Such other relief as the court deems proper.
D. Notice Of Nonrenewal Of Rental Agreement:
1. If the rental agreement will not be renewed, the landlord shall notify the tenant in writing not less than sixty (60) days prior to the termination date, or
if a month to month tenancy will be terminated, the landlord shall notify the tenant in writing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the termination date.
In no event shall the tenant remain on the premises more than thirty (30) days after such notice or the end of the lease term, whichever occurs last.
2. If the landlord fails to give the required written notice, the tenant may remain in his rental unit on a month to month basis under the same other terms
and conditions as the prior term, until such time as the required thirty (30) days' notice is given and becomes operative as set forth in subsection D1
of this section. The tenant shall be obligated to pay rent in a timely fashion. Notwithstanding this provision, a written renewal rental agreement is
required at the end of the lease term unless the thirty (30) days' notice has been given.
E. Attachment Of Article To Rental Agreement: Following the effective date of this article, a copy thereof, or excerpts thereof in a form provided to the
landlord by the Village, shall be attached to each rental agreement, along with a copy of the Village's occupancy requirements from the Village's
property maintenance code, delivered by or on behalf of a landlord when any such agreement is presented for signing to any tenant. (Ord. 3366, 9-6-
1983; amd. Ord. 4728, 5-16-1995; Ord. 4868, 6-17-1997; Ord. 5536, 1-17-2006; Ord. 5619, 3-6-2007; Ord. 5807, 8-3-2010)

A. Comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants by provisions of the codes applicable to the rental unit;
B. Keep that part of the premises that the tenant occupies and uses as safe as the condition of the premises permits;

J. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the landlord, not apply any part of a security deposit as part of obligated rent payments;
K. Comply with representations made in the rental application. Any material misrepresentation made in the application shall be cause for termination of the
rental agreement;

seal unbroken. For the purpose of this subsection, a public place shall include, but not be limited to, all village streets and all parking areas and
common areas serving multi-family residential structures containing four (4) or more dwelling units, provided that this prohibition shall apply to such
multi-family common areas only if the owner, manager, or owners' association has stated, in writing, that it is the intention of the ownership of such
owner of common area that the prohibition be applied. The written statement may reserve the right of management to give one day permits for
residents or tenants to hold social gatherings in a common area;
M. Sublet only in accordance with the terms of the lease. Under no circumstances shall the tenant sublet the unit or rent any portion of the unit for any
consideration whatsoever so long as the tenant uses the unit as the tenant's own residence, domicile or sleeping quarters for more than one day in any
thirty (30) day period. (Ord. 3366, 9-6-1983; amd. Ord. 4424, 4-21-1992; Ord. 4728, 5-16-1995; Ord. 4868, 6-17-1997)
23.1806: LANDLORD OBLIGATIONS:
A. Security Deposits Or Prepaid Rent:
1. A landlord who receives a security deposit or prepaid rent from a tenant must comply in full with the provisions of the Illinois state law which provides
that landlords must pay interest on security deposits in developments with twenty five (25) or more rental units, and within thirty (30) days after the
end of each twelve (12) month rental period, pay to the tenant any such interest by cash or credit to be applied to rent due, except when the tenant is
in default under the terms of the rental agreement.
2. Upon termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the landlord as security or prepaid rent may be applied to the payment of accrued rent
and to the payment of actual damages, which the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with section 23.1805 of this article,
provided the landlord, within thirty (30) days of the date that the tenant has vacated the rental unit, delivers upon tenant a written notice, which shall
include the reason for retaining the security deposit or portion thereof, including an itemized statement for any claim of unpaid rent and an itemized
statement of any damages, together with copies of the actual paid damage, repair or replacement receipts or the estimated cost therefor, and
provided further that the landlord has complied with any requested walk through inspection, as provided in subsection A3 of this section, and has
included, as part of such notice, any inspection checklists disclosing that the damage in question occurred while the rental premises were occupied
by the tenant. If an estimated cost is given, the landlord shall furnish the tenant with paid receipts or copies thereof within thirty (30) days from the
date the statement showing an estimated cost was furnished to the tenant, as required by this subsection. In the event no such notice or notices with
the required statements, checklists, and evidence of estimated costs, if required, is furnished to the tenant as provided herein, then the landlord shall
return the security deposit in full to the tenant within forty five (45) days of the date that the tenant vacated the rental unit. For purposes of this
provision, the decorating of a rental unit after a tenant's departure, including painting and rug shampooing, shall not be considered as damage and
the cost thereof shall not be charged to the security deposit unless the rental agreement specifically provides that painting and rug shampooing are
included as a part of the tenant's cleaning responsibility upon vacating the rental unit.
3. Where requested by either party to a rental agreement, a walk through inspection shall be made by the landlord and tenant, prior to the
commencement of the rental term and/or again at the termination thereof and an inspection checklist of all damaged or missing items shall be made
at the time of the walk through inspection and a copy thereof furnished to each party. Such request shall be in writing, shall be personally served not
less than forty eight (48) hours, or mailed not less than five (5) business days before the date of the requested inspection and such inspections shall
be conducted, unless otherwise agreed, on the landlord's regular business days and during his regular business hours. Items, which are checked as
missing or damaged prior to commencement of the rental term, shall not be charged against the security deposit of the tenant. Upon request of the
landlord or tenant, a representative of the village's environmental health department may accompany the parties on such walk through inspections.
Where a walk through inspection is requested, as provided herein, no portion of a security deposit shall be applied against damages incurred to a
rental unit, unless the notice of damages required in subsection A2 of this section, includes the completed inspection checklist(s) showing the
occurrence of such damage during the rental term.
4. Landlord's notice of the reasons for retaining the security deposit, as set forth in subsection A2 of this section, and either party's request for a walk
through inspection, as set forth in subsection A3 of this section, must be sent certified mail, receipt requested, or served personally, in which case the
party receiving the request, which may include the respective landlord, landlord's agent, lessee, or member of the household over the age of twelve
(12), must be requested to sign in receipt thereof on a duplicate copy of the notice or request. Evidence that the notice or request was sent certified
mail and signed for or otherwise returned, or that receipt of the notice or request was acknowledged on a duplicate copy, shall create a rebuttable
presumption of delivery.
5. If the landlord fails to comply with the provisions hereof, the tenant may recover the property and money due him together with such damages, costs
and fees as a court shall determine and award.
6. This section does not preclude the landlord or tenant from exercising other remedies to which he may be entitled under this article.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 649/724
1. The landlord, from time to time, may adopt general rules or regulations concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. They are
enforceable only if:
a. Their purpose is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive use or
make a fair distribution of services and facilities among tenants;
b. They are reasonably related to the purpose for which they are adopted;
c. They apply to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;
d. They are sufficiently explicit to fairly inform the tenant of what he must or must not do to comply;
e. They are not for the purpose of evading the obligation of the landlord; and
f. They are attached to the rental agreement so that the tenant has notice of them at the time he enters into the rental agreement.
2. A rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental agreement that substantially modifies his lease agreement is not enforceable
unless the tenant consents to it or unless a change in local, state or federal law requires the regulation change. The term "substantially modifies"
shall mean a change which significantly affects the use of the premises or its fair rental value.
C. Disclosure:
1. The landlord or any person authorized to enter into a rental agreement on his/her behalf shall disclose to the tenant in writing on or before the
commencement of the tenancy:
a. The name and address of the owner; and
b. The name, address and telephone number of the property manager, if any.
2. A person who fails to comply with subsection C1 of this section becomes an agent of each person who is a landlord for:
a. Service of process and receiving of notices and demands; and
b. Performing the obligations of the landlord under this article and under the rental agreement.
3. The information required to be furnished by subsection C1 of this section shall be kept current. Subsections C1 and C2 of this section extend to and
are enforceable against any successor landlord or property manager.
4. Before a tenant initially enters into or renews a rental agreement for a rental unit, the landlord or any person authorized to enter into a rental
agreement on his behalf shall disclose to the tenant in writing any existing code violations which have been cited by the village for the rental unit. If
the landlord fails to comply with this subsection C4, the tenant may pursue the remedies provided in section 23.1808 of this article.
D. Maintenance Of Premises:
1. The landlord shall maintain the premises in substantial compliance with applicable codes of the village and shall promptly make any and all repairs
necessary to fulfill this obligation.
2. The landlord and tenant of any rental unit may agree that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations or remodeling
only if:
a. The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord or tenant and is set
forth in a separate writing signed by the parties and supported by adequate consideration; and
b. The agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the landlord to other tenants in the premises.
E. Access To Rental Unit:
1. The landlord shall not abuse the right of access to the rental unit or use it to harass the tenant. Except in cases of emergency, the landlord shall give
the tenant reasonable notice of his or her intent to enter and if at all practical may enter the unit only between eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. and eight
o'clock (8:00) P.M. The landlord may enter a rental unit only for the following purposes:

e. To show the dwelling unit to prospective purchasers, mortgagees, tenants or workers.
2. The landlord may enter the rental unit without consent of the tenant in case of emergency. For purposes of this provision, the term "emergency" shall
refer to a situation wherein access to the rental unit is necessary in order to prevent damage or destruction to the unit, or to the fixtures, equipment,
appliances, furniture and other personal property contained therein, or in order to protect any person from injury. Nonpayment or delinquent payment
of rent shall not constitute an emergency.
F. Limitation On Liability:
1. Unless otherwise agreed, a landlord who sells the premises is relieved of liability under the rental agreement and this article for events occurring
subsequent to notice to the tenant that the sale has occurred. However, he remains liable to the tenant for any property and money to which the
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 650/724
tenant is entitled under subsection 23.1806A of this article and all unpaid rent unless the tenant receives notice that such property, money and
prepaid rent have been transferred to the buyer, and that the buyer has accepted liability for such property, money and prepaid rent.
2. Unless otherwise agreed, the property manager is relieved of liability under the rental agreement for events occurring after notice to the tenant of the
termination of its management.
G. Receipts: Upon request of the tenant, a landlord must provide a written receipt for any payment made (i.e., rent, security deposits, etc.). If payment is
made by personal check, the canceled check shall be considered a receipt. (Ord. 3366, 9-6-1983; amd. Ord. 4728, 5-16-1995; Ord. 4868, 6-17-1997;
Ord. 5536, 1-17-2006; Ord. 5896, 12-20-2011)
23.1807: LANDLORD REMEDIES:
A. Breach Of Rental Agreement:
1. If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay the unpaid rent within five (5) days after notice by the landlord of the intention to terminate the
rental agreement if the rent is not so paid, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement or he may accept a payment made more than five (5)
days after such notice in which case he shall be entitled to collect a late payment fee in the amount of five percent (5%) of the rental payment.
2. If there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or with section 23.1805 of this article, other than nonpayment of rent, the
landlord may give notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a
date not less than ten (10) days after receipt of the notice unless the breach is remedied by the tenant within the ten (10) day period, or as promptly
as conditions permit in case of an emergency.
3. In the alternative, if there is material noncompliance by the tenant with section 23.1805 of this article, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit and
have the work done in a workmanlike manner and submit a receipted bill from an appropriate tradesman for the cost thereof as rent on the next day
when rent is due, or if the rental agreement has terminated, for immediate payment, provided that the landlord has fulfilled his affirmative obligations
under subsections 23.1806C and D of this article.
4. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall have a claim for possession and for rent and a separate claim for injunctive relief, his actual
damages for breach of the rental agreement or the tenant's noncompliance with section 23.1805 of this article, and his costs and fees, as hereinafter
provided. If the tenant's noncompliance is wilful, the landlord may recover such additional costs and fees as a court shall determine to award.
B. Abandonment Of Rental Unit, Sublease:
1. For purposes of this Section, "abandonment of the rental unit" shall mean that the tenant has vacated the premises, or has been absent therefrom
for ten (10) or more consecutive days without advising the landlord of such absence or intent to return, and that his rent is in default and that notice
by the landlord to terminate the rental agreement as provided in subsection A of this Section has expired.
2. If the tenant abandons the rental unit, the landlord shall:
a. Terminate the lease and proceed with his remedies as set forth in this Article, or;
b. Make a good faith effort to rent it at the rent specified in the tenant's rental agreement or at an amount equal to the prevailing rent for similar units
within the same multi-family rental structure. This shall include the acceptance of reasonable subleases. If the landlord succeeds in renting the
rental unit at a fair rental, the tenant shall be liable for the amount by which the rent due from the date of abandonment to the termination of the
initial rental agreement exceeds the fair rental subsequently received by the landlord from the date of abandonment to the termination of the initial
rental agreement. If the landlord makes a good faith effort to rent the rental unit at a fair rental and is unsuccessful, the tenant shall be liable for the
rent due for the period of the rental agreement. In either event, the tenant shall be liable for the advertising expenses and reasonable redecoration
costs incurred by the landlord in rerenting the rental unit.
C. Disposition Of Abandoned Property: Where, following termination of the rental agreement (other than by order of a court) the tenant surrenders or
vacates the rental unit or abandons the same leaving behind items of his personal property, such personal property may be considered by the landlord
to be abandoned personal property and the landlord may dispose of the same in such manner as he determines. In the event the landlord sells the
property, the sale proceeds shall be credited against any rent or other sums due to the landlord by the tenant in accordance with the rental agreement
and this Article.
D. Waiver Of Right To Terminate: Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant, or acceptance of performance by the tenant that varies
from the terms of the rental agreement or rules or regulations subsequently adopted by the landlord, must be confirmed in writing and signed by both
parties and only then constitutes a waiver of the landlord's right to terminate the rental agreement for that breach. (Ord. 3366, 9-6-1983; Ord. 4728, 5-
16-1995)
23.1808: TENANT REMEDIES:
A. Breach Of Rental Agreement:
1. If there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with subsections 23.1806C and D of this Article, the tenant may
give notice to the landlord specifying the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate on a date not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt
of the notice if the breach is not remedied by that time. If the breach is not remedied by the landlord within fourteen (14) days, the rental agreement
shall terminate as provided in the notice. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the
tenant, a member of his family, or other person on the premises with his consent.
2. Except as provided in this Article, the tenant may recover actual damages and obtain injunctive relief for any material noncompliance by the landlord
with the rental agreement, or with subsection 23.1806D of this Article. If the landlord's noncompliance is wilful, the tenant may recover such
additional costs and fees as a court shall determine and award.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 651/724
3. If the rental agreement is terminated pursuant to this subsection, the landlord shall return all security and interest recoverable by the tenant under
subsection 23.1806A of this Article and all prepaid rent.
B. Failure To Deliver Possession:
1. If the landlord fails to deliver possession of the rental unit to the tenant in compliance with the rental agreement and subsection 23.1806D of this
Article, rent abates until possession is properly delivered and the tenant may:
a. Upon not less than five (5) days' notice to the landlord, terminate the rental agreement and upon termination the landlord shall return all prepaid
rent and security; or
b. Demand performance of the rental agreement by the landlord and, if the tenant elects, maintain an action for possession of the rental unit against
the landlord or any person wrongfully in possession and recover the damages actually sustained by him.
2. If a landlord's failure to deliver possession is wilful, an aggrieved person may recover from the landlord an amount totalling not more than two (2)
months' rent, and such damages, costs and fees as a court shall determine and award.
C. Failure To Supply Essential Services:
1. If, contrary to the rental agreement, the landlord fails to supply heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas or plumbing to the rental unit, and
where the condition was not caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of his family or other person on the
premises with his consent, or by the inability of a utility supplier to provide such service, the tenant may give notice to the landlord or his agent or
representative, which notice shall request the landlord either to restore such services or, in the alternative, to obtain, at the landlord's expense,
suitable substitute housing for the tenant within the immediate vicinity of the rental unit for temporary use until such time as the services in question
are restored.
2. In the event that the landlord fails to restore services or to provide substitute housing for the tenant within a period of thirty six (36) hours following
receipt of notice, then the tenant may:
a. If continued occupancy is lawful (as determined by the Village), remain in the rental unit and take such steps reasonably necessary to procure
alternative sources of heat or light, or other affected services during the period of the landlord's noncompliance, and deduct the cost thereof from
the rent, which such alternate sources shall fully comply with Village codes; or
b. If continued occupancy is lawful (as determined by the Village), remain in the rental unit and recover damages based upon the diminution in the
fair rental value of the rental unit together with such costs and fees as a court shall determine and award; or
c. Procure substitute housing during the period of the landlord's noncompliance or the lease term, whichever is shorter, making good faith efforts to
obtain comparable housing at a cost similar to the rent paid by the tenant for the rental unit, where available, in which case the tenant shall be
excused from paying rent for the period of the landlord's noncompliance. The tenant may recover the excess cost of procuring substitute housing
which exceeds the monthly rent amount, including moving expenses, and such other costs and fees as a court shall determine and award. If the
tenant proceeds under this subsection, he may not proceed under any other subsections for such breach.
3. If the Village or any department of the Village expends funds on behalf of the tenant for repairs, services or substitute housing, the Village shall have
a lien for those funds on any amounts recoverable by the tenants from the landlord. This lien may be satisfied by requiring that rents be paid directly
to the Village until the amount of the lien is fully paid.
D. Failure To Maintain Unit In Good Repair:
1. In addition to the provision in this Section pertaining to a failure of the landlord to supply essential services, where the landlord breaches his
obligations to render the rental unit habitable and maintain the same in good repair, the tenant may:
a. Where the breach involves a Code violation cited by the Village, notify the landlord of the intention to withhold from the monthly rent an amount
which reasonably reflects the reduced value of the premises or the cost of obtaining compliance, but not exceeding seventy five percent (75%) of
the monthly rent. If the landlord fails to correct the condition within seven (7) days after being notified by the tenant, the tenant may, during the time
such failure continues, deduct from the rent the stated amount.
b. If, after twenty one (21) days from the giving of notice the matter has not been resolved, the landlord or tenant may pursue available remedies at
law or in equity.
2. A tenant may not withhold rent under this Section if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member
of his family or other person on the premises with his consent.
3. Where the noncompliance condition affects facilities shared by more than one dwelling unit, and the Village has issued a citation for the alleged
noncompliance as a violation of the applicable provisions of the Village Code, the Village may notify all other tenants sharing such facilities, by
regular mail, with respect to the implementation of this subsection. Provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall obligate the landlord, his
representative or his agent to disclose to the Village the names of its tenants.
E. Counterclaim To Action For Possession Or Rent:
1. In an action by the landlord for possession based upon nonpayment of rent or in an action for rent where the tenant is in possession, the tenant may
counterclaim for any amount which he may recover under the rental agreement or this Article. In that event, the court may order the tenant to pay
into court all or part of the rent accrued and thereafter accruing, and shall determine the amount due to each party. The party to whom a net amount
is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into court, and the balance by the other party. If no rent remains due after application of this Section,
judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession. If the defense or counterclaim by tenant is without merit, the landlord may
recover such costs and fees as a court shall determine and award.
2. In an action for rent where the tenant is not in possession, the tenant may counterclaim as provided in subsection E1 of this Section, but the tenant is
not required to pay any rent into court.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 652/724
F. Fire Or Casualty Damage:
1. If the rental unit or premises is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty to an extent that enjoyment of the rental unit is substantially impaired,
and the fire or other casualty damage was not caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of his family or a person
on the premises with his consent, the tenant may:
a. If continued occupancy is lawful (as determined by the Village), vacate any part of the rental unit rendered unusable by the fire or other casualty, in
which case the tenant's liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair rental value of the rental unit; or
b. If continued occupancy is unlawful, immediately vacate the premises and notify the landlord within fourteen (14) days thereafter of his intention to
terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the date of vacating; or

entitled to terminate the rental agreement and in either case recover an amount equal to not more than two (2) months' rent and such damages, costs
and fees as a court shall determine and award. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all security and interest recoverable
under subsection 23.1806A of this Article and all prepaid rent. Such conduct of a landlord subsequent to tenant activities described above in
subsection A of this Section without justifiable cause may be considered retaliation.
C. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this Section, a landlord may bring an action for possession if:
1. The violation of a code was caused primarily by lack of care by the tenant, a member of his family or other person on the premises with his consent;
or

23.1813: CHRONIC PUBLIC NUISANCE:
A. Declaration Of Chronic Public Nuisance Property: It shall be unlawful and a nuisance for any person to intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently
permit any rental unit and/or multi-family residential structure within the village to become, exist or be used as a chronic public nuisance, and any
chronic public nuisances found to exist within the village shall be subject to abatement in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section,
"multi-family residential structure" shall include the land which is affixed, incidental or pertinent to that structure, including, but not limited to, any
parking area, common area, premises, room, house, building or structure, or any separate part or portion thereof.
B. Preabatement Procedure: Whenever the chief of police, or his/her designee, receives one police report of any law enforcement agency lawfully
exercising jurisdiction in the village, which reports or describes public nuisance activity within the village within the same one year period by a tenant(s),
any member of the tenant's household, tenant's guest(s), and any person under tenant's control, of the same rental unit or the same multi-family
residential structure, the chief of police, or his/her designee, may take the following action:
1. Notify the landlord that the property may be in danger of becoming a chronic public nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following
information:
a. The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the dwelling unit and/or at a multi-family residential structure.
b. A statement that the chief of police has information that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic public nuisance property with a concise
description of the public nuisance activities that may exist or that have occurred. Said notice shall further state the following:
(1) Demand that corrective action be taken to ensure that a second or subsequent public nuisance activity (in the event of a felony offense related
to the same rental unit) or a third or subsequent public nuisance activity does not occur in regard to the same rental unit within that one year
period, or, in the case of a multi-family residential structure, to ensure that a sixth or subsequent public nuisance activity does not occur within
that one year period;
(2) Explain that, in the event of a subsequent occurrence of a public nuisance activity on that property, the chief of police may declare the property
a chronic public nuisance, such that the landlord's residential operator's license shall be subject to suspension or revocation;
(3) Recommend that landlord enforce the crime free lease provision through eviction or take such other reasonable corrective action as the chief of
police deems necessary; and
(4) Notify the landlord that it has the right to request a hearing before the village manager to contest the determination of an occurrence of public
nuisance activity. Said request for a hearing must be received by the village manager within eight (8) days following the date such notice was
personally delivered or placed in the mail. If such a request for a hearing is not received within that time period, the police chief's determination
shall become final.
c. Said notice shall be served by regular U.S. mail or by personal service.
2. Whenever the chief of police, or his/her designee, receives subsequent police reports of any law enforcement agency lawfully exercising jurisdiction
in the village, which report or describe a second or subsequent public nuisance activity in regard to the same rental unit or a second, third, fourth, or
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 654/724
fifth or subsequent public nuisance activity in regard to the same multi-family residential structure within the same one year period, the chief of police,
or his/her designee, shall send a notice in the form set forth in subsection B1 of this section. For purposes of this section, it is not necessary that
notices be sent for each public nuisance activity that may occur, but that two (2) preabatement notices be sent in regard to public nuisance activities
at a rental unit, and five (5) preabatement notices be sent in regard to such activities at a multi-family residential structure, prior to commencement of
the abatement proceedings set forth below. If the first or second public nuisance activity in regard to the same rental unit is a felony offense, a
second preabatement notice is not required.
C. Abatement Procedure: If, after complying with the notification procedures described in subsection B of this section, the chief of police receives a police
report documenting the occurrence of a second public nuisance activity, one of which public nuisances is a felony offense, or a third or subsequent
public nuisance activity in regard to the same rental unit and/or receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a sixth or subsequent public
nuisance activity in regard to the same multi-family residential structure within one year of the acts or conduct with respect to which a notification was
issued, and determines that the property has become a chronic public nuisance property, the chief of police shall:
1. Notify the landlord of the rental unit and/or multi-family residential structure that the property has been declared a chronic public nuisance property.
The notice shall contain the following information:
a. The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property.
b. A statement that the chief of police has determined the property to be a chronic public nuisance property with a concise description of the public
nuisance activities leading to that finding.

subsection 10.401C of this code.
d. Said notice shall be served by regular U.S. mail, or by personal service.
D. Burden Of Proof, Notice:
1. In an action seeking abatement of a chronic public nuisance property by revocation or suspension of the landlord's residential operator's license, the
village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic public nuisance property.
2. For purposes of showing that the property is a chronic public nuisance property and that a public nuisance has occurred within the village, the
testimony of police officers to recount witness statements shall be admissible, subject to the discretion of the hearing officer.
3. The following are defenses to an action seeking suspension or revocation of a residential operator's license:
a. That the landlord, at the time in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a
chronic public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings
that the property is a chronic public nuisance property.
b. That the public nuisance activities occurring at a rental unit were not related to the same tenant. Public nuisance activities at a rental unit are
subject to abatement under this section, if they occur while the rental unit is leased to the same tenant.
4. The failure of any person to receive the notices in subsections B and C of this section shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under
this section.
E. Eviction Or Retaliation Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for an owner to terminate the lease agreement of a tenant or otherwise retaliate against any
tenant because that tenant complained to the police chief about nuisance activities on the owner's premises. Such eviction or retaliation shall be
enforceable as a violation of subsection 23.1809A of this article. (Ord. 5619, 3-6-2007; amd. Ord. 5896, 12-20-2011)
23.1814: CRIME FREE HOUSING:
A. A residential operator's license shall not be issued until the landlord, or designated agent, has attended and successfully completed the crime free
housing seminar, sponsored by the Village of Mount Prospect.
B. In the event that a landlord makes application for a residential operator's license and has met all other license requirements, but a crime free housing
seminar is not available, a conditional license may be issued, effective no more than three (3) months from the date of issuance, subject to attendance
and successful completion by the landlord, or his/her designated agent, of that seminar within that time period. Upon completion of the seminar within
that time period, a residential operator's license shall be issued for the balance of the year.
C. In the event that a designated agent attended the crime free housing seminar to comply with this section, and that agent is no longer employed by the
landlord or designated by the landlord to be responsible for managing the rental unit and/or multi-family residential structure under the residential
operator's license, the landlord, or a newly designated agent, shall attend and successfully complete the seminar within three (3) months of that event.
D. An owner of a rental unit or multi-family residential structure may be certified as a residential operator upon issuance of a residential operator's license,
a security certificate, and a certificate of completion of the community awareness training program presented by the Mount Prospect police department.
The certification as a residential operator shall be issued on an annual basis subject to annual compliance with these requirements.
E. At any time after two (2) years from the date of the issuance of a residential operator's license, a landlord or designated agent may be required to attend
and successfully complete the crime free housing seminar. Such requirement shall be subject to the recommendation of the crime free housing
coordinator to the village manager, who shall consider the following in making such determination:
1. Whether the rental unit or multi-family residential structure, subject to the residential operator's license, is in danger of becoming a nuisance
residential rental property as defined in this article, and
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 655/724
2. Whether criminal activity is occurring on the premises and the landlord has failed to initiate eviction proceedings or take other appropriate action.
A residential operator's license shall not be renewed if attendance is required and not completed within three (3) months of the notice to that effect.
Such notice shall be delivered or mailed to the landlord, or designated agent, at the address designated on the most recent license application.
F. A crime free housing coordinator, to be designated by the chief of police, shall provide the finance director with a list of landlords and/or designated
agents, who have attended the crime free housing seminar and/or are certified residential operators, along with the dates of attendance and verification
that the landlord or designated agent has otherwise complied with this code to be eligible for issuance or renewal of a residential operator's license.
G. After February 1, 2012, every lease, including lease extensions, shall contain a crime free lease provision, the purpose of which is to make criminal
activity, not limited to violent or drug related criminal activity, engaged by, facilitated by or permitted by the lessee, member of the household, guest or
other party under the control of the lessee, a lease violation, and to provide the landlord with authority under that clause to initiate eviction proceedings
pursuant to state law. The crime free lease provision shall be in substantially the following form:
Crime Free Housing Lease Provision
Prohibition against criminal
activity within the
Village of Mount Prospect.
1. The Tenant, any member of the tenant's household, Tenant's guest(s), and any person under Tenant's control shall not engage in or facilitate

premises to be used for, or to facilitate, criminal activity, regardless of whether the individual engaging in such activity is a member of the
household, or a guest.
3. The Tenant, any member of the tenant's household, Tenant's guest(s), and any person under Tenant's control shall not engage in or facilitate
any breach of the lease agreement that jeopardizes the health, safety, and welfare of the landlord, his agent, or other tenant, or involves imminent
or actual serious property damage.
4. The Tenant is vicariously liable for the criminal activity of any member of the Tenant's household, Tenant's guest(s), and any person under
Tenant's control, whether or not the Tenant had knowledge of the activity or whether or not the household member or guest was under the Tenant's
control.
5. VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE ABOVE PROVISIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL AND IRREPARABLE VIOLATION OF THE LEASE AND
GOOD CAUSE FOR TERMINATION OF THE TENANCY. A single violation of any of the provisions of this added addendum shall be a serious
violation and may constitute material non-compliance with the lease. It is understood and agreed that a single violation may constitute good cause
for IMMEDIATE termination of the lease under the Illinois Compiled Statutes; provided, however, that a violation shall not be good cause to
terminate the tenancy if the immediate termination of the lease would violate Section 1-2-1.5 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1.5).
Unless otherwise provided by law, proof of violation may not require criminal conviction, BUT SHALL BE BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE
SPECIFIC EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE VIOLATION. Tenant consents to venue in any justice court precinct within the county wherein the unit
is located in the event Owner initiates legal action against the Tenant. Tenant hereby waives any objection to any venue chosen by owner.

will not be in violation of this Crime Free Lease Provision. Nothing in this Provision prohibits the eviction of the perpetrator of the domestic
violence, sexual violence, or other criminal activity. A TENANT IS ENCOURAGED TO REPORT CRIMES WITHOUT FEAR OF HIS/HER STATUS
AS A TENANT.
7. A Tenant will not be in violation of this Crime Free Lease Addendum and it shall not constitute a public nuisance under the Village Code based
on the following:
a) Contact made to the police or seeking other emergency services, if (i) the contact was made with the intent to prevent or respond to domestic
violence or sexual violence; (ii) the intervention or emergency assistance was needed to respond to or prevent domestic violence or sexual
violence; or (iii) the contact was made by, on behalf of, or otherwise concerns an individual with a disability and the purpose of the contact was
related to that individual's disability;
b) An incident or incidents of actual or threatened domestic violence or sexual violence against the tenant, household member, or guest
occurring in the rental unit or on the premises; or
c) Criminal activity or a local ordinance violation occurring in the rental unit or on the premises that is directly relating to domestic violence or
sexual violence, engaged in by a tenant, member of a tenant's household, guest, or other party, and against a tenant, household member, guest
or other party.
8. In case of conflict between the provisions of this addendum and any other provisions of the lease, the provisions of this addendum shall govern.
For purposes of this Lease Section, the meaning of criminal activity shall include: Homicide, Child Pornography, Soliciting for a Prostitute,
Pandering, Keeping a Place of Prostitution, Harmful Material to Minors, Mob Action, Bodily Harm, Theft, Possession of Explosives or Incendiary
Devices, Deadly Weapons, Prostitution, Interference with Public Officers, Disorderly Conduct, Gambling, Purchase or Acceptance of Gift of Liquor

A. Inspection Requirements; License Issuance Or Denial:
1. Each multi-family rental structure and each unit within the structure shall be subject to inspection, in accordance with this section, for compliance
with all applicable regulations. A license may be denied if the structure or a unit within the structure has been inspected and is not in compliance with
applicable regulations or outstanding fees or judgments exist. In such a case, the licensee may apply for a conditional license.
2. Initial and subsequent annual licensing inspections shall be conducted on a regular schedule and include the building exterior, common areas,
basement and not less than twenty percent (20%) of the individual dwelling units. All units within the structure shall be inspected every five (5) years
unless inspections are required less frequently pursuant to the incentive provisions of this article. However, no multi-family structure which is less

such an inspection. The age of the structure shall be established from the date of the original certificate of occupancy or, if not available, by proof
otherwise acceptable to the village.
3. An owner may elect to have inspections conducted on an "as vacant" basis, in which case the village must be given two (2) weeks' advance notice
to schedule an inspection before a vacant unit is to be reoccupied. If a violation, other than a warning condition, is found during such an inspection,

under or on the door of the unit at least seventy two (72) hours prior to the inspection. The form shall contain a certification that the owner has served
such notice. Such notices shall inform the owner and occupant, respectively, of their right to refuse to consent to the inspection and to require the

applicable regulations. The exterior of such structures shall also be subject to inspection as part of the village's routine property maintenance
program. Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with subsections A6 through A9 and A11 of this section.

property for any inspection pursuant to this article, the code official or designee may, upon approval of the village manager, apply to the circuit court
for an administrative warrant or other appropriate court order authorizing such inspection. Such an application shall not be a waiver of the village's
right to seek other remedies pursuant to this article.

correction of warning conditions. Failure to comply with such a time period shall be a violation of this article.

placed in the mail. If such a request for a hearing is not received within that time period, the code official's determination shall become final.
e. An explanation that all violations and warning conditions must be corrected within the compliance time period, or fees, charges, and liens, as
described in section 23.1817 of this article, may result, and the license will be subject to suspension, revocation and nonrenewal.

the owner shall be responsible for all enforcement fees associated with the property until the violations are corrected.
10. The director shall monitor compliance with the notice of violation through periodic tracking and inspection of the repair status. Once a notice of
violation has been sent, the owner shall be responsible for all enforcement fees associated with the property.
11. A licensing reinspection will be conducted at the request of the owner(s).
12. If during a licensing inspection or reinspection any dwelling unit is determined to be unfit for human occupancy pursuant to the village's property
maintenance code, an additional twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units in the subject multi-family rental property shall be inspected. If similar

VACANT, NONCOMPLYING AND IMMEDIATE HAZARD STRUCTURES
23.2501: STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
A. From time to time there are structures within the village that are not in compliance with village regulations, have become a threat to life and property or
are vacant or abandoned. Therefore, the village board of Mount Prospect makes the following findings and declarations:
1. Noncomplying structures must promptly be made safe and secure to protect the public safety and are declared to be a nuisance subject to the
abatement process set forth in this article.
2. Noncomplying structures are dangerous and unsafe in that they are extremely vulnerable to fire, flooding, collapse or other hazards.
3. Noncomplying structures are a blight on their neighborhoods, cause deterioration and instability in their neighborhoods and have an adverse impact
upon other properties.
4. Structures that were previously used or occupied and have since become vacant have a significant and detrimental impact on the local real estate
market.
5. Structures that are vacant and not properly secured attract vagrants and criminals and are prime locations to conduct illegal activities, including
arson and drug use.
6. Structures that are vacant and unsecured pose serious threats to the public's health and safety and therefore are public nuisances.

neighborhoods with the consequent adverse impact on the value of adjacent and nearby properties. Such actions are also necessary to secure the
public safety and to ensure and enhance the vitality and livability of our neighborhoods.
8. Communication between owners of noncomplying structures and the village is essential for effective allocation of public resources and the
maintenance of public health, welfare and safety in regards to such structures.

Footnote 1: Unless reference is made to an amending ordinance at the end of each section, subsection or paragraph contained in this Chapter 18, said provisions are
deemed to be from Ordinance 2609, passed February 17, 1976.
Article I
TITLE; INTERPRETATION
25.101: TITLE OF CODE:
This code shall be known as the MUNICIPAL CODE OF MOUNT PROSPECT. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same under its appropriate chapter heading, its article heading, if any, and to the penalty clause relating thereto,
as well as to the section itself, when reference is made to this code by title in any legal document or ordinance of the village. (1957 Code, 24.101)
25.102: CONSTRUING THIS CODE:
Whenever any word importing the plural number is used in describing or referring to any matters, parties or persons, any single matter, party or person
shall be deemed to be included, although distributive words may not have been used. When any subject matter, party or person is referred to in this code
by words importing the singular number only, or the masculine gender, several matters, parties or persons and females as well as males and bodies
corporate shall be deemed to be included. If a requirement or prohibition is applied to a licensee or permittee, then the requirement or prohibition shall also
apply to any agent, employee or person acting on behalf of the licensee or permittee. The word "persons" or the words "person, firm or corporation" shall
include an individual, organization, entity, corporation, proprietorship, partnership, firm, association, trade union, trust, estate or group as well as any
parent or beneficiary of any of the foregoing entities, whether or not operated for profit. Words in the present shall include the future. The words "the
ordinance" whenever used in this code, shall be held and taken to mean the entire code, including each and every section. The word "village" whenever
used in this code shall be held and taken to mean the village of Mount Prospect. The words "written" or "in writing" may include printing. These rules of
construction shall not be applied to any section of this code which contains any express provisions excluding such construction or where the subject matter
or content of such section may be repugnant to such construction. (Ord. 5685, 4-15-2008)
25.103: DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHOLESALER AND RETAILER:
In all cases where the words "wholesale" or "wholesale dealer" are used in this code, unless otherwise specifically defined, they shall be understood to
relate to the sale of goods, merchandise, articles or things in quantity to persons who purchase for the purpose of resale, as distinguished from a retail
dealer who sells in smaller quantities direct to the consumer. (1957 Code, 24.103)
25.104: PENALTIES:
In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by different classes or sections of this code, the prosecuting officer may elect under
which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be against the same person for the same offense; provided that the revocation of a license or
permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced.
A. Whenever in this code a minimum but not maximum fine or penalty is imposed, the court may in its discretion fine the offender any sum exceeding the
minimum fine or penalty but not exceeding the maximum amount set forth in appendix A, division III of this code. Unless otherwise stated, the minimum
and maximum fines shall be as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code.
1/14/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=802 687/724
B. Whenever in this code the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code, and there shall be
no fine or penalty declared for such breach, any person who shall be found guilty of any such breach shall be fined an amount set forth in appendix A,
division III of this code, for each offense.
C. In any case involving a violation of this code or any ordinance of this village upon: 1) a plea of guilty, or 2) a stipulation by the defendant to the facts
supporting the charge, or 3) a finding of guilt after trial, the court, in its sole discretion, may defer further proceedings and the imposition of a penalty
and enter an order for supervision of the defendant. In determining whether supervision is appropriate, the court shall consider the circumstances of the
offense and the history, character and condition of the defendant. Supervision shall be ordered if the court is of the opinion that:
1. The defendant is not likely to commit further ordinance violations or crimes;
2. The defendant and the public would best be served if the offense were not on the defendant's record;
3. In the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a penalty otherwise permitted under this code.
No order of supervision shall be entered in any matter where the defendant has previously been placed on supervision by any court for any ordinance
or statute violation committed less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the instant offense. Under no circumstances shall any person be placed
on supervision for violation of this code if such person has been previously placed on supervision for any offense two (2) or more times.
Such imprisonment or assignment shall not be subject to suspension nor shall the person be eligible for probation in order to reduce the sentence or
assignment. The court may impose a fine less than as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, only where, after an evidentiary hearing, the
court determines that: 1) such person is not financially able to pay a fine, as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, over the course of one
year; and 2) payment of a fine, as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, would cause undue hardship to someone dependent upon such
person for support; and 3) it is in the best interest of justice to impose a fine less than as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code. In any case
where a fine less than set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, is imposed, the court shall order such person to perform one hour of community
service for a dollar amount, as set forth in appendix A, division III of this code, by which penalty amount as set forth in appendix A, division III of this
code, exceeds the fine imposed.
D. If this code applies any fee, fine or penalty requirement to any tenant or occupier of a premises because of that person's use or occupancy of that
particular land or that particular premises; the occupant or tenant and the owner or landlord shall be jointly and severally liable for such fee, fine or
penalty. This subsection shall not apply to criminal or quasi-criminal activities of a tenant or landlord, except to the extent such activities are the cause
of code violations pertaining to the condition of the premises. (1957 Code, 24.104; amd. Ord. 3168, 12-15-1981; Ord. 5189, 5-15-2001; Ord. 5367, 9-2-
2003; Ord. 5518, 11-1-2005)
25.105: OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES:
A. Whenever reference is made in this code to a village officer or employee by title only, this shall be construed as though followed by the words "of the
village of Mount Prospect" and shall be taken to mean the officer or employee of this village having the title mentioned or performing the duties
mentioned.
B. No provision of this code designating the duties of any officer or employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine
or penalty provided in this code for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of the village board to impose such fine or penalty on such officer
or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty. (1957 Code, 24.105)
25.106: INTENT:
All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent of the board of
trustees may be fully carried out. (1957 Code, 24.106)
25.107: SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:
If any chapter, section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this code or any part thereof or any other ordinance of the village
is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or
effectiveness of the remaining portions of this code or particular ordinance, or any part thereof. The village board of trustees hereby declares that it would
have adopted each chapter, section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of that fact that any one or more
chapters, sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective. (Ord. 4789,
