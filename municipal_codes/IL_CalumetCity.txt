PREFACE 
This Code is a recodification of the 1980 Municipal Code of Calumet City, Illinois, containing ordinances of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation representing a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(1)  To receive and register complaints and information concerning corruption, fraud, waste, mismanagement, unlawful political discrimination and misconduct in the operations of city government; including, but not limited to any city contract, grant, lease, license, or application or certification of eligibility for the same; all city employees, departments, bureaus, boards, agencies, agents, or independent contractors; and appointed officials, in the performance of their official duties; contractors and subcontractors providing goods and services pursuant to a city contract; and all persons and business entities seeking city contracts or certification of eligibility for city contracts.

The OIIG shall acquiesce in its investigation only upon written request of another law enforcement agency. 
(7)  To serve as liaison between city government and law enforcement authorities regarding any matters which have been referred to such authorities by the independent inspector general.

Within constitutional limitations, failure by any city employee, official, agent, contractor, sub-contractor, licensee, grantee or person or business seeking city contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility for city contracts, to cooperate with any reasonable request by the OIIG carries the threat of sanctions and/or criminal contempt proceedings, and any other penalties the city council has within its scope to assess.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 14-1. - Point-of-sale inspection requirement; certificate of compliance procedures. 
(a)  Department created; definition; general requirement. 
(1)  A department of inspectional services is hereby created pursuant to this section. The department of inspectional services ("department") shall be headed by a director of inspectional services ("director," which shall also include the director's designees) who shall be appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the city council. All inspectional services concerning point-of-sale matters within the city, including building and housing, shall be under the jurisdiction of the department. The building commissioner, electrical inspector, plumbing inspector, housing director and all department inspectors and staff shall be responsible for reporting to the director relative to all matters relating to this section and the director shall have full authority to direct, train and provide appropriate personnel subject to city council approval as to expenditures and/or requirements as provided herein. 
(2)  For the purpose of this section, the term "point-of-sale inspection" means an inspection of real property by the department conducted in connection with a taxable transfer of real estate to determine whether the condition of said property conforms to the specific regulations identified in this section. 
(3)  A point-of-sale inspection shall be required relative to any transfer of any interest in property which is subject to this section, except as exempted herein. 
(b)  Notice of transfer of real property required. Whenever an owner of real property in the city proposes to engage in a transfer of real property in the city which is subject to taxation under chapter 82, article X of the Calumet City Municipal Code (real estate transfer tax), such owner shall provide the department a notice of transfer for said property, on a form therefor provided by the department. 
(c)  Compliance inspection; pertinent code requirements. The notice of transfer form shall also constitute the director's request to inspect such property ("compliance inspection") to determine whether such property is in compliance with the following specific requirements, which the corporate authorities of the city find are related to the public health, safety and welfare: 
(1)  Compliance with property maintenance code. All structure shall be in compliance with article X, sections 14-691 and 14-692 of this chapter 14, "property maintenance code." 
(2)  Inspection to determine possible illegal conversions. All structures shall be inspected to determine whether they have been illegally converted. For purposes of this subsection, "illegally converted" means that the property was converted to another or additional use beyond that for which the property was originally permitted, and which [i] is in violation of the property's zoning limitations and [ii] is not a legal nonconforming use under section V of the City Zoning Ordinance. 
(d)  Proposed compliance inspection. When the owner files the notice of transfer, the department will schedule a proposed compliance inspection to be conducted within twenty-eight (28) calendar days of the notice. The notice of transfer form shall include the following: 
(1)  Date and time of the proposed compliance inspection; 
(2)  A statement that the owner or occupant has the right to withhold consent to the compliance inspection and require the city to obtain a warrant to conduct the inspection; 
(3)  For occupied rental dwellings, the city must also request and obtain the consent of the tenant prior to conducting any inspection; and 
(4)  A space for the owner and/or tenant to indicate that the owner and/or tenant either consent to the compliance inspection, or refuse consent. 
(e)  Refusal to consent; warrant procedures. If the owner or occupant does not consent to the proposed inspection, the director may appear before any judge in the Circuit Court of Cook County and seek an administrative search warrant to allow an inspection. Any such application shall be made within ten (10) calendar days after the owner's nonconsent. The application for the warrant shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is being sought and shall include a statement that the inspection will be limited to a determination whether there are violations of the code provisions identified in this section, and whether there have been any illegal conversions. The court may consider any of the following factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as to whether a warrant shall issue: 
(1)  Eyewitness account of violation; 
(2)  Citizen complaints; 
(3)  Tenant complaints; 
(4)  Plain view violations; 
(5)  Violations apparent from city records; 
(6)  Property deterioration; 
(7)  Age of property; 
(8)  Nature of alleged violation; 
(9)  Condition of similar properties in the area; 
(10)  Documented violations on similar properties in the area; 
(11)  Passage of time since last inspection; 
(12)  Previous violations on the property. 
(f)  Uninspected property; transfer stamps. In the event the owner or occupant refuses to consent to an inspection, and the director does not seek a warrant (or if court refuses an application for the warrant), the department shall notify the city clerk that "uninspected property" transfer stamps may issue. In connection with the issuance of transfer stamps, the city clerk shall advise the purchaser of such property that it is "uninspected property." 
(g)  Inspection procedures; appeal. 
(1)  In the event consent is given or a warrant issued, the department shall conduct the compliance inspection as provided in subsections (c) and (d). Within three business days after the compliance inspection the department shall issue a written notice of violations and repairs, if any, necessary to bring the property into compliance with this section. In the event the inspection reveals a structure which has been illegally converted, the department shall issue a notice of deconversion, specifying the measures which must be taken in order to bring the illegally converted structure into compliance with applicable zoning regulations. 
(2)  In the event the owner disputes the determination of violations and repairs, the owner may file a request for administrative review on a form provided by the city. An independent administrative hearing officer appointed by the city shall convene an administrative hearing within five (5) business days from the date of appeal. Upon completion of the administrative hearing, the hearing officer will issue a final determination of violation and repairs. 
(3)  In the event an owner disagrees with an administrative issuance of a notice of deconversion, said owner may appeal to the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section 12.5 of the city's zoning ordinance. 
(h)  Followup repairs; reinspection. A party issued a notice of repairs as provided for in subsection (g) shall proceed to make such repairs. Upon completion of said repairs and notice thereof to the department, the department will conduct a reinspection within three (3) business days thereafter. Upon completion of the followup repairs, and the completion of any deconversion measures required by the department, the department shall issue a certificate of compliance. 
(i)  Payment of current water bills; predeprivation hearing. The seller must pay the current water bill (as defined in subsection 82-327(b) of the Municipal Code) and other fees owed by the seller to Calumet City prior to the issuance of transfer stamps. In the event the owner disputes any such obligation (or any portion thereof), the office of city clerk shall promptly provide the owner with a predeprivation due process hearing consistent with the principles enunciated in Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division v Craft, 436 U.S. 1 (1978). The city clerk's office shall provide the hearing within three (3) business days of a request. If the owner disputes the city's determination as to liability, the owner may pay said bill under protest, and may pursue any remedies available to said seller to recover the claimed overcharge. 
(j)  Conditional certificate of compliance; procedures. An owner who has not completed the repairs identified through the inspection may nevertheless transfer ownership of property if: 
(1)  The owner or agent has deposited with the city an amount of money determined by the director or his designee to be sufficient to bring the structure into compliance with all city building and zoning ordinances and any applicable housing, fire or property maintenance codes or regulations; and 
(2)  The buyer, conveyee, transferee, assignee or successor in title, ownership or interest (hereinafter "buyer") has entered into an agreement with the city whereby the buyer agrees to bring the structure into compliance within the time period determined by the director or his designee, to bring the structure into compliance with all applicable code requirements within a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the closing of the transaction ("closing"). 
(3)  If the buyer enters into such an agreement, a conditional certificate of compliance will issue in order to allow the closing to be completed. The conditional certificate of compliance shall be issued by the department and shall terminate on the one hundred eighty-first day after closing and no extensions shall be granted. A buyer who elects to accept the premises, subject to the inspection with existing violations, and who agrees, in order to close, to be responsible as provided herein, shall execute a sworn affidavit satisfactory to the director, which will clearly indicate that the buyer is fully aware of the existing violations as well as the possibility of violations that may have existed but were undiscovered due to lack of access and agrees to accept the requirement and obligation to bring the structure into compliance within one hundred eighty (180) days of the closing. The city shall issue a certificate of compliance upon completion of the repairs necessary to bring the dwelling or structure into compliance. 
(4)  In the event the buyer fails to complete the required repairs, and have the repairs verified on reinspection, the director is hereby authorized to pursue enforcement proceedings through the Calumet City administrative adjudication process, or, at his discretion, through the Circuit Court of Cook County. The buyer hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the Calumet City Administrative Adjudication Process and the Circuit Court of Cook County and to waive service of summons subject only to the notice requirement as required by law in order to enable the city to expeditiously obtain an order of compliance with this section. 
(5)  If reasonable proof that the repairs have been completed is not received by the director or his designee within the required period for the repairs to be completed, the city may also issue a citation for violation of this chapter and/or the escrow repair agreement, and may also pursue any applicable administrative or judicial remedies to bring the structure and property into compliance with applicable codes and regulations. 
(6)  The fine for violations of this chapter shall be not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each day the violations remain uncorrected. 
(k)  Licensed and bonded contractors. All contractors performing repairs identified in the point-of-sale inspection, or issuing certifications shall be licensed by the city and bonded and shall make available, upon request, copies of their license(s), verification of their liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance policies, and surety bond. 
(l)  Validity of certificate of compliance. A certificate of compliance issued to the seller shall be valid for one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance. 
(m)  No warranty. In issuing a certificate of compliance or a conditional certificate of compliance, the city and its agents do not make any warranty, representation or statement nor does it intend to insure or guarantee to either buyer or seller of the property subject to the point-of-sale inspection or any of their designees, agents, representatives, heirs or assigns or any other interested party, including mortgage companies, insurance companies, banks or any other party which may have any interest relative to the property subject to the point-of-sale inspection, nor does the city affirm that there are no additional unnoted violations relative to any other provisions of any of the Municipal Code of the City of Calumet City, or relevant statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations of the County of Cook, the State of Illinois or the United States of America. 
(n)  Inspection fee schedule. 
(1)  The fee for a point-of-sale inspection shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for all single-family residential inspections. The failure of an owner/seller or his designee to appear at the time of inspection shall result in a fifty-dollar penalty. 
(2)  The fee for a point of sale inspection shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) plus an additional twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each residential unit in excess of one (1) unit. 
(3)  A fee of twenty cents ($0.20) per square foot shall be charged for each commercial/industrial unit inspected with a minimum fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per commercial/industrial unit. 
(4)  Each fee set for the above covers the cost of one (1) follow-up inspection to verify compliance. In the event that additional inspections are required because full compliance did not exist at the time of the reinspection, then an additional reinspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per unit shall be assessed. 
(5)  If an owner, agent or tenant has failed to appear for a scheduled inspection, an additional inspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per unit shall be assessed.

ARTICLE IV. - EQUITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM FOR SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCES 
 
Sec. 18-101. - Creation of program; purpose; name. 
There is hereby created an equity assurance program to be administered by the equity assurance commission of the city for the benefit of the citizens of the city. The purpose of the program is to insure the single-family residences in the city against the possibility of economic loss, and thereby help to eliminate irrational fears of racial change. The purpose of the program is not to insure against a regional or national decline in values in the single-family housing market. Therefore, in the event of a general economic decline in the value of single-family homes in the Chicago-Cook County-Metropolitan area single-family home market, the mayor and city council of the city reserve the right to review, revise and suspend payments under the equity assurance program. This program will provide greater community stability and will strengthen the tax base of the community by preserving and improving single-family home values.

(1)  The certified appraiser will determine the percentage depreciation of the insured residence due to the failure of the owner to maintain the premises. 
(2)  This percentage figure shall be multiplied by the appraised valuation to determine the dollar depreciation due to failure to maintain the premises. 
(3)  This dollar depreciation shall be subtracted from the appraised valuation to derive a lower appraised valuation to be used for the purpose of determining the amount of coverage afforded under this article. 
(f)  From ninety (90) through one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the insured residence is placed on the market, coverage shall be in effect as hereinafter set forth.

Within three (3) working days from receipt of the offer(s) for purchase, the EAC shall either: 
(1)  Approve the offer for purchase, whereupon the member must accept the offer and the EAC shall authorize the payment of the amount of coverage afforded by section 18-106 of this article subject to the following conditions:

a.  Offer to pay eighty (80) percent of the difference between the appraised value and the offering price if the member agrees to sell at the offered price. If the member does not agree to sell at the offered price, then in no event shall the member receive from the EAP any payment in excess of the EAP payment provided for in this subsection (h)(2)a. 
b.  Advise the member that the offer is inadequate and should be refused. If the member under these circumstances desires to accept the offer, then the property shall be acquired from the member by the EAP at the offered price plus eighty (80) percent of the difference between the offered price and the appraised value. If the member refuses the offer pursuant to this subsection (h)(2)b and the court determination of the value of the property is less than the appraised value, then the EAP shall pay eighty (80) percent of the difference between the judgment and the appraised value.

(Code 1980, § 8-6; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000; Ord. No. 08-57, § 2, 8-14-2008)  
Sec. 34-37. - Duties of the enforcement officials. 
The director of inspectional services shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this chapter which shall include the following: 
(1)  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the director shall review the application to determine the following: 
(a)  Whether the proposed improvements qualify as a level 1, 2 or 3 development; and 
(b)  Whether the site is within a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If the site is in the SFHA, the director must: 
1.  Compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation to determine if any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first floor insurance rate map without a permit as required by this article is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this article. 
2.  Maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(2)  Ensure that any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a watershed development permit; 
(3)  Ensure that all development in a floodway (or floodplain with no delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of this article; 
(4)  Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and inspect the floodplain on an annual basis and document the results of the inspection; 
(5)  Require and obtain copies of all necessary federal, state and local permits and ensure that development projects are constructed in accordance with those permits; 
(6)  Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings subject to this article are met and maintained a record of the as-built elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproofing certificate. Maintain permit files including: 
(a)  An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject to this article, and/or; 
(b)  The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to this article. 
(7)  Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as-built" elevation and floodproofing certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this article; 
(8)  Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this article; 
(9)  Submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program;

(11)  Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter. 
(12)  Submit data to IDNR and FEMA to support proposed revisions to the regulatory maps. 
(13)  Ensure that development projects authorized by state and federal authorities are constructed in accordance with the related state and federal permits. 
(14)  Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of this article. 
(15)  Use the criteria listed in this article, base flood elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. 
Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the director must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified, or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one (1) square mile. 
Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this article. 
If the site is within a flood fringe, the director shall require that the minimum requirements of this article be met. 
If the site is within a floodway, the director shall require that the minimum requirements of this article be met. 
If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the director shall require that the minimum requirements of section 34-94 be met. 
If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the director shall review the requirements of section 34-40 to make sure they are met. In addition, the director shall complete all notification requirements. 
(16)  In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this article, the Director may take any and all actions as outlined in section 34-39. 
(17)  Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one (1) square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer under the employ or contract of the city for review to ensure that the development meets sections 34-92 or 34-93. 
In the case of an appropriate use, the professional engineer shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section 34-93. 
(18)  State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections 34-92 or 34-93 and of this article. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the city and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR: 
(a)  Organizations which are exempt from this article, as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes; 
(b)  IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in section 34-34 and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the city and county, except for those projects meeting the requirements of section 34-93; 
(c)  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per section 34-93; 
(d)  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to section 34-93; 
(e)  Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in section 34-93; 
(f)  Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and streams; 
(g)  Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles. 
(19)  Cooperation with other agencies. 
(a)  Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this article; 
(b)  Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a regulatory map within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map; 
(c)  Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program; and 
(d)  Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this article. 
(20)  Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this article, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any article changes.

(5)  The release rate shall be the total of the following: 
a.  Four-hundredths (0.04) cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary drainage area (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by impoundment of the on-site two (2) year storm volume plus the detention volume safety factor; and 
b.  Fifteen-hundredths (0.15) cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary drainage area (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by impoundment of the on-site one hundred (100) year storm volume plus the detention volume safety factor; and 
c.  The required compensatory storage; and 
d.  The release rate and on-site detention volume shall be calculated using the twenty-four (24) hour storm event. This release rate calculation shall be used unless other site conditions warrant further analysis and modification from this standard or unless watershed-specific release rates have been adopted. 
(6)  On-stream detention shall provide water quality treatment. One (1) of the following two (2) methods shall be used: 
a.  A wet detention facility shall be constructed with a minimum permanent pool volume equal to the calculated sediment volume accumulated over a one (1) year period for the entire upstream watershed and an average normal water depth of at least four (4) feet. The facility shall also have a live storage volume that meets the standard storage requirements of this section. 
b.  A separate off-line sediment basin shall be used with a volume appropriate for the tributary drainage area to the sediment basin. 
(7)  Impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, and shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat. These fish species may be present or potentially present.

(Code 1980, § 8-10; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000)  
Sec. 34-64. - Erosion and sediment control. 
(a)  General principles. 
(1)  The requirements of this section shall only affect level 1 and 2 developments. 
(2)  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes, where high cut and fills may be required, should be avoided and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
(3)  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected. Clearing of natural ground cover and/or trees within a buffer area as defined in section 34-65 should be left undisturbed wherever possible. 
(4)  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one (1) time. 
(5)  Prior to site clearing and grading, sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions and other appropriate control measures shall be installed. 
(6)  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development. Native vegetation is preferred for developments near, or adjacent to high quality natural areas, wetlands and streams. 
(7)  Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development. 
(8)  All waste generated as a result of site development shall be properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water. 
(b)  On-site control measures. The on-site control measures shall be designed based on the size of the disturbed areas as follows: 
(1)  For disturbed areas draining less than one (1) acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet may be used as an alternative where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
(2)  For disturbed areas draining more than one (1) acre but less than five (5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area in conjunction with other filter barriers. 
(3)  For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area in conjunction with other filter barriers. 
(4)  Sediment basin and trap design shall provide for both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be for equal volumes of wet detention storage and dry detention storage. Each shall be sized for the two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour runoff from the site. The release rate shall be that rate required to achieve a minimum detention time of ten (10) hours. The outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
(5)  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one (1) year. A sediment removal schedule is required for construction periods exceeding one (1) year. 
(c)  Stormwater conveyance channels. Stormwater conveyance channels, ditches, swales, and diversions, shall convey a ten (10) year frequency storm without erosion. All channels shall be stabilized within forty-eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards: 
(1)  For grades up to four (4) percent, seeding in combination with mulch or erosion blankets shall be placed along the channel sides with sod or erosion blanket applied to the bottom; 
(2)  For grades of four (4) to eight (8) percent, sod shall be used; and 
(3)  For grades greater than eight (8) percent, use rock or rip-rap, or reduce the grade using drop structures. 
(d)  Channel protection. 
(1)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty-five (25) feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels. 
(2)  Land disturbance activities in stream channels and construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. 
(3)  Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive materials such as rip-rap or gravel. 
(4)  The temporary stream crossing shall be completely removed and the stream restored to its preconstruction condition within forty-eight (48) hours after completion of construction, incorporating appropriate native vegetation. Also see section 34-92 requirements in floodways. 
(e)  Additional requirements. 
(1)  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
(2)  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent. 
(3)  Each site shall have graveled entrance roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
(f)  References adopted. 
(1)  Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in accordance with the "Illinois Urban Manual" (1995) or latest edition. 
(2)  Sediment and erosion control planning shall be in accordance with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (revised July, 1988) by the Urban Committee of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts (the "Green Book") Chapters 15. 
(3)  Where the requirements of sections 34-63(b)(e) of this chapter, the Illinois Urban Manual or the "Green Book" conflict, the more restrictive requirement shall prevail. 
(g)  Plan requirements. An erosion and sediment control plan shall include the following: 
(1)  Proposed sequencing schedule, including dates, for: 
a.  Stripping; 
b.  Installation of temporary on-site control measures and perimeter controls;

d.  Construction; 
e.  Installation of storm drainage and paving; and 
f.  Final grading, removal of temporary measures and landscaping. 
(2)  Location, standard details and design specifics of sediment basins and traps. The design specifics should include outlet details and the drainage area to each measure. 
(3)  Location and description of all control measures, including seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, kind and quantity of mulching for both temporary and permanent vegetative control measures and types of nonvegetative stabilization measures. 
(4)  Description of dust and traffic control measures and location and specifications for construction entrances. 
(5)  Locations of stockpiles and description of stabilization measures. 
(6)  Volumes, locations and methods of stabilization for off-site fill or borrow. 
(7)  Provisions for maintenance of control measures, including a maintenance schedule. 
(8)  Description of permanent stabilization measures including identification (name, address and telephone) of the person(s) or entity responsible for maintenance during and after construction. 
(h)  Extended construction shutdown period. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active disturbance or redisturbance. The condition of the construction site for the winter shut-down period shall address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season. Stabilization measures include seeding, mulching, sodding or erosion control blankets. 
(i)  Final site stabilization. All temporary control measures shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after permanent soil stabilization measures have been installed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
(Code 1980, § 8-11; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000)  
Sec. 34-65. - Stream and wetland protection. 
(a)  Buffer areas required. Buffer areas shall be required along all streams, lakes, waterways, channels and wetlands, except for the following:

(2)  Existing excavated stormwater storage facilities; 
(3)  Borrow pits and quarries; 
(4)  Leveed waterways; and 
(5)  Improvements to existing public roads and utilities. 
(b)  Buffer area dimensions. 
(1)  Linear buffers. Linear buffers shall be designated along both sides of all streams and natural channels. A minimum buffer of thirty (30) feet on each side of the channel shall be provided. 
(2)  Water body buffers. Water body buffers shall encompass all lakes, wetlands and other nonlinear bodies of water. A minimum buffer of thirty (30) feet on each side of the channel shall be provided. 
(3)  Exceptional functional value wetlands shall have a minimum buffer of one hundred (100) feet. 
(4)  In areas having state or federal threatened and endangered species present or for Illinois Natural Area Inventory Sites, buffer widths may be modified to meet the terms and conditions specified during consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources or United States Fish and Wildlife Service, pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations. 
(5)  The buffer area for all waters of the United States shall extend from the ordinary highwater mark. The buffer area for wetlands shall extend from the edge of the delineated wetland. A property may contain a buffer area that originates from the waters of the United States on another property. 
(6)  Buffer averaging may be allowed by the director of inspectional services, provided the buffer width is at least one-half (½) of the buffer width required by this chapter the minimum width required by a corps of engineers permit, whichever is wider. 
(c)  Buffer requirements. 
(1)  Features of the stormwater management system may be within the buffer area of a development. 
(2)  Access through buffer areas shall be provided, when necessary, for maintenance purposes. 
(3)  Preservation of buffer areas shall be provided by deed or plat restriction. 
(d)  Allowed uses in buffer areas. 
(1)  All buffer areas shall be maintained free from development except for the following uses: 
a.  Passive recreation, including pedestrian, bicycle or equestrian trails. 
b.  Construction and maintenance of utilities and stormwater facilities. 
(2)  Structures and impervious surfaces related to recreational facilities, such as trails and paths, may occupy a maximum of twenty (20) percent of the buffer surface area, provided the runoff from such facilities is diverted away from the waters of the United States or such runoff is directed to enter the buffer area as unconcentrated flow. Boat docks, boat houses and piers shall be allowed and count as a structure when calculating percent of impervious area. 
(3)  Buffer areas hydrologically disturbed by allowing construction or as part of a revegetation plan shall be revegetated using the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois, (NRCS, et al.) as a minimum standard. 
(e)  Channel protection. 
(1)  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, the permit applicant shall demonstrate that 
a.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity, which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing or existing structures, removal or structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. 
b.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
(2)  A channel modification shall be designed and constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
b.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
c.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one (1) side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
d.  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
e.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
f.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
g.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
h.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
i.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
j.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
k.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification. 
l.  The provisions of sections 34-63(d) and 34-63(e) shall also be met. 
(f)  Dumping. 
(1)  No person, firm, corporation or governmental agency shall dispose of or dump grass clippings, brush, fill, trash, debris, or other material that may obstruct the flow or storage of water in any channel, swale, culvert, storm sewer, wetland, storage basin or other natural or manmade watercourse or water body. 
(2)  No person, firm, corporation or governmental agency shall dispose of or dump any petroleum products, chemicals, noxious liquids, animal waste or other materials that will pollute the water in any channel, swale, culvert, storm sewer, wetland, storage basin or other natural or manmade watercourse or water body. 
(Code 1980, § 8-12; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000; Ord. No. 08-57, § 2, 8-14-2008)

Sec. 34-91. - Regulatory floodplain data. 
(a)  Special flood hazard area. 
(1)  All development within the special flood hazard area is subject to this chapter. 
(2)  The special flood hazard area (SFHA) is the area subject to flooding by the base flood and shown on the August 19, 2008, Cook County countywide flood insurance rate map as zone 5A, A1-30, AE, A0, and/or AH. 
(b)  Base flood elevation. 
(1)  The base flood elevation or 100-year frequency elevation for the SFHAs of the Little Calumet Rivers shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Cook County county-wide flood insurance study prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study as may be prepared from time to time. 
(2)  The base flood elevation or 100-year frequency elevation for each SFHA delineated as zone AH or zone AO shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the August 19, 2008, Cook County countywide flood insurance rate map. 
(3)  The base flood elevation or 100-year frequency elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. 
a.  When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. 
b.  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. 
c.  For a non-riverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three (3) feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. 
d.  For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one (1) square mile) that has been identified by the director of inspectional services or the city engineer, pursuant to section 34-37 the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved pursuant to this section herein. 
(4)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(5)  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. 
(c)  SFHAs defined by elevation. Upon receipt of a development permit application, the director of inspectional services shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation and which has not been filled since the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map as required by this chapter, is not in the SFHA and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Flood protection elevation (FPE). The flood protection elevation, or FPE, shall be the elevation of the base flood plus one (1) foot at any given location in the SFHA. 
(e)  Designated floodway. 
(1)  The floodways are designated for on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. When two (2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail. 
(2)  The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed into the city are designated for the Little Calumet River on the countywide flood insurance rate map prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. 
To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation. 
(f)  Challenges to regulatory floodplain data. When a party disagrees with the regulatory floodplain data proscribed by this chapter, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA.

1.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
2.  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. 
3.  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 34-34 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
A.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
B.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
C.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
D.  A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
E.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 34-93. 
g.  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. 
1.  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten (10) feet from the outside of the building. 
2.  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.

d.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection 34-93(g)(13)). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
e.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
(9)  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(10)  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
a.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in this article, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.

1.  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and 
2.  Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations; and 
3.  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(11)  Conditional letter of map revision. 
a.  If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
b.  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
c.  In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
d.  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
e.  After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
(12)  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer. 
(13)  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty-five (25) feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:

b.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
(14)  After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans. 
(Code 1980, § 8-15; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000; Ord. No. 08-57, § 2, 8-14-2008)  
Sec. 34-94. - Areas without regulatory floodplain data. 
(a)  Jurisdiction. In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and unnumbered A Zones) where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
No development in the SFHA where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging of potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or thereat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. 
(b)  Base flood elevations. The base flood elevation shall be the best data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository. If the state water survey does not have data sufficient for regulatory purposes, the following procedures shall be used to obtain the base flood elevation for a site: 
(1)  If the base flood elevation is needed for a level 2 or 3 development in a riverine SFHA, then the base flood elevation shall be determined using the "Quick-2 Computer Program" or similar method described in Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas, FEMA publication 265, and accepted by the state water survey. 
(2)  If the base flood elevation is needed for a level 1 development project within a riverine SFHA, then: 
a.  The base flood elevation shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. 
b.  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model that meets the requirements of section 7.9 design methods. 
c.  Along any watercourses draining more than one (1) square mile, the analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval. Once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. 
(3)  For a nonriverine SFHA: 
a.  The base flood elevation shall be the highest historic flood recorded plus three (3) feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. 
b.  In drainage areas greater than one (1) square mile, the calculations shall be approved by IDNR/OWR. 
(c)  Designated floodway. An applicant for a permit in an SFHA without a designated floodway may: 
(1)  Treat the entire SFHA as the designated floodway. 
(2)  Have an engineering study performed by a licensed professional engineer to determine a regulatory floodway. The regulatory floodway may be submitted to IDNR/OWR for inclusion on IDNR/OWR's designated floodway list. 
(3)  If the application is for a level 2 or 3 development project, treat the ninety (90) percent of the floodplain closest to the channel as the regulatory floodway and the ten (10) percent of the floodplain farthest from the channel as fringe. 
(d)  Level 1 developments. Proposals for new level 1 developments: 
(1)  Shall include base flood elevation data and floodway delineations. The applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the needed data. 
(2)  The applicant's engineer shall submit the data to IDNR/OWR for review and approval as best available regulatory data and then send it to the state water survey. 
(Code 1980, § 8-16; Ord. No. 00-65, § 1, 10-12-2000; Ord. No. 08-57, § 2, 8-14-2008)  
Sec. 34-95. - Dam requirements. 
Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard) and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. 
Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that have an embankment are non-jurisdictional Class III dam. It is not required that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all non-jurisdictional Class III dams. 
A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required. 
A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. 
Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. 
(Ord. No. 08-57, § 2, 8-14-2008)  
Sec. 34-96. - Occupation and use in flood fringe areas. 
(a)  [Protection against flood.] Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this article. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of section 34-92. 
(b)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
(1)  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
(c)  Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The director shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsection. 
(1)  Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection 34-92(d). 
(2)  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE). 
(3)  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten (10) feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the director may waive the ten (10) foot minimum setback if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the director for review. The director may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four (4) feet. 
(4)  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty (20) feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the Director may waive the twenty (20) foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the city for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four (4) feet. 
(5)  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five (5) feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes. 
(6)  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one (1) material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
(7)  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
(8)  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five (5) below the BFE. 
(9)  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-quarter (¼) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
(10)  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
(11)  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
(12)  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the director may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer. 
(13)  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed eighteen (18) inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

A towing adjudicator, appointed by the mayor or the chief of the police department, shall conduct such preliminary hearing within forty-eight (48) hours of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, unless the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to section 62-10 and the police department determines that it must retain custody of the vehicle under applicable state or federal forfeiture law or if the vehicle is being held pending an investigation. If, after the preliminary hearing, the towing adjudicator determines that there is probable cause to show that the vehicle was used in violation of this Code, the towing adjudicator shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle unless the owner of the vehicle pays to the city the amount of the administrative penalty, plus fees for towing and storing the vehicle, and any other fees deemed applicable. If the vehicle is also subject to immobilization for unpaid final determinations of parking and/or compliance violations, the owner of the vehicle must also pay the amounts due for all such outstanding violations prior to the release of the vehicle. If the towing adjudicator determines that there is no such probable cause the vehicle shall be returned without penalty or other fees. 
(2)  Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded, the police department shall notify, by personal service or certified mail, the owner of record and any lien holder of record of the owner's right to request a hearing before an administrative hearing officer, as appointed by section 2-943, on the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle. The notice shall state the penalties which may be imposed if no hearing is requested or where penalty and fees assessed remain unpaid, include the city's right to sell such vehicle and apply all proceeds from the sale thereof to the payment of all penalties and fees due and owing. The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the city police department no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice was mailed. The hearing date must be no more than thirty (30) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after a request for a hearing has been filed. If, after the hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of this Code the administrative hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record liable to the city for the amount of the administrative penalty, plus towing and storage fees, and any other applicable fees. If, after a hearing, the administrative hearing officer does not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such a violation, the administrative hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return of the vehicle or previously paid penalty and fees; provided that if the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to an investigation the vehicle shall not be returned unless and until permitted by investigating division; and provided that the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to section 62-10, the vehicle shall not be returned unless and until the city receives notice from the appropriate state, or where applicable, federal officials that (i) forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or (ii) forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a settlement or a court order providing that the vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record. 
(3)  If the owner of record requests a full hearing before an administrative hearing officer but fails to appear at the hearing; fails to request a hearing in a timely manner; or signs a waiver to the right to an administrative hearing, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and an administrative hearing officer of the city shall enter a default order in favor of the city in the amount of the administrative penalty prescribed hereinafter for the violation, plus towing and storage fees, and any applicable fees. 
(4)  When a vehicle violates this section the administrative penalty, plus towing and storage fees, and any applicable fees shall constitute a debt due and owing to the city. Any such fine, other sanction or costs imposed by an administrative hearing officer's order that remain unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures shall be a debt due and owing the city and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. After the expiration of the period in which judicial review may be sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of an administrative hearing officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the respondent in the amount of a debt due and owing the city. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from enforcing or seeking to enforce any order of an administrative hearing officer in any manner which is in accordance with applicable law. Any amounts paid pursuant to this section shall be applied to the penalty. 
(5)  Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until (1) the administrative penalty, plus any applicable fees including towing and storage fees are paid to the city, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle; or (2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a person with a lien of record against a vehicle impounded under this section has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she pays the applicable fees including towing and storage fees and agrees in writing to refund to the city the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien holders of record, up to the total amount of penalties imposed under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no vehicle that was seized and impounded pursuant to an investigation be returned unless and until permitted by investigating division. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no vehicle that was seized and impounded pursuant section 62-10 shall be returned to the record owner unless and until the city has received notice from the appropriate state, or where applicable, federal officials that (i) forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or (ii) forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a settlement or a court order providing that the vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record. 
(6)  Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within ten (10) days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial review of the city's action under this section; or, if judicial review is sought, the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the city; or the time a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in default may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law; provided that, if the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to Sec. 62-10 and proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the vehicle may not be disposed of by the city except as consistent with those proceedings. 
(7)  As used in this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle means the record titleholder. 
(8)  In a hearing on the propriety of impoundment under said section 62-9, any sworn or affirmed report, including a report prepared in compliance with Section 11-501.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, that (a) is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement officer's duties and (b) sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to the impoundment, shall be admissible evidence of the vehicle owner's liability under section 62-9 of this Code, and shall support a finding of the vehicle owner's liability under section 62-9, unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 
(9)  For purposes of this section, a vehicle is not considered to have been used in a violation that would render the vehicle eligible for towing if: (1) the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered; (2) the vehicle was operating as a common carrier and the violation occurred without the knowledge of the person in control of the vehicle; or (3) the alleged owner provides adequate proof that the vehicle had been sold to another person prior to the violation.

(b)  Whenever a police officer observes one (1) or more persons engaged in narcotics-related loitering in any public place designated for the enforcement of this section under subsection (c), the police officer shall: 
(1)  Inform all such persons that they are engaged in loitering within an area in which such loitering is prohibited; 
(2)  Order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from within sight and hearing of the place at which the order was issued; and

(c)  The police chief shall by written directive designate areas of the city in which enforcement of this section is necessary because the areas are frequently associated with narcotics-related loitering. Prior to making a determination under this subsection, the police chief shall consult, as he or she deems appropriate, with persons who are knowledgeable about the effects of narcotics-related activity in areas in which this section may be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be limited to, members of the department of police with special training or experience related to narcotics-related activity; other personnel of that department with particular knowledge of narcotics-related activities in the proposed designated area; elected and appointed officials of the area; community-based organizations; and others identified by the department who are familiar with the area. The police chief shall develop and implement procedures for the periodic review and update of designations made under this subsection. 
(d)  Any person who fails to obey promptly an order issued under subsection (b), or who engages in further narcotics-related loitering within sight or hearing of the place at which such an order was issued during the eight-hour period following the time the order was issued, shall be guilty of a violation punishable as follows: 
(1)  A fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense or the performance of up to sixty (60) hours of community service for each offense, or both; or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months for each offense; 
(2)  A second or subsequent offense shall be punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and not more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for each offense or a mandatory minimum performance of forty (40) hours of community service but not more than one hundred twenty (120) hours of community service for each offense, or both; or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months for each offense; 
(3)  Upon a third or subsequent conviction for a violation of this subsection or section 62-221, or any combination thereof, within any 12-month period, a court, in addition to imposing the penalties prescribed in this subsection, shall enter an order requiring the convicted person to refrain, for a mandatory period of thirty (30) days, from narcotics-related loitering as herein defined, or gang loitering as defined in section 62-221, within sight and hearing of the place of the police officer's order issued under this section or section 62-221, which served as the basis for the person's most recent conviction, unless circumstances strongly mandate that such period should be shorter. Such an order must be obeyed regardless of whether any additional warning or notice is given to the person. Any person who violates an order issued by a court under this subsection or section 62-221 shall be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than five (5) days' imprisonment but not more than six (6) months' imprisonment for each violation or a mandatory minimum performance of sixty (60) hours of community service but not more than one hundred twenty (120) hours of community service for each violation, plus a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and not more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00), for each violation.

Whenever possible, the tax imposed by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the selling price of the tangible personal property. The department may adopt and promulgate reasonable rules and regulations for the adding of such tax by retailers to selling prices by prescribing bracket systems for the purpose of enabling such retailers to add and collect, as far as practicable, the amount of such tax. The tax hereby imposed and not paid to a retailer pursuant to this section shall be paid to the department directly by any person purchasing or using such property within the city, pursuant to section 82-378 hereof. If any seller collects an amount (however designated) which purports to constitute taxes measured by receipts which are not subject to such tax, or if any seller, in collecting an amount (however designated) which purports to constitute taxes measured by receipts which are subject to tax under this article, collects more from the purchaser than the actual tax liability on the transaction, the purchaser shall have a legal right to claim a refund of such amount from such seller. However, if such amount is not refunded to the purchaser for any reason, the seller is liable to pay such amount to the department. This subsection does not apply to an amount collected by the seller on receipts which are subject to tax under this article as long as such collection is made in compliance with the tax collection brackets prescribed by the department in its rules and regulations.

(Code 1980, § 26-114; Ord. No. 81-35, § 1, 11-24-1981; Ord. No. 84-32, § 1, 8-30-1984)  
Sec. 82-375. - Certificate of registration required; who is a "retailer" for purposes of this article; application and bond, etc. 
(a)  Certificate defined. Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the city shall obtain a certificate of registration as a tax collector from the department no later than thirty (30) days after commencing such business or thirty (30) days after the effective date of this article, whichever occurs later. 
(b)  What constitutes a "retailer." 
(1)  The isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal property at retail by a person who does not hold himself out as being engaged (or who does not habitually engage) in selling such tangible personal property at retail, or a sale through a bulk vending machine, does not constitute such person a retailer within the meaning of this article; provided that any person who is engaged in a business which is not subject to the tax collection obligation imposed by this article because of involving the sale of or a contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such business, transfers tangible personal property to users of consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and which does not become real estate, under any provision of a construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales agreement entered into which some other person arising out of or because of such business which is not subject to such collection obligation, is a retailer to the extent of the value of the tangible personal property so transferred. If, in such a transaction, a separate charge is made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the value of such property, for the purpose of this article, shall be the amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of such property to the transferrer if no separate charge is made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this article, is the cost to the transferrer of such tangible personal property. 
(2)  A person who holds himself out as being engaged (or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to such sales notwithstanding the fact that such person is a serviceman engaging in sales of services. 
(3)  Persons who engage in the business of transferring tangible personal property upon the redemption of trading stamps are retailers hereunder and shall collect and pay the tax imposed by the article on the basis of the retail value of the property transferred upon redemption of such stamps. 
(4)  A person whose activities are organized and conducted primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who engages in selling tangible personal property at retail (whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting only a person organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes either: 
a.  To the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, patients or inmates of tangible personal property to be used primarily for the purposes of such person; or 
b.  To the extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for profit. 
The selling of school books and school supplies by schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the purposes of" the school which does such selling. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to nor subject to taxation; occasional dinners, socials or similar activities of a person organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes, whether or not such activities are open to the public. 
(5)  A person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 92-258) and serves meals to participants in the Federal Nutrition Program for the Elderly in return for contributions established in amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of suggested fees as provided for in the federal act is not a retailer hereunder with respect to such transactions. 
(6)  A person who is engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles to others and who, in connection with such business, sells any used motor vehicle to a purchaser for his use and not for the purpose of resale, is a retailer engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail under this article to the extent of the value of the vehicle sold. For the purpose of this section, "motor vehicle" has the meaning prescribed in Section 1-157 of The Illinois Vehicle Code, as now or hereafter amended. (Nothing provided herein shall affect liability incurred under this article because of the sale at retail of such motor vehicle to a lessor.) 
(c)  Application for certificate. Application for a certificate of registration shall be made to the department upon forms furnished by it. Each such application shall be signed and verified by the applicant or a properly accredited agent, which in the case of a corporation shall include the president, any vice president, the secretary or treasurer or some other properly accredited agent and shall state: 
(1)  The name of the applicant; 
(2)  His residence address and the address of his principal place of business; 
(3)  The address of the principal place of business from which he engages in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail in the city and the addresses of all other places of business, if any (enumerating such addresses, if any, in a separate list attached to and made a part of the application), from which he engages in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail in the city; 
(4)  The applicant's most recent gross receipts from the retail sale of tangible personal property whether or not incidental to the sale of service as reported to the state department of revenue; 
(5)  The applicant's estimated receipts from sales of tangible personal property at retail in the city for the current calendar year; and 
(6)  Such other information as the department may reasonably require. 
If the applicant will sell tangible personal property at retail through vending machines, his application to register shall indicate the number of vending machines to be so operated; and thereafter, he shall notify the department by January thirty-first of the number of vending machines which such person was using in his business of selling tangible personal property at retail on the preceding December 31. 
(d)  Bond. Every applicant for a certificate of registration hereunder shall, within thirty (30) days after he commences to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, furnish a bond from a surety company authorized to do business in the state, or a bond signed by two (2) personal sureties who have filed with the department sworn statements disclosing net assets equal to at least three (3) times the amount of the bond to be required of such applicant, or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or certificate of deposit, stocks or bonds, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the city all moneys becoming due under this article. The department shall fix the amount of such security in each case, taking into consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The amount of security required by the department shall be such as, in its opinion, will protect the city against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this chapter, but the amount of the security required by the department shall not exceed three (3) times the amount of the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remission liability, or fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), whichever amount is lower. No certificate of registration under this article shall be issued by the department until the applicant provides the department with satisfactory security as herein provided for. The department may waive the furnishing of a bond until January 1, 1982. 
(e)  Issuance of certificate. Upon receipt of the application for a certificate of registration in proper form, and upon approval by the department of the security furnished by the applicant, the department shall issue to such applicant a certificate of registration. 
(f)  Subcertificates. 
(1)  If the person so registered states that he operates other places of business as a retailer in the city, the department shall furnish him with a subcertificate of registration for each such place of business. All subcertificates of registration shall bear the same registration number as that appearing upon the certificate of registration to which such subcertificates relate. 
(2)  Where the same person engages in two (2) or more businesses as a retailer in the city, which businesses are substantially different in character or engaged in under different trade names or engaged in under other substantially dissimilar circumstances (so that it is more practicable, from an accounting, auditing or bookkeeping standpoint, for such business to be separately registered), the department may require or permit such person (subject to the same requirements concerning the furnishing of security as those that are provided for hereinbefore in this section as to each application for a certificate of registration) to apply for and obtain a separate certificate of registration for each such business or for any of such businesses, under a single certificate of registration supplemented by related subcertificates of registration. 
(g)  Types of security. With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the department may sue in the event of a forfeiture), if the tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security guarantees, the department shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the department through the issuance of a final assessment that has become final under the law, convert the security which that tax collector has furnished into money for the city after first giving the tax collector at least ten (10) days' written notice, by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or forfeit such security to the department. If the security consists of stocks or bonds or other securities which are listed on a public exchange, the department shall sell such securities through such public exchange. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the department shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank certificate of deposit from the bank which issued such certificate. If the security consists of a type of stocks or other securities which are not listed on a public exchange, the department shall sell such security to the highest and best bidder after giving at least ten (10) days' notice of the date, time and place of the intended sale by publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city. If the department realizes more than the amount of such liability from the security, plus the expenses incurred by the department in converting the security into money, the department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such security and the balance shall be paid into the corporate fund of the city. 
(h)  Receipts. Except as to motor vehicles and other items of tangible personal property which must be titled or registered under state law, but which cannot be so titled or registered without a use tax receipt or exemption determination from the state department of revenue, every retailer maintaining a place of business in the city and making sales of tangible personal property for use in the city shall, when collecting the tax as provided in section 82-374 of this article from the purchaser, give to the purchaser (if demanded by the purchaser) a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the department. Such receipt shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which such receipt may refer. Each such retailer shall list with the department the names and addresses of all his agents operating in the city and the location of any and all of his distribution or sales houses, offices of other places of business in the city. 
(Code 1980, § 26-115; Ord. No. 81-35, § 1, 11-24-1981)  
Sec. 82-376. - Procedures for filing returns. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, every retailer required or authorized to collect the tax imposed by this article shall, on or before the last day of each calendar month, file a return for the preceding calendar month with the department, stating: 
(1)  The name of the retailer; 
(2)  His residence address and the address of his principal place of business and the address of the principal place of business (if that is a different address) from which he engages in the business of selling tangible personal property in the city; 
(3)  Total amount of receipts received by him during the preceding calendar month from sales of tangible personal property in the city by him during such preceding calendar month; 
(4)  Total amount received by him during the preceding calendar month on charge and time sales of tangible personal property in the city by him prior to the month for which the return is filed; 
(5)  Deductions allowed by law; 
(6)  Receipts which were received by him during the preceding calendar month and upon the basis of which the tax upon purchasers from him is imposed; 
(7)  The amount of tax due; 
(8)  The amount of penalty due, if any; and 
(9)  Such other reasonable information as the department may require. 
(b)  If the retailer's average monthly liability to the department does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the department may authorize his returns to be filed on a quarter annual basis, with the return for January, February and March of a given year being due by April 30 of such year; with the return for April, May and June of a given year being due by July 31 of such year; with the return for July, August and September of a given year being due by October 31 of such year, and with the return for October, November and December of a given year being due by January 31 of the following year. 
(c)  If the retailer's average monthly liability with the department does not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), the department may authorize his returns to be filed on an annual basis, with the return for a given year being due by January 31 of the following year. 
(d)  Such quarter annual and annual returns, as to form and substance shall be subject to the same requirements as monthly returns. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this article concerning the time within which a retailer may file his return, in the case of any retailer who ceases to engage in a kind of business which makes him responsible for filing returns under this article, such retailer shall file a final return under this article with the department not more than one (1) month after discontinuing such business. 
(f)  Where the same person has more than one (1) business registered with the department under separate registrations under this chapter, such person may not file each return that is due as a single return covering all such registered businesses, but shall file separate returns for each such registered business. 
(g)  Refunds to purchasers made by the retailer during the preceding return period shall be allowed as a deduction under subdivision 5, in case the retailer had theretofore included the receipts from such sale in a return filed by him and has remitted the tax imposed by this article with respect to such receipts. 
(h)  Where the retailer is a corporation, the return filed on behalf of such corporation shall be signed by the president, vice-president, secretary or treasurer by the properly accredited agent of such corporation or by the chief executive officer or highest ranking manager. 
(i)  Except as provided in this section, the retailer filing the return under this section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay to the department the amount of tax imposed by this article less a discount of two (2) percent or five dollars ($5.00) per calendar year, whichever is greater, which is allowed to reimburse the seller for the expenses incurred in collecting the tax, keeping records, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the department on request. 
(j)  All such deposits shall be credited against the tax collector's liabilities under this article. 
(k)  If the tax collector's average monthly liability to the department under this article was twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or more during the preceding four (4) complete calendar quarters, he shall file a return with the department each month by the end of the month next following the month during which such liability is incurred and shall make payments to the department on or before the seventh, fifteenth, twenty-second and last day of the month during which such liability is incurred in an amount equal to one-fourth (¼) of the tax collector's actual liability for the month or an amount set by the department not to exceed one-fourth (¼) of the average monthly liability of the tax collector to the department for the preceding four (4) complete calendar quarters (excluding the month of highest liability and the month of lowest liability in such four-quarter period). The amount of such quarter monthly payments shall be credited against the final tax liability on the tax collector's return for that month. Once applicable, the requirement of the making of quarter monthly payments to the department shall continue until such tax collector's average monthly liability to the department during the preceding four (4) complete calendar quarters (excluding the month of highest liability and the month of lowest liability) is less than nine thousand dollars ($9,000.00), or until such tax collector's average monthly liability to the department as computed for each calendar quarter of the four (4) preceding complete calendar quarter period is less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). (If any such quarter monthly payment is not paid at the time or in the amount required by this section, then the two (2) percent tax collector's discount shall be reduced by two (2) percent of the difference between the minimum amount due as a payment and the amount of such quarter monthly payment actually and timely paid, except insofar as the tax collector has previously made payments for that month to the department in excess of the minimum payments previously due as provided in this section. The department shall make reasonable rules and regulations to govern the quarter monthly payment amount and quarter monthly payment dates for tax collectors who file on other than a calendar monthly basis). 
(l)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, for the first twelve (12) month period this tax is in effect the department may estimate what the amount of liability from any tax collector would have been for prior periods if the tax hereunder had been in effect for such periods and direct the frequency of remittance of the tax and filing of returns in accordance with the provisions of this section on the basis of such estimates. 
(m)  If any such payment or deposit provided for in this section exceeds the tax collector's present and probable future liabilities under this article, the department shall issue to the taxpayer no later than sixty (60) days after the date of payment a credit memorandum, which may be submitted by the tax collector to the department in payment of liability subsequently to be remitted by the tax collector to the department or be assigned by the tax collector to a similar tax collector under this article, in accordance with reasonable rules and regulations to be prescribed by the department. 
(n)  Any deposit previously made by a tax collector who is required to make quarter monthly payments under this article shall be applied against the tax collector's liability to the department under this article for the month preceding the first month in which the tax collector is required to make such quarter monthly payments. If the deposit exceeds that liability, the department may issue the tax collector a credit memorandum for the excess. 
(o)  The money received by the department under the provisions of this article shall be deposited in the corporate fund of the city. 
(p)  The department may require the tax collector to prepare and file with the department on a form prescribed by the department within fifteen (15) days after filing the state income tax return for his fiscal year an annual information return for such fiscal year. Such annual return to the department shall include a statement of receipts as shown by the retailer's last state income tax return. If the total receipts of the business as reported in the state income tax return do not agree with the receipts reported to the department for the same period, the retailer shall attach to his annual return a schedule showing a reconciliation of the two (2) amounts and the reasons for the difference. The retailer's annual return to the department shall also disclose any additional reasonable information which the department deems would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the quarter-monthly, monthly, quarterly or annual returns filed by such seller as provided for in this section. The provisions of this section concerning the filing of an annual information return do not apply to a retailer who is not required to file an income tax return with the United States government. 
(q)  If the annual information return required by this section is not filed when and as required, the tax collector shall be liable for a penalty equal to one-sixth ( 1/6 ) of one (1) percent of the amount due from such tax collector under this article during the period to be covered by the annual return for each month or fraction of a month until such return is filed as required, the penalty to be assessed and collected in the same manner as any other penalty provided for in this article. 
(r)  The president, vice-president, secretary or treasurer, chief executive officer, proprietor, owner or highest ranking manager shall sign any return required to be filed under this section to certify the accuracy of the information contained therein. Any person who willfully signs any such return containing false or inaccurate information shall be guilty of a violation of this article and punished accordingly. The return forms prescribed by the department shall include a warning that the person signing such return may be liable for a penalty as provided by this article. 
(s)  Any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail as a concessionaire or other type of seller at art shows, flea markets and similar exhibitions or events may be required to make a daily report of the amount of such sales to the department and to make a daily payment of the full amount of tax due. The department shall impose this requirement when it finds that there is a significant risk of loss of revenue to the city at such an exhibition or event. Such a finding shall be based on evidence that a substantial number of concessionaires or other sellers who are not residents of the city will be engaging in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail at the exhibition or event, or other evidence of a significant risk of loss of revenue to the city. The department shall notify concessionaires and other sellers affected by the imposition of this requirement. In the absence of notification by the department, the concessionaires and other sellers shall file their returns as otherwise required in this section. 
(t)  With respect to motor vehicles and aircraft, every retailer selling this kind of tangible personal property shall file, with the department, upon a form to be prescribed and supplied by the department, a separate return for each such item of tangible personal property which the retailer sells, except that where, in the same transaction, a retailer of motor vehicles transfers more than one (1) motor vehicle to another motor vehicle retailer for the purpose of resale, such seller for resale may report the transfer of all the motor vehicles involved in that transaction to the department on the same uniform invoice-transaction reporting return form. Such transaction reporting return in the case of motor vehicles shall be the same document as the uniform invoice referred to in Section 5-402 of The Illinois Vehicle Code and must show the name and address of the seller; the name and address of the purchaser; the amount of the selling price, including the amount allowed by the retailer for traded-in property; if any; the amount allowed by the retailer for the traded-in tangible personal property, if any, to the extent to which section 82-372 of this article allows an exemption for the value of traded-in property; the balance payable after deducting such trade-in allowance from the total selling price; the amount of tax due from the retailer with respect to such transaction; the amount of tax collected from the purchaser by the retailer on such transaction (or satisfactory evidence that such tax is not due in that particular instance, if that is claimed to be the fact); the place and date of the sale; a sufficient identification of the property sold; such other information as is required in Section 5-402 of The Illinois Vehicle Code, and such other information as the department may reasonably require. Such transaction reporting return in the case of aircraft must show the name and address of the retailer; the name and address of the purchaser; the amount of the selling price including the amount allowed by the retailer for traded-in property, if any; the amount allowed by the retailer for the traded-in tangible personal property, if any, to the extent to which section 82-372 of this article allowed an exemption for the traded-in property; the balance payable after deducting such trade-in allowance from the total selling price; the amount of tax due from the retailer with respect to such transaction; the amount of tax collected from the purchaser by the retailer on such transaction (or satisfactory evidence that such tax is not due in that particular instance, if that is claimed to be the fact); the place and date of the sale, a sufficient identification of the property sold, and such other information as the department may reasonably require. Such transaction reporting return shall be filed not later than thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the item that is being sold, but may be filed by the retailer at any time sooner than that if he chooses to do so. The transaction reporting return and tax remittance or proof of exemption from the tax that is imposed by this article may be transmitted to the department by way of the state agency with which, or state officer with whom, the tangible personal property must be titled or registered (if titling or registration is required). With each such transaction reporting return, the retailer shall remit the proper amount of tax due (or shall submit satisfactory evidence that the sale is not taxable if that is the case), to the department or its agents, whereupon the department shall issue, in the purchaser's name, a tax receipt (or a certificate of exemption if the department is satisfied that the particular sale is tax exempt). If the purchaser or user who would otherwise pay tax to the retailer wants the transaction reporting return filed and the payment of tax or proof of exemption made to the department before the retailer is willing to take these actions and such purchaser or user has not paid the tax to the retailer, such purchaser or user may certify to the fact of such delay by the retailer, and may (upon the department being satisfied of the truth of such certification) transmit the information required by the transaction reporting return and the remittance for tax or proof of exemption directly to the department and obtain his tax receipt or exemption determination, in which event the transaction reporting return and tax remittance (if a tax payment was required) shall be credited by the department to the proper retailer's account with the department, but without the two (2) percent discount provided for in this section being allowed. When the purchaser or user pays the tax directly to the department, he shall pay the tax in the same amount and in the same form in which it would be remitted if the tax had been remitted to the department by the retailer. 
(u)  Any retailer filing a return under this section shall also include (for the purpose of paying tax thereon) the total tax, if any, imposed upon him hereunder for the purpose or use of tangible personal property purchased by him at retail from a retailer, but as to which the tax imposed by this article was not collected from the retailer filing such return, and such retailer shall remit the amount of such tax to the department when filing such return. 
(Code 1980, § 26-116; Ord. No. 81-35, § 1, 11-24-1981)  
Sec. 82-377. - Resale numbers assigned to nontaxable purchasers. 
(a)  If the purchaser is not registered with the department as a tax collector, but claims to be a reseller of the tangible personal property in such a way that the purchaser's purchase or use if not taxable under this article or under some other tax law which the department may administer, such purchaser (except in the case of an out-of-city purchaser who will always resell and deliver the property to his customers outside the city) shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for tax under this article or under some other tax law which the department may administer and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to him. The department may cancel any such number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to make a purchase or use tax-free when the purchase in fact is not a purchase for resale, or which no longer applies because of the purchaser's having discontinued the making of resales of the property. Except as provided hereinabove in this section, no purchase or use shall be made tax-free on the ground of the retailer's sale being a sale for resale unless the purchaser has an active registration number or resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any purchase or use by such purchaser is nontaxable because of the retailer's sale being a sale for resale. 
(Code 1980, § 26-117; Ord. No. 81-35, § 1, 11-24-1981)  
Sec. 82-378. - Payment of tax by purchaser to department. 
(a)  Except as to motor vehicles and aircraft, when tangible personal property is purchased from a retailer in the city or for use in the city by a purchaser who did not pay the tax imposed by this article to the retailer, and who does not file returns with the department as a retailer under section 82-376 of this article, such purchaser (by the last day of the month following the calendar month in which such purchaser makes any payment upon the selling price of such property) shall, except as provided in this section, file a return with the department and pay the tax upon that portion of the selling price so paid by the purchaser during the preceding calendar month. When tangible personal property is purchased by a lessor, under a lease for one (1) year or longer, executed or in effect at the time of purchase to an interstate carrier for hire, who did not pay the tax imposed by this article to the retailer, such lessor (by the last day of the month following the calendar month in which such property reverts to the use of such lessor) shall file a return with the department and pay the tax upon the fair market value of such property on the date of such reversion. Such return shall be filed on a form prescribed by the department and shall contain such information as the department may reasonably require. Such return and payment from the purchaser shall be submitted to the department sooner than the last day of the month after the month in which the purchase is made to the extent that they may be necessary in order to secure the title to a motor vehicle or the certificate of registration for an aircraft. 
(b)  When a purchaser pays a tax imposed by this article directly to the department, the department (upon request therefor from such purchaser) shall issue an appropriate receipt to such purchaser showing that he had paid such tax to the department. Such receipt shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which such receipt may refer. A purchaser or user who is liable to pay tax directly to the department only occasionally and not on a frequently recurring basis, and who is not required to file returns with the department as a retailer under section 82-376 of this article, need not register with the department. However, if such a purchaser or user has a frequently recurring direct tax liability to pay to the department, such purchaser or user shall be required to register with the department on forms prescribed by the department and to obtain and display a certificate of registration from the department. In that event, all of the provisions of section 82-376 of this article concerning the filing of regular monthly, quarterly or annual tax returns and all of the provisions of this article concerning the requirements for registrants to post bond or other security with the department, as the provisions now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply to such purchasers or users.

Sec. 82-379. - Failure to file return or pay tax; determination of tax due. 
(a)  In case any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail fails to file a return when and as herein required, but thereafter, prior to the department's issuance of a notice of tax liability under this section, files a return and pays the tax, he shall also pay a penalty of five (5) percent of the amount of the tax. 
(b)  In case any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail files the return at the time required by this article but fails to pay the tax, or any part thereof, when due, a penalty of five (5) percent of the amount of the tax unpaid when due shall be added thereto. 
(c)  In case any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail fails to file a return when and as herein required, but thereafter, prior to the department's issuance of a notice of tax liability under this section, files a return but fails to pay the entire tax, a penalty of five (5) percent of the full amount of tax shown by such return shall be added thereto. 
(d)  In case any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personable property at retail fails to file a return, the department shall determine the amount of tax due from him according to its best judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the department shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown in such determination. In making any such determination of tax due, it shall be permissible for the department to show a figure that represents the tax due for any given period of six (6) months instead of showing the amount of tax due for each month separately. Proof of such determination by the department may be made at any hearing before the department or in any legal proceeding by a reproduced copy of the department's record relating thereto in the name of the department under the certificate of the director. Such reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence before the department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. The department shall issue the tax collector a notice of tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the department to be due, together with a penalty of twenty (20) percent thereof. 
(e)  However, where the failure to file any tax return required under this article on the date prescribed therefor (including any extensions thereof), is due to reasonable cause the penalties impose by this article shall not apply. 
(f)  In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty provided for in this article, or interest, when due, the department may bring suit against the tax collector or the purchaser or user to recover the amount of such tax or portion thereof, or penalty or interest; or, if the tax collector or purchaser or user has died or become incompetent, may file a claim therefor against his estate; provided that no such suit with respect to any tax, or portion thereof, or penalty, or interest shall be instituted more than two (2) years after the latter of the date any proceedings in court for review, thereof have terminated or the time for the filing of such proceedings has expired without such proceedings being instituted, except with the consent of the person from whom such tax or penalty or interest is due; nor, except with such consent, shall such suit be instituted more than two (2) years after the date any return is filed with the department in cases where the return constitutes the basis for the suit or unpaid tax, or portion thereof, or penalty provided for in this article, or interest; provided that the time limitation period on the department's right to bring any such suit shall not run during any period of time in which the order of any court has the effect of enjoining or restraining the department from bringing such suit. 
(g)  The collection of tax or penalty or interest by any means provided for herein shall not be a bar to collection by any other means or to any prosecution under this article. 
(h)  In addition to any penalty provided for in this article amount of tax which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of two (2) percent per month or fraction thereof from the date when such tax becomes past due until such tax is paid or a judgment therefor is obtained by the department; provided however, that if the time for making or completing an audit of a tax collector's books and records is extended with the tax collector's consent, at the request of and for the convenience of the department, beyond the date on which the statute of limitations upon the issuance of a notice of tax liability by the department otherwise would run, no interest shall accrue during the period of such extension.

(a)  Every person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail in the city shall keep records and books of all such sales, together with invoices, sales records, copies of bills of sale, inventories prepared as of December 31 of each year or otherwise annually as has been the custom in the specific trade and other pertinent papers and documents. Every person who is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail in the city and who, in connection with such business, also engages in other activities (including, but not limited to, engaging in a sales of goods occupation) shall keep such additional records and books of all such activities as will accurately reflect the character and scope of such activities and the amount of receipts realized therefrom.

This subsection does not apply to the food and drug exemption. 
(d)  It shall be presumed that all purchases or uses of tangible personal property purchased at retail are subject to tax under this article until the contrary is established, and the burden of proving that a transaction is not taxable hereunder shall be upon the person who would be required to pay the tax or remit the tax to the department if such transaction is taxable. In the course of any audit or investigation or hearing by the department with reference to a given tax collector or purchaser, if the department finds that such person lacks documentary evidence needed to support the claim that no tax is due hereunder, the department is authorized to notify such person in writing to produce such evidence, and such person shall have sixty (60) days subject to the right in the department to extend this period either on request for good cause shown or on its own motion from the date when such notice is sent by certified or registered mail (or delivered if the notice is served personally) in which to obtain and produce such evidence for the department's inspection, failing which the matter shall be closed and the transaction shall be conclusively presumed to be taxable hereunder. 
(e)  Books and records and other papers reflecting receipts received during any period with respect to which the department is authorized to issue notices of tax liability as provided by section 82-379 and this section of this article shall be preserved until the expiration of such period unless the department, in writing shall authorize their destruction or disposal prior to such expiration.

Such process or notice shall be served by the department on the city clerk by leaving, at the office of the city clerk at least fifteen (15) days before the return day of such process or notice, a true and certified copy thereof, and by sending to the taxpayer by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, a like and true certified copy, with an endorsement thereon of the service upon said city clerk, addressed to such taxpayer or tax collector at his last known address. 
(b)  Service of process of notice in the manner provided for in this section, under the circumstances specified in this section, shall be of the same force and validity as if served upon the taxpayer personally within the city. Proof of such service upon the taxpayer through the city clerk as his agent and by mailing to the last known address of the taxpayer may be made in such judicial or administrative proceeding by the affidavit of the director, or by his duly authorized representative who made such service, with a copy of the process or notice that was so served attached to such affidavit.

If the claimant disagrees with the determination, he shall file a protest and challenge thereto within twenty (20) days allowed, the director or his designate, shall fix the time and place for a hearing thereon, giving notice to the claimant thereof, not less than seven (7) days prior thereto. At any hearing held as herein provided, the tentative determination of claim shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the claimant to prove that it is incorrect. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, a decision shall be made by the director and notice thereof given to the claimant. In the event no protest or challenge to the tentative determination of claim is filed within the twenty (20) day period hereinabove set forth, said notice shall thereafter become and operate as a final determination.

If it shall appear to the director that any person has violated any provision of this article or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, or if the amount of any tax payment is incorrect in that it does not include all taxes payable for such calendar quarter or period, or if the director shall find that the collection of any taxes which have accrued but are not year due will be jeopardized by delay, and declares said taxes to be immediately due and payable, or if it shall appear to the director that he has made any final assessment which did not include taxes payable for the periods involved, or if it appears to the director that any person has, by reason of any act or omission or by operation of law, become liable for the payment of any taxes, interest or penalties not originally incurred by him, the director may in any of the above events determine and assess the amount of such taxes of deficiency, as the case may be, together with the interest and penalties due and unpaid, and immediately serve notice upon such person of such determination and assessment and make a demand for payment of the tax together with interest and penalties thereon. If the person incurring any such liability has died, such assessment may at the discretion of the director be made against his personal representative. Such determination and assessment by the director shall be final at the expiration of twenty (20) days from the date of the service of such written notice thereof and demand for payment, unless such person shall have filed with the director a written protest and a petition for a hearing, specifying its objections thereto. Upon the receipt of such petition within the twenty (20) days allowed, the director shall fix the time and place for a hearing and shall notify the petitioner thereof. The director may amend his determination and assessment at any time before it becomes final. In the event of such amendment the person affected shall be given notice thereof and an opportunity to be heard in connection therewith. At any hearing held as herein provided, the determination and assessment that has been made by the director shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting person to prove that it is incorrect. Upon the conclusion of such hearing a decision shall be made by the director either canceling, increasing, modifying or affirming such determination or assessment and notice thereof given to the petitioner. Such notice shall contain a statement by the director of the cost of the certification of the record computed at the rate of five cents ($0.05) per one hundred (100) words, which cost shall be charge to the petitioner if the determination or assessment is affirmed. The record shall consist of the notices and demands caused to be served by the director, the written protest and petition for hearing, the testimony introduced at such hearing, the exhibits produced at such hearing, or certified copies thereof, the decisions of the director and such other documents in the nature of pleadings filed in the proceeding.

Sec. 86-111. - Definitions. 
As used in this article, the following terms shall mean as indicated below: 
Pay telephone means any publicly accessible self-service or coin or credit card operated telephone. 
Person means any natural person or his legal representative, partnership, corporation, company, trust, business entity or association, and any agent, employee, partner, officer, director, stockholder, associate or trustee thereof. 
Public way includes any public street or alley from property line to property line, any city owned parks, any and all sidewalks, and all parkways dedicated to public use. For purposes of this section, a pay telephone will be considered in the public way if any portion of the telephone or its enclosure is situated on or projects or hangs over the public way, or the telephone is so situated that it can be used by a person standing on the public way. 
(Code 1980, § 25-60; Ord. No. 97-67, § 1, 11-13-1997; Ord. No. 98-63, § 1, 10-8-1998)  
Sec. 86-112. - Placement of pay telephones in the public way. 
(a)  The city council shall have the authority to enter into contracts that grant to one (1) or more persons, subject to the conditions set forth in the contract and this article, the privilege of installing and maintaining pay telephones in the public way. The city council may also contract for the removal of telephones illegally installed or maintained in the public way. Any such contract may be approved as to form and legality by the city attorney. In the administration of this article, the city council shall consult and cooperate with all appropriate city departments. The city council may at any time cause to be advertised a request for proposals relating to such contracts. 
(b)  Such contracts and the method of awarding such contracts shall, to the greatest extent possible, be designed to: 
(1)  Discourage illegal drug sales and other criminal activities that are sometimes associated with and facilitated by pay telephones in the public way; 
(2)  Reduce the disturbance that pay telephones may tend to promote in residential areas; 
(3)  Reduce visual clutter in the public way; 
(4)  Reduce the unnecessary obstruction of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(5)  Ensure the availability of pay telephones when they are needed for lawful purposes; and 
(6)  Provide adequate access to pay telephones by disabled persons. 
In addition to those considerations, the contracts may generate revenue for the city. 
(c)  Any contract entered into pursuant to this section shall provide for the privileges granted by the contract to be subject to the city council's authority to order the removal of a pay telephone pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Any such contract shall also permit the city council to require pay telephones in the public way to have special features designed to reduce criminal activity. In addition, the contract must provide that the Alderman must be notified of the location of any pay telephone that is to be situated in the public way in his or her ward pursuant to this section. No person shall be awarded a contract under this section unless the person has a valid certificate of service authority to provide pay telephone service granted by the Illinois Commerce Commission where required by law. 
(d)  No person may install a pay telephone in the public way on or after the effective date of this article unless the installation is made pursuant to a contract entered into under this section. Beginning December 14, 1997, no pay telephone may remain in the public way other than pursuant to a contract entered into under this section. Any telephone installed or maintained in violation of this paragraph shall be subject to immediate removal at the owner's expense by the city. However, in the case of a telephone deemed to be in the public way as the result of this article, no such pay telephone shall be removed until at least seven (7) days after a representative of the city has affixed a notice on the telephone stating that it will be subject to removal within seven (7) days. A list of the locations at which such pay telephones are scheduled to be removed shall be made available for public inspection at least seven (7) days prior to removal of the telephones on the list. 
(e)  No later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this section, every person who owns or maintains a pay telephone in the public way must file with the city clerk a list of the locations of all such telephones owned or maintained by that person. Any pay telephone in the public way that does not appear on such a list shall be subject to immediate removal at the owner's expense by the city beginning thirty-one (31) days after effective date of this section. 
(f)  The city council may, at any time after December 14, 1997, or at any time after the effective date of this section if pursuant to a contract under this section, by ordinance, order the removal of a particular pay telephone that is in the public way. Such an ordinance must identify the location of the telephone to be removed. Any pay telephone that is not removed within fourteen (14) days after the adoption of an ordinance ordering its removal shall be subject to immediate removal by the city at the owner's expense. 
(g)  Any pay telephone removed by the city pursuant to this section may be reclaimed by its owner within thirty (30) days after its removal. The owner must reimburse the city for the removal and storage cost before any such telephone may be reclaimed. Such cost shall also include the costs of removing any installation ancillary to the pay telephone, and the cost of restoring the public way to its original condition. Any telephone not so reclaimed within thirty (30) days may be disposed of as unclaimed property, and any coins remaining in a removed telephone shall become the property of the city and may be used to offset the cost of removal. Any contract for the removal of one (1) or more pay telephones may include a provision, in a form subject to the approval of the city attorney, for indemnification of the contractor by the city against claims and liabilities arising out of performance of the contract. 
(h)  Any person who installs or maintains a pay telephone in violation of this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(i)  The city council shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to implement this section. 
(j)  No provision of this section or any contract issued pursuant to this section may be applied to any transaction in interstate commerce to the extent to which such business may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of regulation by the city. 
(Code 1980, § 25-61; Ord. No. 97-67, § 1, 11-13-1997; Ord. No. 98-63, § 1, 10-8-1998)  
Sec. 86-113. - Outdoor pay telephones prohibited. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall install or maintain any telephone booth, mounted telephone, or any other form of pay telephone or telecommunications device, not enclosed within the interior of a building, unless it is located on the public way and in accordance with section 86-112. Any outdoor pay telephone located on property other than the public way in violation of this section shall be removed by its owner, any person with control over the pay telephone, or the owner of real estate on which the pay telephone is located, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this section, providing, however, that, if within said thirty (30) day period, the owner, person with control over the pay telephone, or the owner of real estate on which the pay telephone is located applies for a revocable certificate of registration as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, such removal shall be abated until a decision to issue or deny a certificate is made. 
(b)  Any person who violates any provision of subsection (a) shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the city council may issue a revocable certificate of registration jointly authorizing the owner of real property on which a telephone is to be located and a telecommunications company that will operate the telephone, subject to the conditions of this section, the installation or maintenance of a telephone booth, mounted telephone, or any other form of pay telephone or telecommunications device, not enclosed within the interior of a building and not on the public way, but permitted by this subsection (c). The certificate of registration shall create no legal rights or entitlements, and shall not be deemed to create any type of vested interest. The application for the certificate of registration shall designate a registered agent for receiving notices under this section. Applications shall be maintained by the City as confidential business records. The certification of registration, unless denied, shall be issued no later than thirty (30) days after a complete application for an eligible location is received. The city council shall issue a certificate of registration pursuant to this section for no more than two (2) telephones per business. No certificate of registration shall authorize a telephone situated 
(1)  On vacant property; 
(2)  On property on which there is situated an abandoned building; 
(3)  On property that is kept, used, maintained, advertised and held out to the public as a place that primarily sells alcoholic liquor at retail; or 
(4)  On property on which there is a building that is used primarily for residential purposes. 
Certificates of registration shall be issued for particular locations identified in the application therefor. The city council by rule may establish and impose an application fee or an annual registration fee or both for certificates of registration issued under this section. A copy of each application for a certificate of registration shall be mailed to the alderman in whose ward the proposed telephone is to be located within five (5) days after the application is received. 
(d)  Whenever the permits and license committee, upon recommendation of the chief of the police department, and/or the public safety committee, determines that it is not in the public interest for the telephone to remain on private property, or that the telephone may have a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood, the city council shall initiate procedures to revoke the certificate of registration for that telephone. A certification by the alderman in whose ward the telephone is or is to be located setting forth facts establishing that it is not in the public interest for the telephone to remain on private property, or that the telephone has a deleterious impact on the surrounding neighborhood, shall be prima facie evidence that the certificate of registration is subject to revocation or should not be issued under this section. Whenever the city council makes such a determination with respect to a telephone for which a certificate of registration has been issued, the city council shall attempt to notify the registrant of the determination by mailing a notice to the registered agent or the registrant, and a representative of the city may enter upon any private property and place upon the telephone a notice stating that the certificate of registration is subject to revocation and that the registrant has a right to request, within seven (7) days of receiving such notice, a preliminary hearing at which the registrant will be given an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the revocation. The preliminary hearing shall be conducted before the public safety committee, shall be informal and shall provide the registrant with an opportunity to address the reasons for the city council's determination. If no preliminary hearing is requested or if the public safety committee determines that there is no reasonable cause for revocation of the certificate of registration after the preliminary hearing, the city council shall issue a notice of revocation and an order requiring the telephone and its appurtenances to be removed within seven (7) days after the order is issued pending a final determination. Telephones that are not timely removed shall be removed by a representative of the city. The owner of a telephone for which a notice of revocation of a certificate of registration has been issued may contest such determination by filing with the city council a request for a final hearing in accordance with section 86-116 of this article. No certificate of registration may be issued for a period of one (1) year after revocation for a telephone at a location with respect to which a previous certificate has been revoked. 
(e)  Outdoor pay telephones not lawfully installed or maintained pursuant to this code are hereby declared to be public nuisances subject to summary abatement upon due notice. A representative of the city may enter upon any private property within the city limits that he has reason to believe contains an outdoor pay telephone in violation of this section and may place upon the telephone a notice that the telephone must be removed within seven (7) days. Such notice shall also provide that if the telephone is not removed within seven (7) days, a representative of the city may remove the telephone and charge the cost of removal jointly and severally to its owner, operator, and the person who owns or controls the real property on which the telephone is located. 
(f)  If the costs to the city of removing telephones and their appurtenances pursuant to this section are not paid within thirty (30) days, the telephone shall be deemed abandoned and may be sold or destroyed. The costs of removing outdoor pay telephones shall be a debt to the city jointly and severally owed by the telephone's owner and operator, and any person who owns or controls the real property on which the telephone is located. Any coins remaining in a removed telephone shall become the property of the city and may be used to offset the cost of removal.

Sec. 86-115. - Indoor payphones restricted. 
Any form of pay telephone or telecommunications device located within the interior of a building shall be limited to one such telephone or device per two thousand (2,000) square feet of interior space. Telephones or devices so permitted under this subsection shall not be subject to registration or licensing provisions otherwise required by this article. 
(Code 1980, § 25-64; Ord. No. 98-63, § 1, 10-8-1998)  
Sec. 86-116. - License denial or revocation. 
The denial by the city council of an application for a contract for telecommunication services on public way or a certificate of registration for telecommunication services on private property or the revocation of said contract or certificate shall be in writing, sent by certified mail to the registered agent listed on the application and shall state the reasons for the denial or revocation. Any person seeking to appeal the denial or revocation may do so by filing a written request for a hearing with the city clerk. Such a request must be filed within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of denial or revocation and a hearing must be held within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request and conducted in accordance with the procedures provided herein. The hearing shall be conducted before an impartial hearing officer appointed by the mayor.

(Code 1980, § 27.1-72; Ord. No. 98-75, § 2, 12-21-1998)  
Sec. 86-152. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; 
(2)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas; 
(3)  Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(4)  Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
(5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(6)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(7)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(8)  Consider the effects on the public health and safety by the existence of communication towers; and 
(9)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to the city's zoning map and existing land uses in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas. 
(Code 1980, § 27.1-71; Ord. No. 98-75, § 1, 12-21-1998)  
Sec. 86-153. - Applicability. 
(a)  New towers and antennas. All new towers or antennas in the city shall be subject to these regulations, except as provided in subsections (b) through (d) of this section, inclusive. 
(b)  Amateur radio station operators/receive-only antennas. This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under seventy (70) feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas. 
(c)  Pre-existing towers or antennas. Pre-existing towers and pre-existing antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements of section 86-154(f) and (g). 
(d)  AM array. For purposes of implementing this article, an AM array, consisting of one (1) or more tower units and supporting ground system, which functions as one (1) AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one (1) tower. Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right. 
(Code 1980, § 27.1-73; Ord. No. 98-75, § 3, 12-21-1998)  
Sec. 86-154. - Requirements. 
(a)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. 
(b)  Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with local development regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot. 
(c)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the director of inspectional services an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one (1) mile of the border thereof, including specified information about the location, height and design of each tower. The director of inspectional services may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the director of inspectional services is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(d)  Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(e)  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(f)  State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(g)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(h)  Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in the city, irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries. 
(i)  Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities. 
(j)  Public notice. For purposes of this article, any special use request, variance request, or appeal of the denial of a special use shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all property owners of properties that are located within the corresponding separation distance listed in section 86-157(b)(5)b, Table 2, in addition to any notice otherwise required by the zoning code. 
(k)  Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower. 
(l)  Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of section 86-158.

Sec. 86-179. - Action on permit applications. 
(a)  City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the city designee within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the city designee shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the city designee is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this article and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the city designee shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the city designee, that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Additional city review of applications of telecommunications retailers. 
(1)  Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence work governed by this article for facilities for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the city not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The city designee shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed. 
(2)  In the event that the city designee fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (i) ten (10) calendar days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) calendar days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this article.

(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-180. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on city rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. 
(c)  Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city designee with such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners. 
(d)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-181. - Revised permit drawings. 
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of "as-built" drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) calendar days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance as defined in this article. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-182. - Insurance. 
(a)  Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, consultants, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) below: 
(1)  Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than: 
a.  Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death to each person; 
(b)  Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage resulting from any one (1) accident; and 
(c)  Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of liability; 
(2)  Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal injury and property damage for each accident; 
(3)  Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and 
(4)  Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident. 
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section. 
(b)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(c)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the city within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of a written request therefor from the city. 
(d)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the City Director of Inspectional Services and City Treasurer of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten (10) calendar days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) calendar days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. 
(e)  Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(f)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(g)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company. 
(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-183. - Indemnification. 
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, consultants, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this article by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. 
(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-184. - Security. 
(a)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this article. 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city. Any letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee; 
2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the city designee, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. The reasonably estimated cost as described above shall be multiplied by one hundred five (105) percent to establish the security fund amount. Such costs shall include, when applicable, the cost of street repair or replacement, sidewalk repair or replacement, landscaping, the cost to repair or replace such other improvements as may exist on the premises prior to construction performed pursuant to the permit and, if necessary, an appropriate reserve to guarantee that landscaping shall survive a one-year period after restoration and to assure that all restoration is completed in a workmanlike manner. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one (1) location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city designee may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The city, upon fourteen (14) calendar days' advanced written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of written notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. 
(Ord. No. 07-128, § 2, 12-13-2007)  
Sec. 86-185. - Permit suspension and revocation. 
(a)  City right to revoke permit. The city may revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this article for one (1) or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete statements in the permit application; 
(2)  Noncompliance with this article; 
(3)  Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare; or 
(4)  Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in accordance with the permit and approved plans. 
(b)  Notice of revocation or suspension. The city shall send written notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this article stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the alternatives available to permittee under this section.

(3)  Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way to the satisfaction of the city providing written proof of such removal to the city within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the written notice of revocation. 
The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods provided in this subsection. 
(d)  Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection (a) of this section. 
(e)  Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the city or its designee may, at the option of the city: (1) correct the deficiencies; (2) upon not less than twenty (20) calendar days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or (3) after not less than thirty (30) calendar days' notice to the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the city for all costs of removal.

A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  [Collocation on utility poles.] The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  [Compliance with codes.] The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  [Compliance with design standards.] The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five (45) feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in subsection 12.6 of the zoning ordinance [appendix B]. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(d)  Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows: 
(1)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars ($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one (1) small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures. 
(2)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable. 
(4)  The city shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:

b.  The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the city at least ten (10) days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with subsection (b)(1)d.; or 
c.  the installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes. 
(5)  Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the city to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures.

(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the city an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 
(1)  Two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year; or 
(2)  The actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the city utility pole. 
If the city has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.

The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the city notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. 
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the city to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the city may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. 
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the city if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the city. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.

Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the city shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute. 
(Ord. No. 18-40, § 3, 7-26-2018)  
Sec. 86-305. - Indemnification. 
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the city harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this article and the Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
(Ord. No. 18-40, § 3, 7-26-2018)  
Sec. 86-306. - Insurance. 
The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: 
(a)  Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all risks; 
(b)  Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or 
(c)  Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the city improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of city improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage. 
The wireless provider shall include the city as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the city in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the city. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the city.

The following words, terms, and phrases, when used herein, shall have ascribed to them the following meanings, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Automated traffic law enforcement system means a device within the city with one (1) or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code ("Code"), 625 ILCS 5/11-306, or similar violation of the City Municipal Code. 
Disregarding a traffic control device means failure to stop and remain stopped before an intersection that is controlled by a red signal as provided for in Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of the City Municipal Code. 
No turn on red means where the motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection as defined by Section 1-132 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one (1) or more pedestrians are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop, as specified in subsection (c) of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of the City Municipal Code. 
Recorded images means images produced by the automated traffic law enforcement system, which consists of either two (2) or more photographs; two (2) or more microphotographs; two (2) or more electronic images; or a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one (1) image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate number of the motor vehicle. 
Traffic compliance administrator means the person appointed as ordinance enforcement administrator through section 2-943 of the City Municipal Code and shall have the following additional powers: adopt, distribute and process automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this division, collect money paid as fines and penalties, operate the automated traffic law enforcement system, and make certified reports to the Secretary of State as required by this division. 
(Ord. No. 10-68, § 2, 12-21-2010)  
Sec. 90-82. - Violations. 
It shall be a violation of this division for a vehicle to disregard a traffic control device or turn on red in violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. All violations must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer of the city. 
(Ord. No. 10-68, § 2, 12-21-2010)  
Sec. 90-83. - Defenses. 
The following may be considered defenses by the hearing officer for a violation of section 90-82: 
(1)  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation; 
(2)  That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession. 
To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. 
(Ord. No. 10-68, § 2, 12-21-2010)  
Sec. 90-84. - Notice of violation. 
When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of section 90-82, the city shall issue a written notice of violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S. mail within thirty (30) days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the city of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than ninety (90) days following the violation. The city shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within sixty (60) days of the notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided within sixty (60) days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office-approved database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first-class mail, postage prepaid. 
A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of section 90-82, or whether one (1) of the defenses enumerated in section 90-83 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this division. 
The notice of violation shall include the following information:

(10)  A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle; 
(11)  A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation; 
(12)  A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing; and

(4)  A person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove liability. Upon a request for a hearing, the ordinance enforcement officer shall schedule the hearing for the next regular hearing date. 
(5)  Documentary evidence which would conclusively disprove liability shall be based solely on the following grounds:

b.  That the registered owner has not accumulated three (3) or more final determinations of parking violation or automated traffic law enforcement system liability which were unpaid at the time the notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued. 
(6)  The hearing on eligibility for impoundment shall not provide a venue for a collateral attack on the original determinations of liability except to contest service of process. 
(Ord. No. 11-9, § 2, 2-24-2011)  
Sec. 90-97. - Post-immobilization towing notice.

(Ord. No. 11-9, § 2, 2-24-2011)  
Sec. 90-99. - Post-immobilization hearing. 
(a)  The owner of an immobilization vehicle shall have the right to a post-immobilization hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing and impoundment was erroneous, if the owner files a written request for a hearing with the ordinance enforcement officer within fourteen (14) days after immobilization or fourteen (14) days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to subsection (b) herein, whichever is later. The determination of the hearing officer regarding the validity of the immobilization shall become final for the purpose of judicial review under the Administrative Review Law of Illinois upon issuance.

The notice shall state that failure to pay the amount owing within forty-five (45) days of the date of the notice will result in the city notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings pursuant to ILCS ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-306.5, the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(b)  If a person sent a notice pursuant to subsection (a) above fails to pay the amount owing within the time stated on the notice, the ordinance enforcement officer may file with the Secretary of State, a certified report, in accordance with Section 6-206.5(c) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings.

The ordinance enforcement officer shall send notice of the decision on the challenge of the report after receipt thereof. The challenge to the eligibility for suspension proceedings, and any hearing requested under subsection (e) below, shall not provide a venue for a collateral attack on the original determinations of liability except to contest service of process.

(1)  Obedience to and required traffic-control devices. 
(a)  The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official traffic-control device applicable thereto placed or held in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise directed by a police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle in this chapter. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any person to leave the roadway and travel across private property to avoid an official traffic-control device. 
(c)  No provision of this chapter for which official traffic-control devices are required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation an official device is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section does not state that official traffic-control devices are required, such section shall be effective even though no devices are erected or in place. 
(d)  Whenever any official traffic-control device is placed or held in position approximately conforming to the requirements of this chapter and purports to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining to such device, such device shall be presumed to have been so placed or held by the official act or direction of lawful authority, and comply with the requirements of this chapter, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence. 
(e)  The driver of a vehicle approaching a traffic-control signal on which no signal light facing such vehicle is illuminated shall stop before entering the intersection in accordance with rules applicable in making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Conformance to standards prescribed by state law; maintenance and placement. All official traffic-control devices designated for a particular purpose shall conform to the standards adopted in accordance to law by the department of transportation. 
(3)  Traffic-control signal legend. 
(a)  Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
1.  Green indication 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in subsection (4), pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
2.  Steady yellow indication 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subsection (4), are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
3.  Steady red indication 
a.  Except as provided in subsection (3)(a)3.c. of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
b.  Except as provided in subsection (3)(a)3.c. of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown. 
c.  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subsection (3)(a)3.a. or b. of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk. 
d.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subsection (4), pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  If an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal. 
(4)  Pedestrian-control signals. Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Don't Walk" or the illuminated symbols of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place such signals shall indicate as follows: 
(a)  Walk or walking person symbol. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles. 
(b)  Don't walk or upraised palm symbol. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partly completed his crossing on the walk signal or walking person symbol shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the "Don't Walk" signal or upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady, or flashing. 
(5)  Flashing signals. Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in conjunction with a traffic-control device it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(a)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(b)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(c)  Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by applicable provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(6)  Display of unauthorized signs, signals or markings. 
(a)  No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic-control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or which hides from view or interferes with the movement of traffic or the effectiveness of an official traffic-control device or any railroad sign or signal. 
(b)  No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising. 
(c)  Every such prohibited sign, signal or marking is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway is hereby empowered to remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice. 
(7)  Interference with official traffic-control devices or railroad signs or signals. No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter, deface, injure, knock down, or remove any official traffic-control device; or any railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield, or insignia thereon; or any other part thereof.

To conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the City of Calumet City; 
To provide for the elimination of nonconforming uses of land, buildings and structures which are adversely affecting the character and value of desirable development in each district.

Any lawfully established use of a building or land, on the effective date of the ordinance or of amendments thereto, that does not conform to the use of regulations for the district in which it is located, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided herein. 
Any legal, nonconforming building or structure may be continued in use provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair, as otherwise permitted herein. 
Any building for which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of the ordinance, or of amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within ninety (90) days and diligently prosecuted to completion.

Purpose. The zoning board of appeals, after a public hearing, may recommend that the city council vary the regulations of this ordinance in harmony with their general purpose and intent, only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth and only where the board of appeals made findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter prescribed, and further finds that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this ordinance.

Standards for variations. 
The zoning board of appeals shall not recommend a variance in the regulations of this ordinance, unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that each and all the standards for hardships set forth in the Illinois Municipal Code are complied with and specifically that: 
(a)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if a strict letter of regulations were carried out. 
(b)  The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification. 
(c)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the ordinance and has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property. 
(d)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(e)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this subsection, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and to better carry out the general intent of this ordinance. 
Authorized variation. 
Variations from the regulations of this ordinance shall be recommended by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the standards established in the above subsection, and may be granted only in the following instances and in not others: 
(a)  To permit any yard or setback less than the yard to setback required by the applicable regulations, but by not more than twenty-five (25) percent. 
(b)  To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than eighty (80) percent of the required area and width. The percentage set forth in this subparagraph is not to be reduced by any other percentage for minimum lot width and area set forth in this ordinance. 
(c)  To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided the substantial use of such facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week. 
(d)  To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than one (1) parking space or loading space, or twenty (20) percent of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater.

(h)  To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this section, when a lot of record or a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on the effective date of this ordinance, is by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by any authorized governmental body or by reason of the conveyance under threat of an eminent domain proceeding reduced in size so that the remainder of said lot of record or zoning lot or structure on said lot does not conform with one (1) or more of the regulations of the district in which said lot of record or zoning lot or structure is located. 
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to recommend a variation. 
12.7 Special uses. 
Purpose. The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of building and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are uses which because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular user at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories. 
(a)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; 
(b)  Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
Initiation of special uses. Any person owning or having an interest in the subject property may file an application to use such land for one (1) or more of the special uses provided for in this ordinance in the zoning district in which the land is situated. 
Application for special use. An application for a special use or expansion of a special use shall be filed with the city clerk and shall be accompanied by a site development plan and landscape plan in accord with subsections 12.9 and 12.10 of this ordinance. 
Hearing on application. Upon receipt of the application referred to above, the zoning board of appeals shall hold at least one (1) public hearing. At least fifteen (15) days in advance of such hearings, but not more than thirty (30) days, notice of time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Calumet City. 
Authorization. For each application for a special use, the zoning board of appeals shall report to the city council its findings and recommendations, including the stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. The city council may grant or deny any application for a special use, provided, however, that in the event of written protest against any proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage adjacent thereto, or across an alley, or directly opposite therefrom, such special use shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 )of all the members of the city council. 
Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the zoning board of appeals unless said zoning board of appeals shall find: 
(a)  That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be unreasonably detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare; 
(b)  That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(c)  That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; 
(d)  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
(e)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress or egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; 
(f)  That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the city council pursuant to the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals. 
Conditions and guarantees. Prior to granting any special use, the mayor and city council shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of a special use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified herein, or as may be from time to time required. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the mayor and city council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied with. 
Effect of denial of a special use. After a public hearing, no application for a special use which has been denied wholly or in part by the mayor and city council shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said order of denial, except on the grounds of substantial new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the zoning board of appeals, the mayor and city council. 
Termination of special use permit. If work on the proposed development has not begun within six (6) months from the date of the authorization order of the mayor and city council, the authorization shall become null and void and all rights thereunder shall lapse. Upon written application, filed prior to the termination of the six (6) months time limit, the mayor and the city council may authorize a single extension of the time limit for a further period of not more than one (1) year.

12.9 State StreetState Line Road Redevelopment Area site development plan review. 
(1)  Authority. The city council and the city council committee on development, subject to the procedures provided herein, have the authority to approve or disapprove site development plans required to be submitted for approval under this section. 
(2)  Purpose. Site plan review and approval is required to ensure that the use and development of land within the State StreetState Line Road Redevelopment Project Area is undertaken in an orderly and proper manner which furthers the public health, safety and welfare and makes adequate provision to ensure the available of appropriate public and private services and amenities and for minimizing the adverse effects of such development. 
The design, orientation and location of open spaces, buildings, structures and signs visible from public streets, places and ways has a material and substantial relationship to property values and the taxable values of property in the city and the cost of the municipal services provided thereto. Further, many neighborhoods in other urban and suburban communities have deteriorated in the past by reason of the lack of planning, neglect of proper maintenance standards and the erection of buildings and structures unsuitable to and incompatible with the character of the neighborhood or area, resulting in a reduction in property values. 
Therefore, it is the policy of the city that these regulations be adopted to arrest and prevent deterioration of the function, character and appearance of the State Street and State Line Road Redevelopment Area; provide a favorable environment for residents and businesses; and preserve and enhance the general public welfare. 
(3)  Approved plan, when required. 
Site plan approval shall be required for any nonresidential development within the State StreetState Line Road Redevelopment Area, as illustrated in Figure 1, and under the following intended situations: 
(a)  Any new principal structure intended and designed for nonresidential occupancy (or complete redevelopment of any site for nonresidential use) or the use of land for nonresidential purposes. 
 
Figure 1, State Street - State Line Road Redevelopment Area 
(b)  Where an existing principal structure erected prior to the date of adoption of these site plan requirements is proposed to be expended, for which the sum total of gross floor area expansion(s) since the date of these requirements are equal to or greater than thirty-five (35) percent of the total gross floor area of said structure. 
(c)  Any new or modified building and/or site improvements for a zoning lot which has previously received site plan approval under this ordinance. Reapproval of the plan is required for components of the plan which depart from the approved site plan. The extent of changes to be incorporated in the submittal for reapproval shall be determined by the building commissioner. 
(d)  A site plan shall not be required as a result of a change of use, except where such change of use results in increased off-street parking requirements which are not currently met on the site. 
(e)  A site plan shall be required along with any application for a special use permit or a special use permit amendment for any nonresidential development. 
(f)  These requirements exclude the legal reconstruction of legally nonconforming buildings, when such buildings and related improvements are substantially restored consistent with their prior condition. 
Site plan review is not required as part of planned development approval (subsection 12.8), but may apply to development of individual sites following approval of a special use planned unit development, as controlled by the ordinance granting planned development approval.

(a)  Minimum planting sizes shall be as follows: 
1.  Large deciduous shade treesThree (3) inches caliper as measured six (6) inches above ground. 
2.  Medium deciduous shade treesTwo and one-half (2.5) inches caliper as measured six (6) inches above ground. 
3.  Small deciduous and ornamental treesEight (8) feet in height, with the exception of true dwarf species. 
4.  EvergreensSix (6) feet in height. 
5.  ShrubsTwenty-four (24) inches. 
6.  Ground cover plants, whether in the form of crowns, plugs or containers, shall be planted in numbers appropriate by species to provide fifty (50) percent surface coverage after one (1) growing season. 
(b)  Methods of determining planting sizes shall be as follows: This section outlines acceptable specifications for shade trees and flowering trees. 
1.  Shade and flowering trees. In size grading baled and burlapped trees, caliper size shall take precedence over tree height. For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be listed. That size will be the minimum size allowable for that grade and shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Acer rubrum, two (2) inch caliper. This could include Acer rubrum calipering two (2) inches up to but not including two and one-half (2½) inches in caliper, measured six (6) inches above the ground line.) 
The caliper of the trunk shall be taken six (6) inches above the ground up to and including four (4) inch caliper size, and twelve (12) inches above the ground for larger sizes. Seldom are tree trunks perfectly round. Therefore, caliper measurement may be taken with "slot" type caliper, "pincer" type caliper, or diameter tape. 
2.  Conifers and evergreens. For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be used. That size will be the minimum size allowable for the grade, and the grade shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Taxus media "Brownii" fifteen (15) inches. This could include Taxus media "Brownii" fifteen (15) inches in height up to but not including eighteen (18) inches and having a minimum spread of twelve (12) inches.) 
The following height measurement units shall apply: Three-inch intervals up to eighteen (18) inches in height. Six-inch intervals from eighteen (18) inches to four (4) feet one (1) foot intervals greater than four (4) feet. 
3.  Deciduous shrubs. This section outlines acceptable specifications for deciduous shrubs, dwarf and semi-dwarf shrubs and strong growing shrubs. 
For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be used. That size will be the minimum size allowable for that grade, and the grade shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Forsythia, two (2) feet. This could include Forsythia plants with not less than three (3) two 920 foot canes up to but not including four (4) three-foot canes.) 
Dwarf and semi-dwarf shrubs. Determine height in inches up to twenty-four (24) inches; above twenty-four (24) inches determine height in feet. Grade in three-inch series to eighteen (18) inches, six-inch series eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches. (example 12 in.; 15 in.; 18 in.; 2 ft.; 2½ ft.) 
Strong growing shrubs. Determine height in six-inch series up to twenty-four (24) inches tall (example: 12 in., 18 in.); over twenty-four (24) inches, measure in single feet up to six (6) feet tall; over six (6) feet; measure in two (2) foot increments. (Example: 5 ft., 6 ft., 8 ft., 10 ft.) 
(c)  Ground cover specifications. All open areas of the development which are not paved, sodded or otherwise landscaped shall have a new lawn established through seeding.

(11)  Landscaping maintenance. Trees, shrubs, and other landscaping materials depicted on landscaping plans approved by the city shall be considered to be elements of the project in the same manner as parking, building materials and other details. The developer, its successor and/or subsequent owners and their agents shall be responsible for maintenance of landscaping on the property on a continuing basis for the life of the development. Plant materials which exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease and/or damage shall be appropriately treated, and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting season after installation. All landscaping will be subject to periodic inspection by the building commissioner, or his or her designee. Should landscaping not be installed, maintained and replaced as needed to comply with the approved plan, the owner and its agent or agents shall be considered in violation of the terms of the certificate of occupancy. The building commissioner is empowered to enforce the terms of this article. 
(a)  As a condition to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of twenty-five (25) percent of the initial landscaping costs shall be posted to ensure the needed replacement of materials and the continued maintenance of the same for a period of two (2) years after initial installation. Said cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit may be forfeited if the necessary maintenance and replacement has not been performed in a satisfactory manner within the two (2) year period. Further, should it be determined that the landscaping as approved on the landscaping plan is not being maintained as specified beyond the initial two (2) year maintenance period, resubmission of the approved plan and the posting of an additional maintenance escrow may be required by the city. 
(12)  Administrative relief. A written application for administrative relief of [from] the requirements of subsections (4), (5) and (6) may be filed with the building commissioner as part of an application for landscape plan approval. Nineteen (19) copies of the application and all supporting documentation shall be submitted. Such application shall be submitted with the landscape plan and demonstrate the following: 
(a)  The strict application of the regulation in question is unreasonable given the development proposal or the measures proposed by the applicant, or, that the property has extraordinary or exceptional physical conflicts that do not generally exist in nearby properties in the same zoning district and such conditions will not allow a reasonable use of the property in absence of relief. 
(b)  Dependent upon the approval process under which the application for relief is sought, the approving authority shall make the final decision upon whether any relief from these requirements may be approved. 
(c)  In granting any administrative relief, the city council, or city council committee on development, may require alternative improvements, or stipulate such conditions as appropriate. 
(13)  Effect of approval; plan revisions. An application may be made following the initial submission of a landscape plan to propose alternatives or changes to the approved plan or any plans pending approval, or as may be requested by the city. Any alterations or changes to a plan document upon resubmission to the building commissioner shall include plan copies required under subsection (3), above together with a written statement indicating all changes made and a revision block on the face of the plan(s) indicating each date of revision. 
All plan changes shall be represented on the face of the plan(s) by notation encompassing the area of change and with reference to the written statement of changes. Except where changes are noted, the content of the plan is presumed to be that of the last plan accepted by the building commissioner. The building commissioner may reject any plan changes where insufficient documentation of the location and nature of the change(s) lends the proposed revisions uninterpretable. 
Any proposed changes to a landscape plan following final action on the plan shall constitute a new application subject to the procedures and requirements of this subsection.

If, after a bona fide effort to determine such address by the applicant for amendment, the owner of the property on which the notice is served cannot be found at his last known address, or the mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be found at the last known address, the notice requirements of this ordinance shall be deemed satisfied. In addition to serving the notice herein required, at the time of hearing on the application, the applicant shall furnish to the board of appeals a complete list containing the names and last known addresses of the owners of the property required to be served, the method of service and the names and last known addresses of the persons so served.

(3)  If an application for a proposed amendment is not acted upon finally by the city council within six (6) months of the date upon which such application is received by the mayor and city council, it shall be deemed to have been denied.
