CHINO HILLS, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
2001 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of  
the City of Chino Hills, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18,  
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
> 
PREFACE 
    The Chino Hills Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 2001, has been 
kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 18, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by 
regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of 
Book Publishing Company under the direction of Linda Ruth, city clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering 
system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing 
provisions. Each Section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, Chapter, and 
Section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, 
Sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original 
Sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, Chapters and Titles are numbered to provide for 
internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each Section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the 
provisions of that Section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, 
following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in 
the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code 
Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by 
individual Section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance Number 337, passed April 9, 
2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city 
employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important 
elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses 
a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. 
It is based on three tiers, beginning with Title, then Chapter, and ending with Section. Each part is 
represented in the code Section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 
of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A Title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code 
contains about 15 to 20 Titles. For example, the first Title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may 
contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The Titles in this code are 
separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some Titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the 
Chapters on a related subject are grouped in one Title. The Chapters are numbered so that new Chapters 
which should logically be placed near certain existing Chapters can be added at a later time without 
renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, 
City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each Section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The Sections are numbered by 
"tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the 
beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each Title. In addition, each Title and Chapter 
has its own table of contents listing the Chapters and Sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code Section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying 
ordinances for that Section. The ordinances are listed by number, Section (if applicable) and year. 
(Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected 
Sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. 
These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing 
at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are 
applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older 
or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, 
under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code Section in the column labeled "Prior 
Code Section" and the new code Section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the Section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List 
and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion 
in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the 
disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the Chapter (or Chapters) will be indicated. 
(Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally 
codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the 
ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the 
disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," 
"(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and 
Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No.18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added 
for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological 
listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List 
specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the 
code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can 
locate any Section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an 
alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses Section numbers as the reference, and cross-references 
where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX  
Fee 5.04.030  
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell 
the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that 
supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be 
inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. 
Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is 
amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. 
(Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left 
unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if 
at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have 
a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a 
diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure 
that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have 
been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent 
nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general 
and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Municipal Code will be able to 
gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

inspection, police, or other functions, unless the context requires otherwise, all references shall be to 
the appropriate or designated office, officer, department, agency, employee, or function of the city, or

resolutions, it shall mean the geographical limits of Chino Hills unless a different geographical 
area is clearly indicated by the context. 
C. ?Whenever "county," "county of San Bernardino," or "unincorporated territory of the county of 
San Bernardino" is used, it shall mean the city of Chino Hills unless a geographical area is 
clearly indicated by the context. 
D. ?Whenever "Planning Commission" is used in the San Bernardino County Code, county 
documents, or county resolutions, it shall mean the Planning Commission of the city of Chino 
Hills. 
E. ?Whenever "Subdivision Committee" or "Committee" is used in the San Bernardino County 
Code, county documents, or county resolutions, it shall mean the Chino Hills Planning 
Commission. 
F. ?Whenever "Zoning Administrator" is used in the San Bernardino County Code, county 
documents, or county resolutions, it shall mean the Chino Hills Director of Community 
Development. 
G. ?Whenever the San Bernardino County Code, county documents, or county resolutions, refer to 
any other officer, office, official title, or designation, the reference shall be interpreted to mean 
that a similar office, title, or designation in the governmental structure in the city, as determined 
by the City Manager, or if there is no equivalent office, title, or designation, then the City 
Manager may delegate the responsibility to the official or employee of his or her choosing.

revising the provisions of the Chino Hills Municipal Code and such reference or revision is designed to 
modify the San Bernardino County Code as adopted by the city, the following reference shall be made: 
    Section _______ of the San Bernardino County Code, as the same was/were incorporated by 
reference into the Chino Hills Municipal Code by City Ordinance No. 91-01 and 92-02, shall be used to 
describe the San Bernardino County Code sections being modified or referred to in City Ordinances,

    Any person who violates any provision of the San Bernardino County Code as adopted by reference 
by the city of Chino Hills by city Ordinances 91-01 and 92-02 is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon 
conviction of such violation shall be punished in accordance with Section 1.36.010 et seq. of the Chino 
Hills Municipal Code.

defined in California Government Code Section 34871, meaning one member of the City 
Council shall be elected from each district, by the voters of that district alone. Each member of 
the City Council shall serve a four-year term until his or her successor is qualified. 
2. ?Except during the transition period as provided in subdivision (4) of this section, the Council 
member elected or appointed to represent a district must reside in that district and be a 
registered voter in that district, and any candidate for City Council must reside in, and be a 
registered voter in, the district in which he or she seeks election at the time nomination papers 
are issued, pursuant to California Government Code Section 34882 and Elections Code Section 
10227. 
3. ?Termination of residency in a district by a Council member shall create a vacancy for that 
council district unless a substitute residence within the district is immediately declared and 
established within thirty days after the termination of residency. If a substitute residence is not 
established within thirty days after the termination of residency, the Council member's office 
shall be deemed vacant on the thirty-first day after the termination of residency. Notwithstanding 
the previous sentence, if the Council member who terminates residency in a district submits a 
letter of resignation effective immediately, or the City Council declares the existence of a 
vacancy by a resolution reciting the circumstances creating the vacancy and the date on which 
the vacancy commences, the vacancy shall begin as and when set forth in the letter of the 
Council member or the resolution of the City Council. A vacancy on the City Council may be

four-year term of each Council member, that Council member's successor shall be elected on a 
by-district basis in the districts established in Section 1.14.020 and as provided in Section 
1.14.030. In 2018, the full four-year term of three Council members will expire and each of their 
successors shall be elected by-district in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 
1.14.030. In 2020, the full four-year term of two Council members will expire and each of their 
successors shall be elected by-district in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 
1.14.030. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit a Council member in office on the 
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives from seeking election to an 
additional term, provided the Council Member is otherwise qualified under this chapter and 
other applicable laws. 
5. ?In the event a vacancy occurs in a City Council Office before the expiration of the four-year term 
of a City Council Office at the time this Ordinance is adopted, a person who is appointed or 
elected by special election to fill such vacancy may reside anywhere within the corporate 
boundaries of the City. A person appointed or elected to fill such a vacancy shall hold the office 
for the remainder of the term of that office pursuant to Government Code Section 36512 and

(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.060 - Compliance orders. 
A. ?Issuing Compliance Orders. Before issuing an administrative citation for any violation of building, 
plumbing, electrical, mechanical, or similar structural or zoning regulations set forth in this code or 
incorporated by reference, or any violation of Title 15 or 16 of this code, the enforcement officer must 
first issue a written compliance order to the person(s) responsible for the violation unless the 
violation constitutes an immediate threat to public health or safety. The compliance order must 
contain all of the following: 
1. ?The date on which, and geographic location where, the violation was observed; 
2. ?The section number of this code violated; 
3. ?A description of the conditions causing the code violation; 
4. ?Actions required to correct the violation; 
5. ?A reasonable time period for the correction of the violation; and 
6. ?Notice that if the violation is not corrected by the date specified in the compliance order, that an 
administrative citation may be issued and administrative fines imposed for failure to correct 
violations by the date specified. 
B. ?Correction of Violation. No further action is required if the enforcement officer determines that all 
violations in the compliance order were cured. If the enforcement officer determines that all violations 
were not corrected within the time specified, an administrative citation may be issued to each person 
named in the compliance order as a responsible person. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.070 - Administrative fines. 
A. ?Any responsible person who receives an administrative citation is subject to the payment of fines as 
set out in the penalty schedule for administrative fines as adopted by City Council resolution. An 
administrative penalty may be assessed by means of an administrative citation issued by an 
enforcement officer, and is payable directly to the City Treasurer. A portion of each penalty 
constitutes reimbursement for the city's administrative expenses in issuing and processing the 
citation. Penalties must be collected in accordance with the procedures specified in this chapter. 
Payment of a penalty does not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor does it bar further 
enforcement action by the city. In the case of violations of the building, plumbing or electrical codes, 
or Title 15 or 16 of this code, an administrative citation cannot be issued until after the responsible 
party is provided notice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the violation, and failed to do so. 
B. ?Payment of Administrative Fines. An administrative citation fine must be paid to the city within thirty 
(30) days from the date of the administrative citation fine or, if a request for an initial administrative 
review is submitted and the review held, then within fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice of 
the conclusion of that initial administrative review, whichever is later. 
C. ?Delinquency Penalty. Any person who fails to pay to the city the amount of any fine imposed 
pursuant to the provisions of this section, is liable for the payment of an additional delinquency 
penalty. The delinquency penalty is equal to one hundred (100) percent of the amount due the city 
not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), or if a portion of the fine amount was timely paid one 
hundred (100) percent of the amount of the fine remaining unpaid to the city not to exceed one 
hundred dollars ($100.00). 
D. ?Failure of any person to pay the fines assessed by an administrative citation may result in the matter 
being referred for collection which may include, without limitation, the filing of a small claims court 
action. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.080 - Issuing permits or licenses. 
    If an enforcement officer issues an administrative citation because the citee lacks a required permit 
(as that term is defined in section 16.02.280) or license required by this code, and the fine is delinquent, 
the city will not issue the permit or license, until the delinquent fine, and any applicable penalties and 
interest, is paid. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.090 - Administrative review and hearing. 
A. ?Initial Administrative Review-Request. The citee may request an initial administrative review of the 
citation within fifteen (15) days of its issuance by submitting a request to the City Clerk. This request 
must be made in writing and set forth with particularity the reasons the citee believes a violation did 
not occur or that the citee was not responsible for the violation(s); must include a copy of the citation; 
and contain the address to which the conclusions of the city's review should be mailed. A request for 
an initial administrative review is a mandatory prerequisite to a request for an administrative hearing. 
B. ?Initial Administrative Review-Procedure. The City Clerk will forward the initial administrative review 
request to the department director supervising the enforcement officer who issued the administrative 
citation for review. 
C. ?Initial Administrative Review-Decision. 
1. ?Within fifteen (15) days upon receiving the request, the department director will review the 
request and provide the City Clerk with written notification that: 
a. ?The citation should be vacated because there was no violation, or the citee was not 
responsible for the violation, and setting forth the basis for that conclusion; or 
b. ?There is no justification found for vacating the citation. 
2. ?The City Clerk will mail a copy of the decision to the citee at the address on the request for initial 
administrative review along with a notice establishing the fine due date and the procedure for 
requesting an administrative hearing. 
D. ?Request for Hearing. If the citee wishes to contest the conclusion of the initial administrative review, 
the citee must request an administrative hearing within fifteen (15) days after the date the city served 
the citee with notice of the initial administrative review decision. Requests must be submitted to the 
City Clerk and be accompanied by an advance deposit of the fine or request a hardship waiver. 
E. ?Hardship Waiver. Citees financially unable to make an advance deposit of the administrative fine 
may file for a hardship waiver. The request must be filed with the City Clerk. 
1. ?The City Clerk will review the request and determine whether a waiver is justified. A waiver may 
only be approved if the request for waiver is accompanied by an affidavit signed under penalty 
of perjury, together with any supporting documents or materials demonstrating the citee's actual 
financial inability to deposit the full amount of the fine. 
2. ?The City Clerk will inform the citee in writing within fifteen (15) days regarding whether the 
waiver was approved. The determination must be served upon the citee by mail at the address 
provided in the waiver application. The City Clerk's determination is final. 
3. ?Should the City Clerk determine that a waiver is unjustified, the citee must deposit the fine 
amount with the city not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of that decision. Failure to 
make a deposit within fifteen (15) days after waiver denial is deemed a waiver of the citee's right 
to an administrative hearing and the administrative fine will be deemed delinquent. 
F. ?Notification of Hearing. Upon receipt of the payment of the administrative fine and request for a 
hearing, the city shall give notice to the citee of the time, date, and location of the hearing. The 
hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of 
the request. Any documentation, other than the administrative citation, that the enforcement official 
has submitted or will submit to the hearing officer shall be sent to the citee by regular first class mail 
at least five days before the date on which the hearing is scheduled. The documentation shall be 
made available upon request at the time of the hearing. 
G. ?Selection of hearing officer. The City Manager may designate the hearing officer for the 
administrative citation hearing by appointment or contract. 
H. ?Evidentiary Rules. The city bears the burden of proving a violation of the code by a preponderance 
of the evidence. The administrative citation and any additional reports submitted by the enforcement 
official constitutes prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents. Both 
the citee and the enforcement officer have the opportunity to testify, cross-examine witnesses and 
present additional evidence concerning the administrative citation. Evidence may include, without 
limitation, witness testimony, documents, or other similar evidence. Formal rules of evidence do not 
apply, but all evidence presented must be relevant and material to the issues of whether the violation 
alleged in the citation occurred or whether the citee was responsible for the violation. 
I. ?Waiver of Personal Appearance at Hearing. In lieu of personally appearing at an administrative 
hearing, the citee may request that the hearing officer decide the matter based upon the citation itself 
and written argument and any documentary evidence signed under penalty of perjury submitted prior 
to the time of the scheduled hearing by the citee. 
J. ?Failure to Appear at Hearing. Failure of a citee to appear at the hearing is deemed a waiver of the 
right to be personally present at the hearing. The hearing officer must then decide the matter based 
upon the citation itself, any documentary evidence previously submitted, and any additional evidence 
that may be presented at the hearing by the enforcement officer. 
K. ?Attendance of Enforcement Officer. The enforcement officer who issued the administrative citation 
may, but is not required to, attend the administrative hearing. If the enforcement officer does not 
attend, the enforcement officer may before the hearing date submit reports, photos, or other 
documentation regarding the violation to the hearing officer for consideration at the hearing. 
L. ?Continuation of Hearings. The hearing officer may continue any hearing and request additional 
information from the enforcement officer or citee before issuing a written decision. 
M. ?Decision of Hearing Officer. Based upon the evidence presented, the hearing officer shall provide a 
written decision to the parties within fifteen (15) days of the hearing with one of the following 
determinations: 
1. ?Determine that the violation for which the citation was issued occurred, and impose a fine in the 
amount set forth in the fine and penalty schedule, and if the violation has not been corrected as 
of the date of the hearing, order correction or abatement of the violation. In this event, the city 
can retain the fine deposited by the responsible person. 
2. ?Determine that the violation for which the citation was issued occurred, but that the responsible 
party has introduced credible evidence of mitigating circumstances warranting imposition of a 
lesser fine than that prescribed in the fine and penalty schedule, or no fine at all, and impose 
such lesser fine, if any; and if the violation has not been corrected as of the date of the hearing, 
order correction or abatement of the violation. In this event, the city can retain all or a portion of 
the fine deposited by the responsible person as applicable. 
3. ?Determine that the violation for which the citation was issued did not occur or that the condition 
did not constitute a violation of this code, or that the person cited was not the responsible party. 
In this event, the city shall refund the deposit, if any, within fifteen (15) days of the decision. A 
finding by the hearing officer that no violation occurred constitutes a dismissal of the 
administrative citation at issue, but does not have any effect on any other administrative 
citations issued or any other action taken by the city. 
4. ?The administrative hearing officer's decision must explain the basis for the decision and be 
served upon the responsible party by first class mail to the address stated on the request for 
hearing form. If applicable, the order must set forth the date by which compliance must be 
achieved and the imposed fine paid to the city. The order is final on the date of mailing, which is 
deemed the "date of service," and must notify the responsible person of the right to appeal to 
the Superior Court, as further described in Section 1.18.100. There is no right to an appeal 
other than as provided in Section 1.18.100. Should the hearing officer uphold the administrative 
citation and a hardship waiver was previously granted, the due date for paying the 
administrative fine will be thirty (30) days from the date of the notice of the hearing officer's 
decision. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.100 - Judicial review/right to appeal. 
    If an administrative order is rendered in favor of the city, the citee may seek judicial review of the 
administrative order in the San Bernardino County Superior Court, Chino District, by filing an appeal of 
the administrative order pursuant to, and paying the fee required by, Government Code § 53069.4 within 
twenty (20) days after service of the administrative order. Pursuant to Government Code § 53069.4, the 
appealing party must serve a copy of the notice of appeal in person or by first-class mail upon the City 
Clerk. If no notice of appeal is filed within the twenty (20) day period, the decision is final. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


1.18.110 - Collection and lien procedures. 
A. ?Recovery of Administrative Citation Fines and Costs. In addition to any other legal remedy, the city 
may place a lien on property owned by the citee in an amount equal to the sum of the fines 
delinquent for more than ninety (90) days, plus penalties and interest. Imposition of a lien must stem 
from a citation for the condition or use of real property, or its improvements that is owned by the 
citee. 
B. ?Lien Procedure. 
1. ?The City Manager may initiate proceedings to record a lien conforming with this code if the 
decision is not appealed. 
2. ?Before recording the lien, the department director must submit a report to the City Manager, or 
designee, stating the amount due and owing. 
3. ?The department director must then contact the City Clerk and arrange a time, date, and place 
for the City Council to consider the report and any protests or objections to it. 
4. ?The department director must serve the citee with a hearing notice not less than ten (10) days 
before the hearing date. The notice must set forth the amount of the delinquent administrative 
fine, and any penalties and interest that is due. Notice must be delivered first-class mail, 
postage prepaid, addressed to each citee's address as it appears on the last equalized 
assessment roll or supplemental roll of the county of San Bernardino, whichever is more 
current. Service by mail is effective on the date of mailing and failure of citee to actually receive 
notice does not affect its validity. 
5. ?At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council will adopt a resolution confirming, discharging, 
or modifying the lien amount. 
C. ?Recording a Lien. Within thirty (30) days following the City Council's adoption of a resolution 
imposing a lien, the Department Director will file same as a judgment lien in the San Bernardino 
County Recorder's Office. Before recordation of the lien, the city must give notice to the owner of 
record of the subject parcel in the manner required by Government Code § 38773.1(b). 
D. ?Administrative Fee. Each citee against whose property an assessment is levied pursuant to this 
chapter will also be assessed an administrative fee in an amount established by City Council 
resolution based on the costs incurred in levying the assessment. The administrative fee will be 
included in the lien amount approved by the City Council and recorded against the citee's property. 
E. ?Satisfaction of Lien. Once the City receives full payment for outstanding principal, penalties, and 
costs, the Department Director will either record a notice of satisfaction or provide the citee with a 
notice of satisfaction for recordation at the San Bernardino County Recorder's Office. This notice of 
satisfaction will cancel the city's lien. 
(Ord. 209 § 1 (part), 2008) 


Chapter 1.20 - ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS 
Sections: 


1.20.010 - Appeals to Council. 
A. ?Except when an appeals procedure is otherwise specifically set forth in this code, any person 
excepting to the denial, conditional approval, suspension, or revocation of a permit, license, or other 
approval applied for or held by him or her pursuant to any provision of this code, or to any 
administrative decision made by any official of the city, if the denial, conditional approval, 
suspension, or revocation of such permit, license, or approval, or the determination of such 
administrative decision involves the exercise of administrative discretion or personal judgment 
exercised pursuant to any provision of this code, may appeal in writing to the Council by filing with 
the City Clerk a written notice of such appeal. 
B. ?No appeal may be taken to any such administrative decision made by an official of the city pursuant 
to any provision of this code unless such decision has been first taken up with the department head 
concerned and with the City Manager, and each such official has not adjusted the matter to the 
appellant's satisfaction. Decisions of the Director of Community Development are appealable to the 
Planning Commission without being processed through the City Manager. In such a case, the party 
appealing the Community Development Director's decision shall follow the notice and time limits set 
forth herein. 
C. ?No right of appeal to the Council from any administrative decision made by an official of the city 
pursuant to any provision of this code shall exist when such decision is ministerial and thus does not 
involve the exercise of administrative discretion or personal judgment, whether the administrative 
decision involves the denial, conditional approval, suspension, or revocation of a permit, license, 
approval, or any other administrative decision. There shall be no such right of appeal with regard to 
law enforcement activities involving state law. 
(Ord. 91-05 § 2.04.100) 


1.20.020 - Notice of appealTime limitContents. 
A. ?A written notice of appeal must be filed by an aggrieved party within twenty (20) days after the date 
of the city's notice of decision from which the appeal is sought. No notice of appeal shall be acted 
upon, after such twenty (20) day period and it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to reject as untimely 
any such appeal. If a notice of decision has not been served upon the aggrieved party in writing, the 
aggrieved party may, within ten (10) days after having knowledge of such determination, demand 
service of written notice thereof, and shall have twenty (20) days following such service in which to 
file the notice of appeal. 
B. ?The notice of appeal shall set forth the following: 
1. ?The specific action appealed from; 
2. ?The specific grounds for the appeal; and 
3. ?The relief or action requested from the City Council. Any notice of appeal not containing the 
information required by this section shall be returned to the aggrieved party, hereinafter the 
"appellant"; by the City Clerk with a statement specifying those parts of the notice of appeal that 
are incomplete and indicating the manner in which they can be made complete. The appellant 
shall thereafter be allowed five days in which to perfect and refile the notice of appeal. 
C. ?Except in those instances where an appeal is filed by the City Manager or other public official 
pursuant to official duties, the written notice of appeal from the determination of an administrative 
official or from an administrative body of the city, as the case may be, shall be accompanied by an 
appeal fee established by resolution of the City Council. 
(Ord. 91-05 § 2.04.110) 


1.20.030 - AppealsHearingsNotices. 
A. ?Upon the timely filing of a notice of appeal in proper form, and together with the payment of the 
requisite appeal fee, the City Clerk shall set the appeal for hearing before the City Council at the 
earliest possible date authorized by law and shall cause written notice of the appeal, including the 
time, place, and date of the hearing on the appeal, to be given to the appellant not less than five

decision the appeal was filed. 
B. ?If two or more members of the City Council file with the City Clerk, within the time limitations set forth 
in subsection A of this section, written requests to have any decision of the Planning Commission 
submitted to the City Council for review, the City Clerk shall schedule the matter for Council 
consideration at the earliest possible date authorized by law. The filing of any such written requests 
shall be tantamount to an appeal brought pursuant to this subsection. An appeal brought pursuant to 
this subsection shall not require payment of the appeal fee as set forth in Section 1.20.020(C). 
(Ord. 91-05 § 2.04.120) 


1.20.040 - AppealsHearings. 
A. ?The City Council may limit participation at the hearing to those parties directly interested, or may 
allow participation by the public. Such public participation, however, shall only occur when the 
Council deems it necessary to further the public interest. If a hearing is ordered open to public 
participation, notice of such shall be given by publishing notice of the public participation allowance 
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city not less than five days prior to the date of such 
hearing, and by such other means as the City Council deems necessary.

the decision appealed from and may take any action which might have been legally taken in the first 
instance by the official or body from whose decision the appeal was filed. In ruling on the appeal, the 
finding and action of the Council shall be final and conclusive in the matter.

benefit or allowance. 
    "Party" means an officer or employee who has been suspended, demoted, or dismissed; a 
person whose permit, license, or other entitlement has been revoked or suspended, or whose

B. ?Judicial review of any decision of the city of Chino Hills, its City Council, or any commission, board, 
officer, or agent of the city, may be made pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
only if the petition for writ of mandate pursuant to such section is filed within the time limits specified 
in this chapter. 
C. ?Any such petition for a matter not involving a specific application or grievance shall be filed not later 
than the ninetieth (90th) day following the date on which the decision became final. Whenever a 
decision is made on a specific application, grievance, or property, any such petition shall be filed not 
later than the ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the notice to the applicant, person aggrieved, 
or property owner of the decision of the city, its Council, or any board, commission, officer, or 
employee of the city. Where there is no provision for reconsideration of the decision in any applicable 
provision of any statute, charter, or rule, for the purposes of this section the decision is final on the 
date it is made, or on the date of the notice of the decision to the applicant, grievant, or property 
owner. Where there is a specific provision for reconsideration, the decision is final for the purposes 
of this section upon the expiration of the period during which such reconsideration can be sought; 
provided that, if reconsideration is sought pursuant to any such provision, the decision is final for the 
purposes of this section on the date that reconsideration is rejected. In making a final decision, the 
city shall provide notice to the party that the time within which judicial review must be sought is 
governed by this section. 
D. ?The complete record of the proceedings shall be prepared by the city, or its commissions, boards,

A. ?Under Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00). When the estimated amount involved is five 
thousand dollars ($5,000) or less; 
B. ?Sole Source. When the commodity can be obtained from only one vendor, also known as a sole

C. ?Emergency Purchase. The City Manager may authorize the purchase of materials, supplies, 
and equipment, when an emergency is deemed to exist and it is determined that service 
involving the public health, safety, or welfare would be interrupted if the normal procedure were 
followed. A declaration of emergency as set forth in this code is conclusive evidence of such an 
event. All emergency purchases which would otherwise require formal bidding procedures 
made pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the City Council for ratification at the next 
regular City Council meeting after the purchase is authorized for which legally required meeting 
notice can be provided; 
D. ?Urgency Purchase. Urgency purchases may be made without competitive bidding when time is 
of the essence to avoid interruption of a City event. For urgency purchases, written approval 
shall be obtained prior to purchase from the City Manager or the Acting City Manager. If the City 
Manager and the Acting City Manager are unavailable, then the Assistant City Manager may 
provide written approval for an urgency purchase. Such written approval can be obtained 
through email or other means of electronic communication that can be printed for record. 
Notwithstanding the above, if every reasonable attempt to obtain written approval from the 
officials above prior to purchase has been unsuccessful, then the Department can proceed on 
oral approval, but such oral approval must be memorialized in writing to the official providing 
such oral approval, documenting the time and date of such approval, as soon as practicable. All 
urgency purchases which would otherwise require formal bidding procedures made pursuant to 
this section shall be submitted to the City Council for ratification at the next regular Council 
meeting after the purchase is authorized for which legally required meeting notice can be 
provided; 
E. ?Cooperative Purchasing. Competitive procedures need not be followed where the Purchasing 
Agent identifies a cooperative competitive bidding procedure, being prepared by and processed 
through another local, state, federal governmental, public agency, or a cooperative purchasing 
entity set up by or utilized by such governments or public agencies, where the City Council, City 
Manager or Department Director (as applicable, based upon signing authority) finds that the 
procurement process utilized by the entity is substantially similar to the provisions of this 
chapter and achieves the objectives of this chapter. Under such circumstances, the city may 
join into an existing written purchase contract obtained within the last thirty-six (36) months 
through competitive bidding process prepared by and awarded by another local, state, federal 
governmental agency, public agency, or a cooperative purchasing entity. City Council consent is 
required for such arrangements where the estimated value of the materials, supplies, or 
equipment is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or more; 
F. ?Interagency Purchases. Any agreement involving acquisition of materials, supplies, or 
equipment entered into with another governmental entity;

property" is used generically to describe City property such as but not limited to materials, supplies, 
equipment, and vehicles that are no longer needed or useable by the holding department. The 
Purchasing Agent or designee has the authority to declare item(s) surplus. Property disposal may occur 
by public auction, competitive sealed bids, or exchange or trade in for new goods. The sale or lease of 
surplus property to a governmental, public, or quasi-public agency may be without advertisement for or 
receipt of bids. Surplus property without salvage value, as determined by the Purchasing Agent, should 
be disposed of in a manner that salvages recyclable components. The City Council must direct disposal 
of surplus property with a value estimated at twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or greater based 
upon a recommendation from the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent must keep regular logs 
showing surplus property disposed of, the method of disposal, and the amounts recovered from its 
disposal and maintain records for public inspection relative to the disposal of surplus property for a period 
of time in compliance with state law and the City's records retention schedule. Upon the advance written 
approval of the City Manager, surplus property may be donated to governmental, public or quasi-public 
agencies, charities, or non-profit organizations. Proceeds from the sale of surplus property must be 
deposited into the appropriate City fund.

Contract Code, § 22050. 
D. ?Professional and Consultant Services: Agreements for professional and consultant services, 
and for other, non-public projects and contractual services may be executed without observing 
the bidding procedures provided in this chapter if the City Manager determines that the RFP

officials above prior to service has been unsuccessful, then the Department can proceed on oral 
approval, but such oral approval must be memorialized in writing to the official providing such 
oral approval, documenting the time and date of such approval, as soon as practicable. All 
urgent services which would otherwise require formal bidding procedures made pursuant to this 
section shall be submitted to the City Council for ratification at the next regular City Council 
meeting after the urgency service is authorized for which legally required meeting notice can be 
provided;

under the contract also include designing, retrofitting, or modifying the goods or equipment to 
meet the particular needs of the City. This exemption shall also include the acquisition by the

(Ord. 141 § 1 (part), 2000) 


3.32.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases shall be construed and defined as set 
forth in this section unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended:

room or rooms or portion thereof, in a hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
    "Operator" means a person who is the owner and/or manager of a hotel. When an owner operates 
the hotel through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent

liabilities as the managing agent's principal. 
    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal

or right to occupy space in the hotel according to the then effective schedule of rates for such room or 
rooms on the date or dates of such occupancy, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or 
otherwise, including all receipts, cash credits, property and services of any kind or nature, included in the

(30) consecutive calendar days or less. Portions of calendar days shall be counted as full days. A person 
so occupying a room in a hotel for more than thirty consecutive calendar days shall not be deemed to be

(Ord. 141 § 1 (part), 2000) 


3.32.030 - Tax imposed.

shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a 
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the 
transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of 
the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.

room is utilized by such employee while visiting the premises for business purposes and for 
which no rent is charged. 
C. ?Claims. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is 
collected. Each such claim shall be made under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax 
administrator.

    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the close of each calendar month, each 
operator shall file a return with the tax administrator, on forms provided by the tax administrator, stating 
the total rent and the amount of tax due for the preceding month. At the time the return is filed, the full 
amount of the tax due shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may require 
additional information to be included in returns. Returns and payments are due immediately upon 
cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be 
held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 141 § 1 (part), 2000) 


3.32.070 - Failure to collect and report taxDecisionsAppeals. 
A. ?Action by Tax Administrator. If any operator fails or refuses to collect and/or remit the tax due to the 
city and/or fails or refuses to file, within the time provided in this chapter any required report or return 
with the city, then the tax administrator shall investigate in an appropriate manner to determine an 
estimate of the tax due. The tax administrator shall make an estimate of all taxes due pursuant to 
this chapter and shall issue an order for the payment of tax ("order") determining and assessing 
against such operator the full amount of the taxes, including interest and penalties provided for by 
this chapter. The order shall briefly describe the basis for the estimate of taxes due. The tax

within the ten (10) day period, the order shall be deemed, for all purposes, final and conclusive and 
all sums set forth therein shall be immediately due and payable. 
B. ?Appeals to City Manager. If an appeal is timely filed, the City Manager shall give not less than five 
days' written notice to the operator and to any person requesting such notice, of the time and place 
of the appeal hearing, which shall be set by the City Manager. At such hearing, the operator and any 
interested person may appear and offer relevant evidence as to why the tax, interest and/or penalties 
should not be imposed as set forth in the order. After such hearing, the City Manager shall, based 
upon the evidence presented, determine the total amount of tax due, together with interest and 
penalties, if any. The City Manager shall affirm or modify the order based upon the evidence 
presented. The City Manager shall serve a copy of the written decision upon the operator and any 
other person requesting the same. The City Manager's action on an order shall be deemed final and 
conclusive and all sums set forth therein shall be immediately due and payable in the absence of a 
timely filed appeal, appealing the decision of the City Manager. 
C. ?Appeals from Decision of City Manager.

appeal shall be considered for any purpose unless the same is filed within not to exceed ten 
(10) consecutive calendar days after the service of the notice of the City Manager's action on 
the order. 
2. ?Upon receipt of a timely appeal appealing the decision of the City Manager, the City Clerk shall 
report that fact to the City Council. The City Council shall thereupon designate an independent 
hearing officer. The hearing officer shall set the matter for a de novo hearing, and give not less 
than five days' notice of the time and place of the hearing to the appealing party, the City 
Manager, and any other person requesting such notice. The hearing officer shall give any 
interested person a reasonable opportunity to present evidence relevant to any or all issues 
involved in the hearing. The hearing officer need not observe the strict rules of evidence utilized 
in a judicial proceeding, but shall observe the substance of those rules to the end that the 
matter will be resolved upon reliable evidentiary material. Upon completion of the hearing, the 
hearing officer shall decide the matter by modifying, affirming or overturning the decision 
reached by the City Manager. The hearing officer shall give notice of such decision to the 
appealing party, the City Manager and any other person requesting such notice. The decision of 
the hearing officer shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and shall be subject only to 
appropriate judicial review. 
(Ord. 141 § 1 (part), 2000) 


3.32.080 - No exemption or deduction for complimentary occupancies or services. 
A. ?Complimentary Occupancies. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a tax shall be 
imposed for the occupancy of a room in a hotel, where such occupancy is permitted by an operator 
on a complimentary basis, i.e., without charge, to any person. The amount of the tax imposed upon 
such complimentary occupancies shall be based upon the rent which would otherwise have been 
charged for a comparable room or rooms on the date or dates of such complimentary occupancy. 
B. ?Complimentary Services. Unless otherwise required by state law, the value of complimentary 
services shall not be deducted from the rent for a room and the tax imposed shall be on the full 
amount of the rent, notwithstanding the value of the complimentary service such as a complimentary

    All of the records referenced in this section, shall be maintained by each operator for a period 
not less than three years, unless the operator has received notice that the city will be auditing its 
records or the city is in the process of auditing the operator's records. If the operator has notice of an 
impending or ongoing audit, then the operator shall keep the required records for the time period 
specified in the notice until the audit has been completed and all obligations under this chapter are 
paid in full; however, under no circumstances shall the records be maintained for less than three 
years from the date the record was created. 
    An operator may apply to the tax administrator for modification of the record keeping 
requirements of this section if the operator demonstrates that the operator has an alternate

that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax and 
paid the same to the city. 
D. ?An operator may claim a refund for, or receive as a credit against taxes collected and remitted, the

in full.

to this chapter. If, as a result of any such audit, it is determined that a return required to be filed by 
such operator pursuant to Section 3.32.060 of this chapter is inaccurate and did not include and 
report the correct amount of tax due pursuant to this chapter, the operator shall forthwith pay to the 
city all taxes which are shown to be due as a result of such audit, regardless of whether the operator 
collected such taxes. 
B. ?If an audit conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section reflects that in any calendar month 
there was under-reporting of taxes due by five percent or more, which under-reporting was not 
corrected by the operator prior to the commencement of the audit, all costs associated with the audit 
shall be borne by the operator and the cost thereof shall be subject to collection as a civil debt by the

B. ?Claims for exemptions shall be made on forms provided for that purpose by the tax administrator. All 
information required on the form shall be completed by the person who claims to be exempt from 
payment of the tax. Each operator is obligated to review each claim to ensure that it is fully 
completed. When an operator submits to the tax administrator a claim of exemption which is either 
not timely filed or is incomplete, the tax administrator shall reject such claim of exemption and give 
the operator a brief statement of reasons therefor. When the rejection is based upon the form not 
being properly completed, the operator may within ten (10) consecutive calendar days from the date

Ord. No. 292, 5, 11-24-2015) 


3.40.120 - Fee adjustment. 
A. ?After July 1st of every fifth year, in connection with the annual City audit, or as soon thereafter as is 
possible, the City Council shall review the status of compliance with this chapter of each fee and the 
degree to which the fees collected pursuant to this chapter are mitigating impacts of new 
development projects. All aspects of the PFIP and subsequent studies shall be reviewed and 
updated accordingly. The review of each fee may, but is not required to be, on the same five-year 
cycle. By ordinance, and after a noticed public hearing, any of the fees may be increased or 
decreased annually to reflect changes in actual and estimated revenues and costs (including, but not 
limited to, debt service, lease payments, inflation, identification of other funding sources, acquisition 
and construction costs) of facilities financed by the fees as compared to original estimates of 
revenues and costs for facilities in the PFIP. Any such adjustments in the fees will be prospective 
only and will become effective as of the date specified in any such ordinance. 
B. ?Fees for land uses that do not fit into categories of use identified in the PFIP and subsequent studies 
shall be determined by the Community Development Director on a case-by-case basis, based upon 
the input of appropriate City staff and consultants, and based upon studies indicating the demands of 
and benefits received by the proposed uses. 
C. ?Notwithstanding the above, the TFF, WFF, SFF, SDFF, PRFF and GCFF are to be reviewed 
annually and adjusted by the price index factor set forth in the Engineering News Record's 20-City 
Average Construction Cost Index, for each January 1 of the prior year to January 1 of the current 
year, to be effective each July 1, as appropriate, beginning on July 1, 2019. 
(Ord. 128 § 6, 2000; Ord. 127 § 6, 2000; Ord. 109 § 15, 1998) 
(Ord. No. 277, § 8, 10-14-2014; Ord. No. 334, § 3, 11-27-2018) 


3.40.130 - Challenge to amount of fees. 
A. ?A developer of nonresidential land subject to a fee under this chapter may apply to the Community 
Development Director for an adjustment or waiver of that fee. The waiver of the fee shall be based 
upon the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impact on the public facilities of the 
proposed nonresidential development and either the amount of fee charged or the type of facilities 
financed. 
B. ?The application for adjustment or waiver shall be made in writing and filed with the City Clerk no later 
than ten (10) days after notification of the fee to be charged. The application shall state in detail the 
factual basis and legal theory for the claim of adjustment or waiver. 
C. ?It is the intent of this chapter that: 
1. ?The land use categories set forth in Table 1 are intended to and do incorporate a wide range of 
specific land uses; thus substantial variation must be shown in order to justify a fee adjustment; 
2. ?The Community Development Director may calculate a fee and/or require additional 
improvements where the service demand of a particular land use exceeds the standards shown 
in the definitions or used in determining the improvements needed under the 1998 Study; 
3. ?The fee categories shall be considered individually; thus it may occur that a fee adjustment or 
waiver is made in one category and not another; and 
4. ?Where improvements providing capacity for the subject parcel have already been constructed, a 
downward adjustment of the fee is not appropriate. 
D. ?The Community Development Director shall consider the application and inform applicant of his or 
her decision within sixty (60) days after the filing of the fee adjustment or waiver application. The 
decision of the Community Development Director is appealable to the City Council, pursuant to 
Chapter 2.04 of the Chino Hills Municipal Code. 
E. ?The applicant bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the 
application. The Community Development Director, with input and assistance from appropriate city 
staff, shall consider the following factors in its determination whether or not to approve a fee 
adjustment or waiver: 
1. ?The purpose and proposed use of the fee; 
2. ?The type of development; 
3. ?The relationship between the fee's use and type of development; 
4. ?The need for the improvements and the type of development; 
5. ?The amount of the fee and the portion of it attributable to the development; and 
6. ?The applicability of the 1998 Study and studies referenced in the preparation thereof to the 
particular development. The applicant must present comparable technical information to show 
that the fee is inappropriate for the particular development. 
(Ord. 109 § 16, 1998) 


3.40.140 - Time of payment of fees and liens. 
A. ?On and after the effective date of this chapter, fees shall be paid at the time of issuance of each 
building permit, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city and the applicant for such permit. 
Water facilities fees shall be paid prior to the time of connection. The general city facilities and the 
existing infrastructure fees may be paid at issuance of building permits, or may be paid at the close 
of escrow for each residential unit or at the time of final inspection, whichever occurs first, pursuant 
to procedures promulgated by the Community Development Director. The Community Development 
Director may require, among other things, an agreement as contemplated by Government Code 
Section 66007, the costs associated therewith to be borne by the applicant. 
B. ?Fees shall be subject to the existing ordinance in effect at the time each fee is due. Any late fees 
shall bear interest at the rate earned by city pooled funds in its treasury from the date the fees were 
due, calculated per month from the date of delinquency, plus all costs associated with collections of 
such fees. 
C. ?An applicant for a building permit shall also be required to pay the outstanding principal of any and 
all assessment district liens on the property to be developed for Assessment Districts 94-1 and 95-1. 
Such payment shall be made before the payment of any fees and shall constitute a credit against the 
EIF, as set forth in Section 3.40.180 of this chapter. If an applicant possesses credits in excess of 
the EIF owed, the applicant shall still be required to pay to the city the balance of the outstanding lien 
at the time the EIF is due pursuant to Section 17 herein. Reimbursement of any amounts then owed 
to the applicant shall be reimbursed to the applicant as set forth in Section 21, herein. 
D. ?At the city's sole discretion, and with the approval of the City Council on a case by case basis, 
developers of new construction within Assessment Districts 94-1 and 95-1 shall be allowed to 
continue or pass-through any Assessment District 94-1 or 95-1 lien on their property, rather than be 
required to retire the balance of any such lien at the time the EIF is due pursuant to this section. Any 
such authorized pass-through shall constitute a credit towards the EIF as set forth in Section 
3.40.180 of this chapter, provided that in no event may the credit received from an authorized pass-
through exceed the amount of EIF owed by the applicant. 
(Ord. 111 § 3, 1998; Ord. 110 § 3, 1998; Ord. 109 § 17, 1998) 


3.40.150 - Method of payment. 
    All fees shall be paid in cash, check, or by credit granted pursuant to Section 3.40.180 of this 
chapter, titled Credits/Reimbursements. Such fees shall be paid in their entirety in accordance with 
Section 3.40.140 of this chapter, titled Time of Payment. Warrants/checks shall be made payable to the 
city. 
(Ord. 109 § 18, 1998) 


3.40.160 - Delinquency. 
    Where there is delinquency in payment of the fees as required in this chapter, the city may initiate 
foreclosure proceedings in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and in any and all 
applicable state and local laws. If a sale or foreclosure is commenced, notice of the pendency of such 
sale or foreclosure shall be recorded with the County's Recorder not later than ten (10) days after 
commencing an action or proceeding in any court to foreclose. The notice of pendency shall state that the 
city has commenced a sale or foreclosure, as the case may be, and shall refer to and identify such sale or 
foreclosure, and shall describe the property affected by such foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to 
recover the cost of recordation of any such notice, order or judgment authorizing or providing for such 
sale or foreclosure, and penalties which are allowed by this chapter. The provisions of this section shall 
not be the exclusive remedies available to the city with regard to delinquent fees. 
(Ord. 109 § 19, 1998) 


3.40.170 - Fee funds. 
A. ?All fees collected shall be deposited into fee funds by category, established by the City Finance 
Director. For example, all traffic facilities fees collected shall be deposited into a traffic facilities fee 
fund established by the City Finance Director. Amounts in such funds shall be expended solely by 
category for facilities, project management, administrative costs, engineering, leasing, acquisition, 
legal costs, improvement or construction (including indebtedness incurred for such purposes) for 
facilities which have been found to benefit properties subject to such fees and for reimbursements 
pursuant to Section 3.40.180 of this section, and approved audited costs. For example, costs of 
traffic facilities, as identified in the 1998 Study, shall be paid solely from traffic facilities fees 
collected. 
B. ?Any fees remaining unexpended or uncommitted in the fee accounts five years after its deposit and 
not specified for a particular use shall be refunded to the then current record owner or owners of the 
property. 
(Ord. 109 § 20, 1998) 


3.40.180 - Credits/Reimbursements. 
A. ?Subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, fee credits/reimbursements 
may be granted to developers for facilities which are financed or constructed by property owners or 
developers in advance of the city's construction program provided that: 
1. ?The granting of such credits/reimbursements conforms to this chapter and the 1998 Study as 
those may be amended from time to time; and 
2. ?A written agreement for construction of infrastructure, between the city and such owner or 
developer must be approved in advance of such construction pursuant to Section 3.40.190 of 
this chapter; and 
3. ?Credits/reimbursements for a facility within a certain category (for example, parks and recreation 
facilities) can only come from the fees collected in that same category (parks and recreation 
facilities fees). 
B. ?The amount of the credits/reimbursements granted shall be determined by an estimate of the costs 
of such facilities, adjusted after completion by an audit of such costs. The cost of the audit shall be 
borne by the developer. The city shall review and determine the actual costs allowable. No 
credits/reimbursements shall be given for the cost of improvements not defined in this chapter as 
"Facilities." Credits/reimbursements shall not exceed the lesser of the costs of facilities as set forth in 
the 1998 Study used to establish the fees for this chapter or the actual audited costs of the facilities. 
C. ?At the time fees are due, pursuant to Section 3.40.140 of this chapter, a maximum of ninety (90) 
percent of fees owed may be offset by credits against such fees. At least ten (10) percent of all fees 
owed must be paid at the time fees are due. To the extent that any applicant for a building permit has 
accrued credits in excess of ninety (90) percent of the fees owed, those credits, shall be reimbursed 
from the fee funds as set forth in this section. 
D. ?Credits against EIF may be awarded pursuant to written agreements entered into prior to adoption of 
this chapter. Any credits/reimbursements awarded by virtue of such agreements and identified for 
use against the facilities development fee, the facilities benefit assessment, the water capital 
connection fees, the sewer capital connection fees as such fees existed prior to the adoption of this 
chapter shall apply against the EIF only. Additionally, the principal portion of all Assessment District 
94-1 and 95-I installment payments and the interest portion of any such payments made prior to 
1995 shall constitute a credit against the EIF only. 
E. ?Parks and Recreation Fee credits may also be granted to developers up to twenty-five (25) percent 
against PRFF for private recreational facilities constructed, provided the city of Chino Hills Parks and 
Recreation Commission finds that it is in the public interest to do so, and provided that the following 
standards are met: 
1. ?That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the 
zoning, land use district, and building regulations shall not be included in the computation of 
such private recreational facilities; and 
2. ?That the private ownership and maintenance of the private recreational facilities is adequately 
provided for by written agreement; and 
3. ?That the use of the private recreational facilities is restricted for park and recreational purposes 
by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of the property 
within the tract; and 
4. ?That the proposed private recreational facilities are in substantial accordance with the provisions 
of the city's General Plan and Park Master Plan and are approved by the Park and Recreation 
Commission; and 
5. ?That the private recreational facilities include one or more of the following active recreational 
elements: (a) open spaces dedicated to the active recreational pursuits, such as soccer, golf, 
baseball, softball, and football; (b) basketball courts, tennis courts, badminton courts, 
shuffleboard courts or similar hard-surfaced areas, and volleyball courts, especially designed 
and exclusively used for court games; and (c) recreational swimming pools and other swimming 
areas. 
F. ?From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, credits/reimbursements 
shall be given in stated dollar amounts only. 
G. ?Excess credits (credits in excess of ninety (90) percent of fees owed) shall be reimbursed only after 
sufficient revenues are available in the appropriate fee account for such reimbursement, as 
determined by the city, and shall generally be paid first to the oldest outstanding excess credit 
holder. With respect to excess credits to be reimbursed from the EIF fund, priority of repayment shall 
be as follows: 
1. ?Reimbursement shall be made first to those parties the city is contractually obligated to 
reimburse by a date certain; 
2. ?Reimbursement shall be made during the 1998-99 fiscal year to all payors of FDF and FBA 
revolving fees, which were assessed prior to 1995, who have five DUs or less of revolving fee 
reimbursement due, to the extent that such payment does not interfere with the obligations 
identified in subsection (G)(1) of this section; 
3. ?Thereafter, eighty (80) percent of EIF revenues collected in cash, less administrative expenses, 
shall be paid on a first paid, first reimbursed basis to all other payors of FDF and FBA revolving 
fees, to the extent that such payment does not interfere with the obligations identified in

Sections:

mechanism for ensuring that fees adopted by the city for services rendered do not exceed the 
reasonable estimated cost for providing the services for which the fees are charged. 
B. ?The adoption of this chapter is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (Public 
Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.), because it approves and sets forth a procedure for 
determining fees for the purpose of meeting the operating expenses of city departments, as set 
forth in Public Resources Code Section 21080 (b)(8)(1). 
C. ?Pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, it is the intent of the City Council to 
require the ascertainment and recovery of costs reasonably borne from fees and charges levied 
therefor in providing the regulation, products or services hereinafter enumerated in this chapter.

4. ?No adult-oriented business shall be operated in any manner that permits the observation of any 
material or activities depicting, describing, or relating to specified sexual activities or specified 
anatomical areas from any public way or from any location outside the building or area of such 
establishment. This provision shall apply to any display, decoration, sign, show window, or other

5. ?No alcoholic beverages shall be served, consumed, or sold on the premises of an adult-oriented 
business. 
6. ?Any adult-oriented business which is also an adult motion picture arcade shall comply with the 
following provisions:

the products available on display for purchaser viewing shall not be allowed to stand idly by 
in the vicinity of any such video booths, or remain in the common area of such business, 
other than the restrooms. Signs prohibiting loitering shall be posted in prominent places in 
and near the video booths. 
f. ?The floors, seats, walls, and other interior portions of all video booths shall be maintained 
clean and free from waste and bodily secretions. Presence of human excrement, urine,

suspension or revocation of the owner's adult-oriented business permit.

a. ?No person shall perform adult live entertainment or display specified anatomical areas for 
patrons of an adult-oriented business except upon a permanently fixed stage at least 
eighteen (18) inches above the level of the floor, and which is separated by a distance of at 
least four feet horizontally from the nearest area occupied by patrons. No patron shall be 
permitted within four feet of the stage while the stage is occupied by an entertainer. No on-
stage entertainer or on-stage adult cabaret dancer shall have physical contact with any 
patron, and no patron shall have physical contact with any on-stage entertainer or on-stage 
adult cabaret dancer. 
b. ?The adult-oriented business shall provide separate dressing room facilities for entertainers 
which are exclusively dedicated to the entertainers' use. 
c. ?The adult-oriented business shall provide an entrance/exit for entertainers which is 
separate from the entrance/exit used by patrons. 
d. ?The adult-oriented business shall provide access for entertainers between the stage and 
the dressing rooms which is completely separated from the patrons. If such separate 
access is not physically feasible, the adult-oriented business shall provide a minimum 
three-foot-wide walk aisle for entertainers between the dressing room area and the stage, 
with a railing, fence, or other barrier separating the patrons and the entertainers capable of 
(and which actually results in) preventing any physical contact between patrons and 
entertainers. 
e. ?As to off-stage performances, no entertainer shall perform adult live entertainment 
characterized by the exposure of specified anatomical areas or engaging in specified 
sexual activities off-stage. As to an adult cabaret dancer performing off-stage, a distance of 
at least two feet shall be maintained between the adult cabaret dancer and patron(s) at all 
times. As to off-stage performances, no adult cabaret dancer shall have physical contact 
with any patron, and no patron shall have physical contact with any adult cabaret dancer 
while the adult cabaret dancer is performing on the premises. This prohibition does not 
extend to incidental touching. 
f. ?In addition, while on the premises, no entertainer or adult cabaret dancer shall have 
physical contact with a patron, and no patron shall have physical contact with an 
entertainer or adult cabaret dancer, which physical contact involves the touching of the 
clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, cleft of the buttocks, perineum, anal 
region, or female breast with any part or area of any other person's body either before or 
after any live entertainment by such entertainer or adult cabaret dancer. Patrons shall be 
advised of the no-touching requirements by signs and, if necessary, by employees, 
entertainers, or adult cabaret dancers of the establishment. 
g. ?Fixed rail(s) at least thirty-six (36) inches in height shall be maintained, establishing the 
separations between entertainers and patrons required by this subsection. 
h. ?No patron shall directly pay or give any gratuity to any entertainer or adult cabaret dancers, 
and no entertainer or adult cabaret dancers shall solicit any pay or gratuity from any 
patron. If patrons wish to pay or tip entertainers or adult cabaret dancers, payment or tips 
may be placed in receptacles. Patrons shall not throw moneys to entertainers or adult 
cabaret dancers, hand moneys directly to entertainers or adult cabaret dancers, place 
moneys in the entertainers' or adult cabaret dancers' costumes, or otherwise throw moneys 
on the stage. Patrons shall be advised of these tipping and gratuity requirements by signs 
conspicuously placed on the premises. If necessary, patrons shall also be advised of the 
tipping and gratuity requirements by employees or independent contractors of the adult 
business. 
i. ?No owner or operator of an adult-oriented business shall permit any person on the premises 
of the adult-oriented business to engage in a live showing of the human male or female 
genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully opaque coverage, and/or the female 
breast with less than a fully opaque coverage over any part of the nipple or areola. This 
provision may not be complied with by applying an opaque covering simulating the 
appearance of the specified anatomical areas required to be covered. 
j. ?All employees of adult-oriented businesses which offer adult live entertainment, other than 
performers while performing on the permanently fixed stage, shall, at a minimum while on 
or about the licensed premises, wear an opaque covering which covers their specified 
anatomical areas.

and safety, based upon the following standards: 
a. ?Adult-oriented businesses featuring live entertainment shall provide at least one security 
guard at all times while the business is open. If the occupancy limit of the premises is 
greater than thirty-five (35) persons, an additional security guard shall be on duty. 
b. ?Security guards for other adult-oriented businesses may be required if it is determined by 
the Police Chief that their presence is necessary in order to prevent any of the conduct 
listed in this chapter from occurring on the premises. 
c. ?Security guard(s) shall be charged with preventing violations of law and enforcing 
compliance by patrons of the requirements of these regulations. Security guards shall be 
uniformed in such a manner so as to be readily identifiable as a security guard by the 
public and shall be duly licensed as a security guard as required by applicable provisions 
of state law. No security guard required pursuant to this subsection shall act as a door 
person, ticket seller, ticket taker, admittance person, or sole occupant of the manager's 
station while acting as a security guard. 
10. ?Every adult-oriented business that provides live entertainment or entertainers depicting 
specified anatomical areas or involving in specified sexual activities must maintain a register of 
all persons so performing on the premises. The register shall contain the following information:

hours by any police officer or health officer of the city of Chino Hills. The above information shall

or cessation of performance at the premises. 
11. ?No owner or operator of any adult-oriented business shall have been convicted within the past 
three years of any of the following offenses or convicted of an offense without the state of 
California that would have constituted any of the following offenses if committed within the state 
of California: Sections 243.4, 261, 266(a) through (j), inclusive, 267, 314, 315, 316, 318, or 
subdivisions (a), (b), and (d) of Section 647 of the California Penal Code; any offense requiring 
registration under provisions of either Section 290 of the California Penal Code or Section 
11590 of the California Health and Safety Code; or any felony offense involving the possession, 
possession for sale, sale, transportation, furnishing, or giving away of a controlled substance 
specified in Section 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057, or 11058 of the California Health and Safety

solicit, or shall permit personal solicitation of, motorists or pedestrians in the vicinity of the adult-
oriented business.

5.08.070 - Permit requirementsEffect of noncompliance. 
    The requirements described in Section 5.08.060 of this chapter shall be deemed conditions of an 
adult-oriented business permit approval, and failure to comply with every such applicable requirement 
shall be grounds for revocation of the permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. 184 § 2 (part), 2005) 


5.08.080 - Permit duration. 
    An adult-oriented business permit shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issuance. 
(Ord. 184 § 2 (part), 2005) 


5.08.090 - Permit renewal. 
    An adult-oriented business permit shall be renewed on a year-to-year basis, provided that the 
permittee and the adult-oriented business continue to meet all applicable requirements set forth in this 
chapter. A request for permit renewal must be accompanied by an adult-oriented business permit 
application, completed in full detail with current information. The application and appropriate fee must be 
received by the city at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the expiration of the existing permit. A 
request for a permit renewal shall be processed in the same manner as the original application. 
(Ord. 184 § 2 (part), 2005) 


5.08.100 - Permit transferability. 
    No adult-oriented business permit shall be sold, transferred, or assigned, by any permittee or by 
operation of law, to any other person unless and until the transferee obtains an amendment to the permit 
from the City Manager stating that the transferee is now the permittee. Such an amendment may be 
obtained only if the transferee files an application with the City Manager in accordance with Section 
5.08.040 of this chapter (including payment of the applicable application fee), and the City Manager 
determines in accordance with Section 5.08.050 of this chapter that the transferee would be entitled to 
the issuance of an original permit. Without such amendment to the permit, any other purported sale, 
transfer, or assignment or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a 
voluntary surrender of the permit and the permit shall be thereafter null and void. An adult-oriented 
business permit held by a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company is subject to the same rules 
of transferability as contained in this section. An adult-oriented business permit shall be valid only for the 
exact location specified in the permit. 
(Ord. 184 § 2 (part), 2005) 


5.08.110 - Enforcement and revocation. 
A. ?Inspections. Any and all investigating officials of the city shall have the right to enter the premises of 
an adult-oriented business from time to time during regular business hours to make reasonable 
inspections, to observe and enforce compliance with building, fire, electrical, plumbing, or health 
regulations, and to ascertain whether there is compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B. ?Revocation Grounds. The City Manager may revoke an adult-oriented business permit when: 
1. ?Any of the applicable requirements of this chapter ceases to be satisfied; or 
2. ?The application is discovered to contain incorrect, false, or misleading information; or 
3. ?An owner is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor occurring upon, or relating to the premises or 
lot upon which the adult-oriented business is located, which offense is one of those listed in 
Section 5.08.060(B)(11) of this chapter; or 
4. ?Any operator, employee, agent, or contractor of the permittee is convicted on two or more 
occasions within a twelve (12) month period of a felony or misdemeanor occurring upon, or 
relating to, the premises or lot upon which the adult-oriented business is located, which offense 
is one of those listed in Section 5.08.060(B)(11) of this chapter; or 
5. ?The permittee, operator, or any employee, agent, or contractor has knowingly allowed 
prostitution, or solicitation for prostitution, on the premises; or

premises to be used as a place where a controlled substance has been illegally consumed, 
sold, or exchanged; or 
7. ?The adult-oriented business has been operated in violation of any of the requirements of this 
chapter; and 
a. ?If the violation is of a continuous nature, the business continues to be operated in violation 
of such provision for more than ten (10) days following the date written notice of such 
violation is mailed or delivered to the owner; or 
b. ?If the violation is of a noncontinuous nature, two or more additional violations of the same 
provision, or four or more violations of any other of the provisions of this chapter occur

shall furnish written notice of the proposed revocation to the permittee. Such notice shall summarize 
the principal reasons for the proposed revocation and shall state that the revocation shall become 
effective on the twentieth (20th) day after the notice was deposited in the U.S. mail, unless the 
permittee files an appeal in accordance with Section 5.08.120 of this chapter. The notice shall be 
delivered both by posting the notice at the location of the adult-oriented business and by sending the 
same by certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to the permittee as that name 
and address appears on the permit. 
(Ord. 184 § 2 (part), 2005) 


5.08.120 - Appeals. 
A. ?In the event the City Manager gives notice of an intended revocation of a permit, the permittee may 
appeal the City's Manager's decision to the City Council by filing with the City Clerk a complete 
notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days from the date notice of such intended revocation is mailed to 
the permittee. To be deemed complete, the appeal shall be in writing, shall be signed under penalty

her designee, determines that the application will likely be denied, then the City Manager, or his or her 
designee, shall cause an administrative hearing to be held within ten (10) days of the date on which the

Chapter 5.32 - MINOR-ORIENTED BUSINESS LICENSES 
Sections: 


5.32.010 - Findings. 
    In adopting the provisions of this chapter, the City Council finds each of the following: 
A. ?That certain businesses by the nature of their business cater to and attract children who may 
spend long hours in the business establishment without the presence of their parents or 
guardians or other adult customers; 
B. ?That children spending long hours in such establishments are at risk of harm or danger and 
may be unable to effectively communicate or appreciate that harm or danger; 
C. ?That such business establishments by complying with certain regulations would afford a more 
safe and healthy environment for children; 
D. ?That persons who have been recently convicted of certain specified criminal acts can pose a 
bad influence on the character development of children and a possible physical threat when 
associating with minors for a substantial period of time without other responsible adults being 
present; 
E. ?That some public and private entities involved in working solely with children when the children 
are unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians require a licensing or background check 
of their employees to help ensure the safety of children and this chapter is a further effort in that 
regard; 
F. ?That individuals owning and working at minor-oriented businesses should be licensed to prevent 
those who have been recently convicted of specified criminal acts which are of particular danger 
to children from exposing the children of Chino Hills to such harm or danger; and 
G. ?That enactment of this licensing program is necessary to protect the public health, safety, or 
welfare because children are naturally attracted to such business establishments.

depend upon the application and the granting of the franchise; 
4. ?A copy of any agreement covering the franchise area, if existing between the applicant and the 
local telephone and/or electric utilities providing for the use of any facilities of the utility including 
but not limited to poles, lines or conduits; and 
5. ?Any other details, statements, information or references pertinent to the subject matter of such 
application which shall be required or requested by the City Council in any applicable request 
for proposal, or by any applicable provision of law. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.120 - Selection of grantee. 
A. ?Upon receipt of an application for a franchise, the City Manager shall cause to be prepared a report, 
including recommendations respecting such application, which shall be filed with the City Council, 
each applicant, and existing grantees. 
B. ?The city may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine the ability of an applicant 
to perform under a franchise. The applicant shall timely furnish to the city all such information and 
data for as the city may request. Failure to provide any such information shall be reason for rejection 
of any application. 
C. ?If, upon receiving the City Manager's report, the City Council decides to further consider any 
application, it shall pass a resolution setting a public hearing for such consideration fixing and setting 
forth a day, hour, and place certain when and where any persons having any interest therein or who 
wish to file objections may file written comments and appear before the City Council and be heard, 
and directing the City Clerk to publish said resolution at least once within ten (10) days of the 
passage thereof in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. 
D. ?In making any determination as to an application for a new franchise, the city may consider any and 
all factors which effect the interests of the community including, but not limited to, the quality of the 
cable service proposed, the areas to be served, the rates to be charged, the amount of franchise fee 
to be generated, the experience, character, background, performance history and financial 
responsibility of an applicant (and its management and owners), the technical performance and 
quality of equipment, the applicant's willingness and ability to meet construction and physical 
requirements (and all other limitations and requirements pertaining to the franchise), and all other 
matters deemed pertinent by the city for safeguarding the interests of the city and the public. 
E. ?At the time set for the hearing, or at any adjournment thereof, the City Council shall proceed to hear 
all comments. Thereafter, the City Council shall make one of the following determinations: 
1. ?That such application be denied; or 
2. ?That a franchise be granted on specified terms and conditions. 
F. ?Any decision of the City Council concerning award of a franchise pursuant to this chapter shall be 
final. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.130 - Multiple franchises. 
A. ?The city may at its sole discretion limit the number of franchises granted at any one time based upon 
its consideration of all appropriate criteria which shall including but not be limited to the following: 
1. ?The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the facilities of any proposed additional 
cable systems; 
2. ?The advantages and disadvantages that may result from additional cable system competition; 
B. ?The city may require that any grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and any 
associated costs if, in the city's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any area do not feasibly and 
reasonably accommodate the additional cables, machinery, equipment, or other items contemplated 
in connection with the construction, maintenance and operation of a proposed new cable system. In 
addition, grantee shall comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding pole attachments. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.140 - Franchise application processing costs. 
A. ?In connection with any application for a new franchise, a franchise renewal or a franchise transfer, 
each applicant shall pay a filing fee equal to the city's actual costs in processing and analyzing the 
application. Each applicant shall furnish with its proposal a deposit toward the filing fee in the amount 
of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), by certified or cashier's check made payable to the city. No 
application shall be considered without receipt of said deposit. The city may draw funds from the 
deposit as costs are incurred. If the city's actual costs in processing and analyzing the application 
are less than the amount of the deposit, any remaining funds from the deposit shall be refunded to 
the applicant within sixty (60) days after final approval or denial of their application. In the event that 
the deposit is less than the city's actual costs, grantee shall restore the deposit to the original amount 
within thirty (30) days after written notice from the city that an amount has been withdrawn. 
B. ?Any application processing or analysis costs are exclusive of grantee's obligation to pay other costs 
and fees required by this chapter, the franchise agreement or the franchise, including without 
limitation construction inspection fees, permit fees, and franchise fees. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.150 - Franchise fee. 
A. ?As compensation for any franchise granted, and in consideration of permission to use the public 
right-of-way in the operation of its cable system, and because the city will incur costs (other than 
application fees) in regulating and administering the franchise, grantee shall pay to the city a 
franchise fee in the amount equal to five percent of grantee's gross revenues, or such other amount 
as the City Council may set by resolution. 
B. ?The franchise fee assessed shall be paid quarterly, to be received by the City Treasurer not later 
than forty-five (45) days after the close of each quarter of grantee's fiscal year. 
C. ?On a quarterly basis, grantee shall provide the city a complete and accurate statement verified by a 
financial officer of grantee indicating gross revenues for said month, listing every revenue source, 
and depicting gross revenue computations. 
D. ?On an annual basis, grantee shall, if requested by the city in accordance with Section 5.52.710, file a 
complete and accurate statement certified by grantee's chief financial officer, indicating all gross 
revenues for said year, listing every revenue source, and depicting gross revenue computations. If 
the city has any concerns or issues relating to contents of said report, the city shall have sixty (60) 
days to notify grantee and request additional information. Grantee shall have sixty (60) days to 
provide additional input and data to resolve any concerns or issues to the city's satisfaction. 
Thereafter, the city may, at its sole discretion, request that said statement be certified by an 
independent certified public accountant, at grantee's sole cost; provided, however, that any such 
request shall be made within sixty (60) days after grantee's response is received. 
E. ?At any time during the term of a franchise, the city shall have the right to conduct, or require grantee 
to obtain, an independent audit by certified public accountants of any and all records of grantee that 
are related to gross revenue reports or computations. Grantee shall cooperate with any such audit 
making readily available any and all information requested by the city relating to the audit. Grantee 
shall pay all costs of said audits, including all reasonable costs incurred by the city for any technical 
assistance deemed necessary by the city for obtaining independent verification of technical 
compliance with all franchise standards and this code. The certified public accountants shall be 
required to certify in the audit that the grantee is in compliance with this code and any franchise 
agreement. Grantee shall maintain in a readily accessible place all such records for a minimum of 
four years after any payment period that such record pertains to. This right shall be in addition to 
city's right to conduct any other audit. 
F. ?In the event that any franchise fee payment is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore 
specified, interest shall be charged monthly at a monthly rate of one and one-half percent. In 
addition, if any franchise fee is not paid in full within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the 
city as to the delinquency of such payment, a late fee in amount of five percent of the delinquent 
amount shall be assessed. 
G. ?In the event grantee claims to have overpaid by more than five percent the amount of franchise fee 
actually due during any given quarter, it shall file an application with the city within one year after 
said payment was made. The failure to timely and properly make such claim as required herein shall 
constitute a waiver by grantee of any right to such claimed overpayment, whether by refund, offset, 
credit or any other accommodation. All such applications shall state the amount of claimed 
overpayment, the reason for the claimed overpayment, and sufficient documentation to allow the city 
to verify grantee's claim. Upon request by the city, grantee shall provide any further information that 
is deemed by the city to be relevant to said claim. All such applications shall be considered by the 
City Council, and the City Council's decision with respect to such applications shall be final. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.160 - Breach of franchiseGrounds for assessment of penalties and franchise revocation. 
A. ?In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city under this chapter or otherwise, the city 
reserves the right to terminate any franchise and all rights and privileges of grantee, or assess 
damages or penalties against grantee, in the event of any material breach of its terms and 
conditions. A material breach by grantee shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1. ?Violation of any material provision of this chapter, the franchise agreement or any material rule, 
order, regulation or directive issued in connection with the franchise; 
2. ?Evasion of any material provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, or the practice of 
fraud or deceit upon the city, its subscribers or customers; 
3. ?Material misrepresentation of fact in an application for a new franchise, renewal or transfer of a 
franchise, whether by act or omission; 
4. ?Failure to pay any franchise fee when said payment is due; 
5. ?Failure to restore cable service after ninety-six (96) consecutive hours of interrupted cable 
service, except in the event that the city approves in writing a longer period of interruption after 
making a determination that there exists just cause for such longer period of interruption; 
6. ?Failure to provide at least eighty (80) percent of subscribed cable services over all or a 
substantial portion of the cable system for a period of five days; 
7. ?Failure to substantially meet customer service standards established in the franchise over a 
three-month period of time; 
8. ?Failure to initiate or complete scheduled system construction or reconstruction within the time 
set forth in the franchise, unless the City Council expressly approves the delay by motion or 
resolution, due to the occurrence of conditions beyond grantee's control; 
9. ?Failure to provide or maintain in full force and effect any of the liability and indemnification 
coverage, letter of credit or bonds required by the franchise; 
10. ?Violation of orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over grantee relative to 
the franchise; 
11. ?Failure to provide, upon written request, data, documents, reports or information; and 
12. ?Failure to pay debts and obligations as they mature in accordance with normal business 
practices; assignment of grantee or its assets for the benefit of its creditors; dissolution, 
liquidation or ceasing to conduct business; application by grantee for (or consent to) the 
appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator; or the sale of all or substantially all of grantee's 
assets. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.170 - Procedure for adjudication of breaches of the franchise. 
A. ?Prior to imposing any sanction or penalty upon grantee, including termination of the franchise, the 
City Council, the City Manager, or their designee, shall demand in writing that grantee cure said 
breach within a specified period, which period shall not be less than thirty (30) days following 
notification. Only fifteen (15) days notice shall be required in the case of failure to pay moneys due. 
In addition, the city may, in an emergency, prescribe a notice less than thirty (30) days consistent 
with the nature of the emergency. 
B. ?Should grantee fail to provide sufficient written proof within the specified cure period that corrective 
action has been taken, or that corrective action is being actively and expeditiously pursued by 
grantee, then the city may, in its sole discretion, elect to either place the issue of termination or other 
penalty before the City Council or refer said issue to an appropriate hearing officer for his/her 
determination. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.180 - City council hearing procedures. 
A. ?The City Council may hold a public meeting to determine whether grantee materially breached the 
franchise and the appropriate penalty to be imposed, if any, as a result of such breach. The city shall 
cause to be served upon grantee, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such meeting, written 
notice of any intent to terminate the franchise and the time and place of the meeting. Grantee may 
appear at such meeting and present such evidence, orally or in documented form, that it deems 
relevant and appropriate to the Council's deliberations. Based on the evidence presented at the 
meeting, the City Council shall determine in its discretion whether or not a material breach occurred 
and whether to terminate the franchise or take other appropriate action. 
B. ?Should the City Council find that there has been a material breach of the franchise, but that 
termination of the franchise is inappropriate, then the Council may asses and levy monetary 
penalties against grantee. This penalty provision is separate and apart from the city's right to enforce 
the provisions of the construction and performance bonds and liquidated damages. 
C. ?The city shall cause grantee to be served with written notice of any action taken by the City Council 
following such public hearing. The decision of the City Council as to such matters shall be final. 
D. ?Nothing herein is intended to limit the City Council's right to make other determinations which are 
reasonably related to the franchise, or to seek any other appropriate relief to which the city may be 
entitled, at law or equity, as a result of any breach by grantee of its obligations under the franchise. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.190 - Hearing officer procedures. 
A. ?The City Manager may, at his or her sole discretion, refer to a hearing officer any controversy or 
claim arising out of or relating to the franchise or its existence, construction, interpretation, 
performance, enforcement, operation, breach, continuance or termination. Such hearing proceedings 
shall be initiated by the City Manager by written notice to grantee. 
B. ?The Hearing Officer shall be a retired California Superior Court Judge, retired Appellate Court Judge, 
retired Federal Court Judge, or other qualified, experienced, and reasonably impartial officer, and 
shall be selected by the City Manager at his or her sole discretion. 
C. ?The hearing officer shall commence a hearing within ninety (90) days of his or her selection unless 
the parties and the hearing officer otherwise agree in writing. 
D. ?Any party to the hearing may issue to the other party a request for production of documents, and/or 
a total of not more than twenty-five (25) written interrogatories, and shall be provided with an 
appropriate response thereto, in the manner and form prescribed by California Code of Civil 
Procedure Sections 2030 and 2031. Any dispute that is not resolved after a good faith attempt to 
"meet and confer" shall be submitted to the hearing officer for resolution, and the hearing officer's 
determinations as to such matter (which may include imposition of appropriate sanctions) shall be 
final. Neither party shall be required to make any other form of discovery available to the other party. 
E. ?The hearing officer shall be vested with quasi-judicial authority, and shall be empowered to (1) order 
grantee to undertake remedial action to cure any breach of its obligations under its franchise, (2) 
assess liquidated damages and/or levy a penalty upon grantee in accordance with the terms of this 
chapter and the franchise agreement, (3) determine that grantee has not violated any of its 
obligations under its franchise and/or (4) terminate the franchise. The hearing officer shall enter 
conclusions of law and findings of fact which must be supported by a preponderance of the 
evidence. 
F. ?Except as may be apportioned by the hearing officer in his or her discretion, each party shall bear 
one-half of the fees and expenses of the hearing officer, together with any other expenses of the 
hearing proceedings incurred or approved by the hearing officer. Each party shall bear its own 
witness and attorneys' fees or other expenses. 
G. ?Failure of grantee to fully and promptly comply with an order of a hearing officer shall be deemed a 
material breach of the franchise. 
H. ?The decision of the hearing officer shall be final and subject to judicial review pursuant to California 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.200 - Force majeureGrantee's inability to perform. 
    In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations of the franchise is 
prevented by any cause beyond grantee's reasonable control, such inability to perform shall be deemed 
to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided grantee has 
notified the city in writing within thirty (30) days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. In 
such an instance, grantee shall continue to use its best efforts to perform its obligations, cure any breach 
and offer appropriate substitute performance where applicable. For the purpose of this section, causes or 
events not within the control of grantee shall include, but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, sabotage, 
riots or civil disturbances, epidemic, labor disputes, shortage of labor, freight embargoes, shortages or 
unavailability of materials and supplies, explosion, natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, 
landslides and fires, rationing, and power or communications failures, but shall not include financial 
inability of grantee to perform or failure of grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other 
governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely 
to the acts or omissions of grantee. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.210 - Penalties for breach of the franchise. 
    The City Council or hearing officer may impose the following penalties for any breach of the 
franchise, including any breach of subscriber service standards: 
A. ?Up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each day of each material breach, or such other 
amount provided in the franchise agreement; 
B. ?For a second material breach of the same nature occurring within twelve (12) months where a 
fine or penalty was previously assessed, up to twice the maximum penalty allowed for the first 
such breach; 
C. ?For a third or further material breach of the same nature occurring within twelve (12) months of 
the first such breach, where a fine or penalty was previously assessed, up to four times the 
maximum penalty allowed for the first such breach. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.220 - Liquidated damages. 
A. ?By acceptance of the franchise granted by the city, grantee understands and agrees that failure to 
timely comply with any performance requirements as stipulated in this chapter and the franchise 
agreement deemed material by the city will result in damage to the city, and that it is and will be 
impractical to determine the actual amount of such damage in the event of delay or nonperformance; 
the franchise agreement shall include provisions for liquidated damages to be paid by grantee, in 
amounts set forth in the franchise agreement and chargeable to any security, including without 
limitation a construction bond, performance bond or letter of credit, for any breach of the franchise, 
including but not limited to any of the grounds for material breach referred to in Section 5.52.160 of 
this chapter. 
B. ?If the City Manager, following prior reasonable notice to grantee to cure any problem that might 
result in liquidated damages, concludes that grantee is in fact liable for liquidated damages, he or 
she shall cause to be issued to grantee by certified mail a Notice of Intent to Assess Liquidated 
Damages. The notice shall set forth the basis of the assessment, and shall inform grantee that 
liquidated damages will be assessed from the date of the notice unless the assessment notice is 
appealed for hearing before the City Council, and the City Council rules that: (1) there was no 
violation, (2) the violation has been corrected, or (3) an extension of time or other relief should be 
granted in lieu of liquidated damages. 
C. ?If grantee desires a hearing before the City Council, then grantee shall send a written Notice of 
Appeal by certified mail to the City Manager within ten (10) days of the date on which the city sent 
the Notice of Intention to Assess Liquidated Damages. The hearing on grantee's appeal shall be 
within thirty (30) days of the date on which the city mailed the Notice of Intention to Assess 
Liquidated Damages. After the hearing, if the City Council sustains in whole or in part the City 
Manager's Assessment of Liquidated Damages, the City Manager may at any time thereafter draw 
upon any of the security funds provided for by this chapter and/or the franchise agreement. Unless 
the City Council indicates to the contrary, said liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with 
the date on which the city sent the Notice of the Intention to Assess Liquidated Damages and 
continuing thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined by the City Manager. 
Grantee may appeal any determination of the City Council to an appropriate forum. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.230 - Alternative remedies. 
    The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and in addition to all other rights the city may 
have at law or equity or under the franchise, which remedies may be exercised at any time. In no event 
shall the amount of any bond or letter of credit be construed to limit grantee's liability for damages. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.240 - Removal and abandonmentPurchase of system. 
A. ?Subject to applicable law, in the event that a franchise is terminated, revoked, or is not renewed 
upon expiration, then grantee shall, upon demand of the city, and at its sole expense, promptly 
remove all or any portion of its cable system. In removing its cable system, grantee shall refill, at its 
own expense, any excavation it made and leave all streets in as good condition as that prevailing 
prior to grantee's removal of its cable system without materially affecting the electrical or telephone 
cable, wires, or attachments. The liability, indemnity, insurance, security fund and bonds required 
under the franchise shall continue in full force and effect until such removal is accepted as complete 
by the city. 
B. ?Subject to applicable law, in the event that a franchise is not renewed and the city acquires 
ownership of a cable system or effects a transfer of ownership of a cable system to another person, 
any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable 
system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. If a franchise is 
revoked for cause and the city acquires ownership of the cable system or effects a transfer of 
ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at an 
equitable price. The value of a cable system (fair market value or equitable price) shall be 
determined by an appraisal committee consisting of three disinterested appraisers. The city and 
grantee shall each select at their individual discretion one appraiser, and the two selected appraisers 
shall agree upon and appoint a third appraiser. 
C. ?If a grantee's plant, or a portion thereof, is deactivated for a continuous period of thirty (30) days, 
(except for reasons beyond the grantee's control), and without prior written notice to and approval by 
city, then the grantee must, at city's option and demand, and at the sole expense of the grantee, 
promptly remove all of the grantee's property from any streets or other public rights-of-way. The 
grantee must promptly restore the streets or other public areas from which its property, including 
distribution facilities, has been removed to the condition existing prior to the grantee's use thereof. 
D. ?City may, upon written application by a grantee, approve the abandonment in place by a grantee of 
any property, under such terms and conditions as city may approve. Upon city-approved 
abandonment in place of any property, the grantee must cause to be executed, acknowledged, and 
delivered to the city such instruments as the city may prescribe and approve in order to transfer and 
convey ownership of that property to the city. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.250 - Receivership and foreclosure. 
A. ?Subject to applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, any franchise shall, at the 
option of the city, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a 
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of grantee whether in a receivership, 
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship 
shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: 
1. ?Such receiver or trustee shall have, within one hundred twenty (120) days after his/her election 
or appointment, fully complied with all terms of the franchise and remedied all breaches of the 
franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such breaches which is approved in writing by the 
city; and, 
2. ?Such receiver or trustee shall, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, execute an 
agreement duly approved by the Court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee 
assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the 
franchise. 
B. ?Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of a cable system, grantee shall 
notify the City Clerk of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change 
in ownership of grantee has taken place and the provisions of this chapter governing such changes 
shall apply. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000)

    Grantee may be required to obtain and maintain throughout the period of any construction (or

and full activation of the cable system, and the safeguarding of damage to private property and restorage 
of damages incurred by utilities. The bond shall be filed with the City Clerk at least thirty (30) days prior to 
the commencement of any construction, and shall be in the form specified and approved by the City

(45) days after the award, renewal or transfer of a franchise and shall be in the form specified and 
approved by the City Attorney. Specific requirements pertaining to the letter of credit, including 
amount, shall be specified in the franchise agreement. 
B. ?Grantee shall restore the letter of credit to the original amount within thirty (30) days after notice from 
the city that an amount has been withdrawn.

but not limited to, expenses for legal fees, whether suit be brought or not, and disbursements and

grantee's negligence or that of their servants, agents, officials, attorneys, representatives or 
employees shall in any way contribute; 
2. ?Requests for relief arising out of any grantee action or inaction which results in a claim of

    Grantee will not be required to indemnify the city from claims, demands, actions, suits, liabilities 
and judgments arising out of the sole acts or omissions of the city. 
B. ?Grantee shall at its sole cost defend the city against any suit brought or threatened against the city in 
connection with the above matters. Grantee shall pay all such defense costs that accrue or are 
incurred after the city provides notice to grantee of such suit. Such costs include, but are not limited 
to, attorney's fees and the reasonable value of services rendered by the city of any of its employees, 
officials, attorneys, servants, agents or representatives. 
C. ?The city shall indemnify, and hold harmless grantee, its affiliates and their respective officers,

city's use of PEG channels. This indemnity shall not apply with respect to any programming provided 
by grantee and carried on such access channels. 
(Ord. 140 § 1 (part), 2000) 


5.52.300 - Insurance. 
A. ?Within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of the franchise agreement, grantee shall file with 
the City Clerk, and shall thereafter during the entire term of such franchise, maintain in full force and 
effect, at its own expense, a general comprehensive liability insurance policy or policies which shall 
insure grantee and provide primary coverage for the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents 
and employees, against liability for loss or liability for personal injury, death, property damage (both 
automobile and nonautomobile caused), premises operations, explosion and collapse hazard, 
underground hazards, or other damages. Such policy or policies shall include insurance against 
damages from, and any failure by grantee to secure consents, occasioned by any activity or

However, the Director of Community Services (hereinafter "Director"), or his or her duly authorized agent 
or representative, may waive the two-declarant requirement and accept a single declaration, if he or she 
determines geographic or other circumstances exist whereby a noise disturbance caused by an animal 
affects only one individual. A barking dog declaration of complaint shall state, in detail, all of the following: 
A. ?That the declarant is a resident of a residential neighborhood located within two hundred (200) 
yards of the boundaries of the premises where the dog is located; 
B. ?Within the past month, the declarant has heard the dog bark for substantially long periods of 
time to the extreme annoyance or discomfort of the declarant; 
1. ?Any noise, which is audible continuously for ten (10) minutes or intermittently for thirty (30)

return receipt requested, that an administrative hearing is to be held on a date, at least ten (10) days 
from the date the notice is received, concerning the dog's continuous barking. 
D. ?At the time and place of the hearing, each complaining party, witnesses, and the Enforcing Officer

A. ?The Hearing Officer shall hear all facts and testimony which he or she deems pertinent. Such facts 
and testimony may include all evidence relevant to the nature of the complaint. The Hearing Officer 
shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the dog or the person in whose 
custody the dog is may present a written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny 
responsibility, with reasons for such denial. In the case of a barking dog, such reasons for denial 
might include barking to protect the residence on the property from trespassers, other animals on the 
property, or that the barking is in response to sirens or other unusual noises. 
B. ?The Hearing Officer may impose such conditions and take such other action as deemed appropriate

dog, the Hearing Officer may give the dog owner or the person in whose control the dog is in more 
time to control the dog's barking, if it is his or her opinion that the circumstances so justify. At the 
conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer may find that there is a public nuisance and can order 
that the dog be removed from the property and/or disposed of as provided in this title, and determine 
the administrative costs and costs of removal to be charge against the owner of the dog or person 
who has custody of the dog.

decision is mailed to the owner of the dog or the person in whose custody the dog is, unless an

Officer is mailed, or twenty-one (21) days after the notice of the City Council action on appeal is mailed if 
it is a timely appeal, in which to permanently remove the dog from the City. If the dog is not removed from 
the City, within such period, or if the dog is removed and is thereafter returned to the city, the Hearing

conditions which are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and 
community appearance, or hazardous or injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the general

necessary to effectively abate or prevent the development of such conditions in the city. 
B. ?It is the intention of the City Council, in adopting this chapter, to set forth guidelines for determining 
what conditions constitute a public nuisance; to establish a method for giving notice of the conditions 
and an opportunity to correct them; and finally in the event the public nuisance is not abated or 
corrected, to provide a procedure for a hearing and determination of the facts and manner in which 
the conditions shall be corrected or removed. 
C. ?It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a just, equitable, and practical method, in addition to any 
other remedy available at law or equity, whereby lands or buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, 
dangerous, unsanitary, cluttered with weeds and/or debris, abandoned vehicles, machinery or 
equipment, or are a menace, or hazard to life, limb, safety, health, morals, property values, aesthetic 
standards, or the general welfare of the city, may be required to be repaired, renovated, vacated, 
demolished, made safe, or cleaned up by removal of offensive conditions.

public nuisances and that maintenance of such conditions shall be a misdemeanor. 
G. ?This chapter is not intended to enforce conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CC&R's) on property, 
nor to supersede them. This chapter will be enforced uniformly within the city regardless of CC&R's. 
Therefore, this chapter does not abrogate the right of any homeowners association or private citizen 
to take action, legal or as otherwise provided in the CC&R's, to force compliance with the CC&R's 
applicable to their tract or association even though the CC&R provisions may be the same, more 
restrictive, or may not be covered by this chapter.

(Ord. No. 308, § 1, 3-14-2017) 


8.16.060 - Findings. 
    The City Council hereby finds that the proposed amendments to the Fire Code are reasonable and 
necessary because of local climactic, geologic and topographical conditions within the City's jurisdiction. 
This finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these 
conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary: 
1. ?The climate weather patterns within the City include frequent periods of drought and low 
humidity adding to the fire danger. Fire season can be year-round in this region. 
2. ?During the summer months the dry winds and existing vegetation mix to create a hazardous fuel 
condition which has resulted in large loss vegetation and structure fires. Summer temperatures 
exceeding one hundred degrees (100°), and severe "Santa Ana" winds frequently occur and 
can move a fire quickly throughout areas of the City. Multiple shifting wind patterns throughout 
the canyon areas add to the difficulty in suppressing fires. 
3. ?Because of weather patterns, the City has experienced a need for water conservation. Due to 
the storage capacities and consumption, and a limited amount of rainfall (drought conditions), 
future water allocation is not fully dependable. While sound management of the water resources 
is possible, demands and possible critical depletions on an already stressed water supply can 
most assuredly be predicted. 
4. ?Features located throughout the City are major roadways, highways, freeways and flood control 
channels which create barriers and slow response times. Other unique factors which create 
barriers and slow response times are the multiple canyons located within the City and the large 
California Institute for Men property. 
5. ?The topography is also very steep in large areas of the City affecting the rate of fire spread and 
response times. 
6. ?Due to the sloping in the regional valley where the City is located, as well as the present street 
and storm drain design, heavy rainfall causes roadway flooding and landslides which at times 
may make an access route impassable. 
7. ?The City has within its boundaries active seismic hazards. Seismic activity within the City occurs 
yearly and a fire potential exists with these active faults. Existing structures and planned new 
development are at serious risk from an earthquake. This risk includes fire, collapse and the 
disruption of water supply for firefighting purposes. Areas can also become isolated as a result 
of bridge, overpass and road damage and debris. 
8. ?Structures in close proximity to each other pose an exposure problem which may cause a fire to 
spread from one structure to another as well as to the wildland area. 
9. ?For practical and cost reasons, many new structures are built of wood construction. Many 
existing structures also have wood shake roofs. The potential for a conflagration exists due to 
the design and density of current structures. 
10. ?Electrical supply and telephone communication failures occur due to high winds as well as 
others reasons. Water supply pumps and early notification cannot always be counted on. 
11. ?Narrow and winding streets with little circulation and streets designed as storm drains impede 
emergency vehicle access and evacuation routes. 
    Each of the numbered findings above is located below the section to which it relates.

A. ?In addition to and in accordance with the authority granted to the city by the state under Section 
22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or 
parts of such vehicles as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and 
declarations. 
B. ?The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts 
of such vehicles on private or public property is found to create a condition tending to reduce the 
value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire 
hazards, to constitute a nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a 
harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the 
public. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or 
parts of such vehicles, on private or public property except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is 
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter.

connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, junk dealer, or 
when such storage or parking is necessary to the operation of a lawfully conducted business or 
commercial enterprise. 
B. ?Nothing in this section shall authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance as defined 
under provisions of law other than Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 22650) of Division 11 of the

Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 300u, §§ 3, 4, adopted July 12, 2016, repealed former Ch. 13.08, §§ 
13.08.01013.08.120, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Ch. 13.08 
pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 286, § 4, adopted on June, 8, 2015. 


13.08.010 - Findings of necessity. 
    It is necessary to minimize the potential for water shortage through the practice of water 
conservation pursuant to California Water Code § 375 et seq., based upon the need to conserve water 
supplies and to avoid or minimize the effects of any future shortage. It is further necessary to reduce the 
potential effect of a water shortage on the residents, businesses and visitors of Chino Hills and to adopt 
provisions that will significantly reduce the inefficient consumption of water, thereby extending the 
available water resources necessary for the domestic, sanitation, and fire protection of the community to 
the greatest extent possible. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from also declaring a water 
emergency pursuant to Water Code Section 350. 
(Ord. No. 300u, § 4, 7-12-2016) 


13.08.020 - Water customer. 
    Water customer, for the purposes of this chapter, shall mean any person, partnership, business, 
corporation, or association or legal entity to whom the City of Chino Hills (City) supplies water or user of 
water supplied by the City. 
(Ord. No. 300u, § 4, 7-12-2016) 


13.08.030 - Application. 
    This chapter shall be applicable to all water customers. 
(Ord. No. 300u, § 4, 7-12-2016) 


13.08.040 - Exceptions and exemptions. 
A. ?Exceptions. The City Manager or his/her designee shall grant an exception from the requirements of 
this chapter for any of the following reasons: 
1. ?Water use is necessary for public health and safety; or 
2. ?Recycled water is being used; or 
3. ?Water use is necessary due to the medical needs of the water customer. 
B. ?Exemptions. The Public Works Commission may grant an exemption to the requirements of this 
chapter, with or without conditions, if it determines that a water customer would otherwise experience 
extreme financial hardship that cannot be mitigated. The Public Works Commission shall review any 
requests for an exemption from compliance with this chapter. A written request for an exemption 
must be submitted to the Public Works Department a minimum of two weeks prior to the Commission 
meeting at which the exemption is to be considered. If appropriate, the Public Works Commission 
may require the customer granted an exemption to reduce water use by other appropriate alternative 
methods. A decision of the Public Works Commission may be appealed to the City Council in 
accordance with Chino Hills Municipal Code Section 1.20.010. The City Council may establish by 
resolution an "exemption processing fee." 
(Ord. No. 300u, § 4, 7-12-2016) 


13.08.050 - Authorization. 
    The City Council may declare the conservation stage based on any of the following circumstances:

severe conservation alerts shall apply on a voluntary basis. 
(Ord. No. 300u, § 4, 7-12-2016)

(A) ?A description of the materials of value deposited in the container and an 
estimate of their value; 
(B) ?The address, telephone number and contact person of the facility or facilities 
with whom the owner has arranged for the contents to be processed or recycled, 
and proof of that arrangement; 
(C) ?Evidence that the facility or facilities where the contents are destined to be 
processed or recycled carries all requisite approvals, permits, or other forms of 
authorization required by any governmental agency having jurisdiction, to 
conduct processing or recycling activities; 
(D) ?A declaration from the customer receiving service, signed under penalty of 
perjury, that the customer was charged no fee from the service provider in 
exchange for service, and that the contents of the container were either donated 
or sold by the customer to the service provider/owner; 
(E) ?The city shall have the right to request such additional information as may be 
necessary or useful in determining the validity of the owner's contest. 
ii. ?If the city, acting through the City Manager or his designee, determines, in the 
exercise of reasonable discretion, that the owner has supplied evidence sufficient to 
support its contention that it was engaged in a legitimate recycling activity involving 
donated or sold materials, the container shall be returned to the owner without any 
charge for removal or storage of same. 
d. ?If the identity of the owner of a container that has been removed by the city is known to the 
City Manager, the City Manager shall promptly cause notice to be mailed to the owner to 
claim the stored property. If the container is not claimed within ninety-five (95) days after 
removal and notice to the owner, or ninety (90) days after removal if the identity of the 
owner is unknown to the City Manager, the container and its contents shall be deemed 
abandoned property and may be disposed of accordingly. Where the contents present 
imminent threat to public health and safety, as determined by the city, they may be 
processed or disposed of without awaiting the expiration of the ninety (90) day claim 
period. 
e. ?After a container has once been removed by the city pursuant to a notice to remove, the 
owner thereof shall be deemed to have actual notice of the provisions of this chapter, 
including the prohibition against the placement of unauthorized containers. In the event of 
a subsequent placement of a container owned by the same owner, or an affiliate of the 
owner, the City Manager may immediately, without the posting of a notice to remove, direct 
the removal and storage of the unlawfully placed container and shall, in such case, give 
notice to the owner to claim the container. In such event, the owner shall, subject to the 
provisions of subsection (D)(1)(c) of this section, be responsible to reimburse the city for 
the actual cost of such removal, storage and disposal, which cost shall be paid by the 
owner before the container may be returned to the owner. If the container is unclaimed 
after notice is mailed to the owner and the expiration of the period set forth in subsection 
(D)(1)(d) of this section, the container and its contents shall be deemed abandoned 
property and may be disposed of accordingly. The costs incurred by the city for removal, 
storage and disposal shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the owner, who shall be 
liable therefore in an action by the city for the recovery of such amounts. 
f. ?Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the City Manager is 
authorized to direct the immediate removal, without notice, of any container placed on 
public or private property within the city in violation of this chapter where the owner of the 
container is unidentified and cannot be ascertained by an inspection of the container. 
E. ?Notwithstanding subsection D above, temporary service bins may be placed on any public or private 
property within the city if they meet all of the following criteria: 
1. ?The temporary service bin is used only for the collection of recyclable materials. 
2. ?The temporary service bin contains only recyclable materials, and contains no solid waste. 
3. ?All recyclable materials in the temporary service bin are donated to a nonprofit corporation. In 
determining the application of this section, the City Manager may request documentation from 
the temporary service bin owner of the non-profit status of the corporation to which the 
recyclable materials are donated. 
4. ?All recyclable materials collected in the temporary service bin are handled and reported in 
compliance with Section 13.20.180 of this code. 
(Ord. 213 § 1 (part), 2008) 


13.24.030 - Administration. 
    The City Manager is hereby authorized to adopt regulations as necessary for governing the 
administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. 213 § 1 (part), 2008) 


13.24.040 - Penalty for violation. 
    It is unlawful and a misdemeanor subject to punishment in accordance with Section 1.36.010 et seq. 
of this code for any person to violate any provision of this chapter. 
(Ord. 213 § 1 (part), 2008) 


13.24.050 - Civil remedies unaffected. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to limit the right of a holder of a franchise issued in 
accordance with Section 13.20.070 for temporary service bins placed on single-family residential 
properties, or 13.20.080 of this code for temporary service bins placed on commercial properties, or the 
city, to bring a civil action against any person who violates this chapter, nor shall a conviction for such 
violation exempt any person from a civil action brought by a franchisee or the city.

    "Double check valve assembly" means an assembly of at least two independently acting check 
valves including tightly closing shut-off valves on each side of the check valve assembly and test cocks 
available for testing the water tightness of each check valve. 
    Hazard, Degree of. "Degree of hazard" is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public 
health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. 
1. ?"Health hazard" is any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and its operation 
which could create, or in the judgment of the division, county, or state health official, may create 
a danger to the health and well being of the water consumer. 
2. ?"Plumbing hazard" is a plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer's potable water system 
that has not been properly protected by an approved air-gap or approved backflow prevention 
assembly. 
3. ?"Pollutional hazard" is an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system 
or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would 
constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or 
its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health. 
4. ?"System hazard" is an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of 
the public potable water system of the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or 
contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the 
system.

water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely 
and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use. 
    "Premises" means any and all areas on a customer's property which are served or have the potential 
to be served by the public water system. 
    "Public water system" means a system for the provision of piped water to the public for human

(Ord. 108 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.28.030 - Cross-connection protection requirements. 
A. ?General Provisions. 
1. ?Unprotected cross-connections with the public water supply are prohibited. 
2. ?Whenever backflow protection has been found necessary, the city will require the water user to 
install an approved backflow prevention device by and at his or her expense for continued 
services or before a new service will be granted. 
3. ?Wherever backflow protection has been found necessary on a water supply line entering a 
water user's premises, then any and all water supply lines from the city's mains entering such 
premises, buildings, or structures shall be protected by an approved backflow prevention 
device. The type of device to be installed will be in accordance with the requirements of this 
chapter. 
B. ?Where Protection is Required. 
1. ?Each service connection from the city water system for supplying water to premises having an 
auxiliary water supply shall be protected against backflow of water from the premises into the 
public water system unless the auxiliary water supply is accepted as an additional source by the 
city, and is approved by the public health agency having jurisdiction. 
2. ?Each service connection from the city water system for supplying water to any premises on 
which any substance is handled in such fashion as to allow its entry into the water system shall 
be protected against backflow of the water from the premises into the public system. This shall 
include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the city water system which 
have been subjected to deterioration in sanitary quality. 
3. ?Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service connection to any premises having 
(a) internal cross-connection that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled to the 
satisfaction of the state or local health department and the city, or (b) intricate plumbing and 
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for 
inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not cross-
connections exist. 
C. ?Type of Protection Required. 
1. ?The type of protection that shall be provided to prevent backflow into the approved water supply 
shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard that exists on the consumer's premises. The 
type of protective device that may be required (listing in an increasing level of protection) 
includes: Double Check Valve Assembly (DC), Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow 
Prevention Device (RP), and an air-gap separation (AG). The water user may choose a higher 
level of protection than required by the city. The minimum types of backflow protection required 
to protect the approved water supply, at the user's water connection to premises with varying 
degrees of hazard are given in Table 1 below. Situations which are not covered in Table 1 shall 
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the appropriate backflow protection shall be 
determined by the city or health agency. 
2. ?Two or more services supplying water from different street mains to the same building or 
premises through which an inter-street main flow may occur, shall have at least a standard 
check valve on each water service to be located adjacent to and on the property side of the 
respective meters. This check valve shall not be considered adequate if backflow protection is 
deemed necessary to protect the city's mains from pollution or contamination; in such cases, 
the installation of approved backflow devices at such service connection shall be required.

13.32.020 - Introduction. 
A. ?The city is partially dependent on imported water for domestic, agricultural, irrigation, commercial 
and industrial uses. This imposed supply is considered limited and its future is reliability uncertain. It 
is in the best interests of the city to promote and implement innovative water management strategies 
to conserve water resources while still satisfying water needs of the city's customers. The city 
operates and maintains portions of a region-wide reclaimed water distribution network within the 
city's potable water service area enabling it to provide tertiary treated reclaimed water from the 
district for a variety of beneficial uses. This alternate supply allows large quantities of higher quality 
potable water to be made available for domestic use. 
B. ?The use of reclaimed water from domestic sewage is regulated by the California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board Santa Ana Region (RWQCB). California Water Code Section 13551 
establishes a state policy to encourage the use of reclaimed water. Permission to use reclaimed 
water is based on the district's ability to adequately treat domestic wastewater to the point that the 
reclaimed water (effluent) meets the requirements of existing Title 22, Division 4, Chapter 3 
Regulations of the California Administrative Code. Title 22, Division 4 was promulgated by the State 
Department of Health Services to ensure proper health protection and specify the treatment degree 
to match the intended applications. 
C. ?In accordance with waste discharge requirements for water reclamation projects, the RWQCB 
requires regulation measures for facilities distributing reclaimed water. 
1. ?Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish rules and regulations including procedures, 
specifications, and limitations for the safe and orderly development and operation of reclaimed 
water facilities and systems within the city's service area. 
2. ?Goals. 
a. ?Achieve conservation of potable water supplies by using reclaimed water for current and 
future demands. Reclaimed water uses shall be for the maximum public benefit and may 
include, upon City Council approval and compliance with all applicable regulations: 
i. ?Agricultural irrigation; 
ii. ?Commercial uses; 
iii. ?Construction use; 
iv. ?Groundwater recharge; 
v. ?Industrial processes; 
vi. ?Landscape irrigation; 
vii. ?Landscape and/or recreational impoundment; 
viii. ?Wildlife habitat. 
b. ?Maintain reclaimed water quality through a stringent pretreatment program for commercial 
and industrial wastes and by restricting brine discharges from water softeners, evaporative 
coolers, and other sources. 
c. ?Prevent direct human consumption of reclaimed water through: 
i. ?Adherence to all applicable rules and regulations; 
ii. ?Posting of warning signs by the user; 
iii. ?Cross-connection/backflow prevention pro-gram. 
d. ?Control runoff of reclaimed water through monitoring of the installation and operation of all 
reclaimed water facilities and use areas. 
e. ?Monitor reclaimed water quality. 
3. ?Policy. It is the policy of the city that reclaimed water be used for any purpose approved for 
reclaimed water use, when it is economically, financially, technically, and institutionally feasible. 
Use of potable water for nondomestic uses shall be contrary to the city policy and shall not be 
considered the most beneficial use of a natural resource and shall be avoided to the maximum 
extent possible. 
4. ?Priority. Reclaimed water shall be provided on a first-come, first-served basis, as long as 
reclaimed water is available. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998)

A. ?General. 
1. ?The city may adopt a water reclamation master plan ("Master Plan") designated current and 
potential areas for reclaimed water use. The Master Plan shall be in accordance with all 
regulatory agency's requirements and shall encourage reclaimed water use. The Master Plan 
may be reviewed and updated as needed. 
2. ?The city may review its Master Plan and determine where water service shall be made with 
reclaimed water in place of potable water. Where it is determined reclaimed water is, or will be 
available, the city may require modifications to existing on-site water facilities and require 
construction of reclaimed water systems in all new developments. 
3. ?The city may enter into agreements with surrounding cities and/or other water agencies to 
determine reclaimed water use areas within the service area/jurisdiction of those entities. 
B. ?Existing Potable Water Service.

determinations of areas where existing potable water use shall be made with reclaimed water. 
2. ?A notice of the determination to use reclaimed water shall be sent to the current owner 
explaining the city's reasons for use and resultant procedures needed to facilitate reclaimed 
water use. The owner shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to comply with the city's 
determination. The city may allow for an extension if warranted. 
C. ?New Reclaimed Water Service. Upon submittal by applicant of a tentative map, land use permit, or 
request for reclaimed water service, the city shall review the Master Plan and make preliminary 
determinations if reclaimed water service should be provided to the area in question. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.070 - Authorized uses. 
    In accordance with the goals of the city, as stated in this chapter, the uses of reclaimed water shall 
include only uses approved by the California State Department of Health Services (DOHS) and for which 
Title 22, Division 4, Chapter 3, "Wastewater Reclamation Criteria" of the California Code of Regulations 
provides treatment requirements. Each such use will be considered for approval on a case-by-case basis. 
Prior to approval and at its discretion, the city may set forth specific requirements as conditions to

(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.120 - Rates, fees, charges, and deposits. 
A. ?General. All rates and charges relating to reclaimed water service shall be established by resolution 
of the City Council. Applicants for reclaimed water service shall pay their fair share for the 
construction of facilities needed to deliver reclaimed water to the applicant's property. All fees and 
estimated construction costs shall be paid prior to construction; however, the city may reimburse the 
applicant for a portion of the cost of such facilities as set in subsection D of this section. 
B. ?Change of Rates or Charges. The city reserves the right to change the schedule of reclaimed water 
rates, service charges, and any other charges, deposits, or fees at any time. These charges are 
subject to the terms of any existing reclaimed water service permits (and/or agreements) and will be 
made by appropriate action of the city. 
C. ?Temporary Service. The reclaimed water rate for all water sold through temporary meters shall be 
established by resolution of the City Council. 
D. ?Financial Participation By City. Under certain circumstances, the city may contribute to the cost of 
constructing the facilities needed to deliver reclaimed water to an applicant's property. Subject to the 
availability of funds, the city may: 
1. ?Reimburse an applicant for costs incurred to install oversized facilities; 
2. ?Elect to participate in or construct supply lines, main lines, reservoirs, pumping stations or other 
facilities, as it determines necessary, and/or as funds are available. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.130 - Size, location and installation of service line. 
A. ?The city reserves the right to determine the size and location and/or type of: 
1. ?Reclaimed water service lines; 
2. ?Service connections; 
3. ?Meters; 
4. ?Backflow protection devices and other appurtenances in the service area. 
B. ?The reclaimed water service lines shall be extended to an area abutting upon a public street, 
highway, road or city easement in which reclaimed water mains are installed. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.140 - Service connection limitations. 
    Permits for reclaimed water service shall be issued under the following conditions: 
A. ?The city reserves the right to limit the area of land under one ownership or homeowner's 
association to be supplied by one reclaimed water service connection and one reclaimed water 
meter. 
B. ?A reclaimed water service connection and its corresponding meter shall not be used to supply 
adjoining property of a different owner. 
C. ?A service connection shall not be used to supply adjoining property of a different owner or to 
supply property of the same owner across a road, street or other public right-of-way. When a 
property which is provided with a reclaimed water connection and corresponding meter is 
subdivided, such connection and meter shall be considered as serving the lot or parcel of land 
on which the meter is located. Additional reclaimed water mains and/or reclaimed water service 
lines will be required for all subdivided areas in accordance with this chapter. 
D. ?Irrigation systems in homeowner's asso-ciations and other developments where landscaping 
around homes and in common areas are served with one meter shall be allowed to cross under 
roads, streets, or other right-of-ways within the association's or developer's property. 
E. ?All reclaimed water used on any property where a meter is installed must pass through the 
meter. Customers shall be held responsible and charged for all reclaimed water passing 
through their meters. 
F. ?Every reclaimed water service line installed shall be equipped with a curb stop or wheel valve 
on the inlet side of the meter. The valve or curb stop is to be used only by city personnel to 
control the reclaimed water supply through the water service line. If the wheel valve or curb stop 
is damaged by the customer, then the customer shall bear full financial responsibility for 
replacement. 
G. ?When a reasonable service pressure would not be available to on-site facilities not previously 
served from the potable water system, the user shall be responsible for correcting this situation 
upon conversion to the reclaimed water system. If available service pressure is too high, the 
user shall utilize pressure regulator(s) downstream of the meter to obtain the correct pressure. If 
available pressure is too low, the user shall provide booster pumping to increase the pressure. 
When a reasonable service pressure would not be available to on-site facilities previously 
served from the potable water system, correcting this situation upon conversion to the reclaimed 
system shall be handled as follows: 
1. ?If user-provided booster pumping or pressure regulation was required for on-site facilities 
when service was provided from the potable system then any booster pumping or pressure 
regulation required for reclaimed water service shall be provided by the user. 
2. ?If reasonable service pressure was available for the on-site facilities when service was 
provided from the potable system, then any action needed to provide reclaimed water 
service shall be considered on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with the city. 
H. ?Service is commenced after issuance of a permit for reclaimed water service by the city. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.150 - Relocation of reclaimed water service lines. 
    Should a reclaimed water service line installed according to the directions of the applicant, owner, or 
customer (user) be of the wrong size or installed at a wrong location or depth, the cost of relocation or 
removal shall be paid for by the user where the error was that of the user or the user's representative. All 
services provided prior to final street improvements shall be considered temporary and the costs for any 
repairs or changes to on-site facilities required to be performed by the city shall be paid by the user. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.160 - Protective measures. 
A. ?The following provisions are to protect the city's potable and reclaimed water supplies against actual, 
undiscovered, unauthorized, or potential cross-connections to the user's reclaimed water system. 
These provisions are in addition to, not in lieu of, the controls and requirements of other regulatory 
agencies. These provisions are in accordance with Title 17 (Public Health) of the California 
Administrative Code. These regulations are intended to protect the city water supplies and are not 
intended to provide regulatory measures for protection of users from the hazards of cross-
connections within their own property. 
B. ?Approved backflow prevention devices on the city's potable and reclaimed water services to the 
property, as required in these provisions, shall be provided, installed, tested, and maintained at user 
expense. These devices shall be located on the property served immediately downstream of the 
meter and shall not be on the city's facilities. All devices shall be readily accessible for testing and 
maintenance. 
C. ?When reclaimed water service is initiated, the applicant must provide sufficient information, including 
plumbing and building plans, to enable the city and other regulatory agencies to determine the level 
of backflow protection required. The proper backflow protection as determined by the city and other 
regulatory agencies shall then be installed and inspected before reclaimed water service is provided. 
Each time there is a change of customer (either owner or tenant) on any commercial or industrial 
premise, the user shall notify the city immediately. The city will then reassess the level of protection 
required. Also, any alterations to existing on-site facilities that may affect required protection level 
must be reported immediately to the city. 
D. ?At their discretion, representatives of any health agency having jurisdiction, the city, and CBMWD 
may conduct surveys of any property where water service is provided by the city. These surveys are 
to determine if any actual or potential cross-connections exist. The applicant, owner, or user shall 
provide full cooperation in facilitating these surveys. 
1. ?Where Protection is Required. Approved backflow protection for potable water supplies shall be 
provided as follows: 
a. ?Each city water service connection that supplies potable water to a premises having an 
auxiliary water supply that is not accepted as a potable source by the city and is approved 
for such use by the San Bernardino County DOHS shall be protected against backflow 
from the premises into the city water systems. 
b. ?Each city water service connection for supplying potable water to a premises on which any 
substance is handled in a fashion as to permit entry into the city water system from the 
premises shall be protected against backflow from the premises into the city water system. 
This shall include, but not be limited to, the handling of process waters, waters originating 
from any of the city water systems that have been subject to deterioration in quality, and 
agricultural use. 
c. ?Backflow devices shall be installed where premises have intricate plumbing and piping 
arrangements or where not all portions of the premises are readily accessible for 
inspection. 
d. ?Backflow protection may be required at premises where there has been a history of cross-
connections being reestablished. 
2. ?Other Measures. 
a. ?Whenever possible the city will operate the reclaimed water system at a lower pressure 
than potable water systems. This will cause potable water to flow to the reclaimed water 
system in the event of a cross-connection. 
b. ?Water meters and backflow devices used for reclaimed water service shall be tagged or 
color-coded purple, color pantone 512 or 522, or otherwise distinguished as such. These 
meters shall not be interchanged or used for potable water service after repairs and/or 
meter testing have been performed. 
c. ?Periodic inspection of the reclaimed water facilities will determine if all identifying items are 
still clearly discernible. If not, they will be replaced, repaired or refurbished as needed. 
These items include: 
i. ?Warning tags; 
ii. ?Painted surfaces; 
iii. ?Warning tape; 
iv. ?Identification tape; 
v. ?Covers, caps, signs; 
vi. ?Other items that indicate reclaimed water is being used. 
d. ?Acceptable tracer dyes may periodically be introduced into the reclaimed water system by 
the city, CBMWD or local health agency, to determine the existence of any cross-
connections or backflow conditions into the potable water system. 
e. ?In the event of contamination or pollution of a city potable water system due to a cross-
connection or other failure, the San Bernardino County DOHS and the city shall be 
promptly notified so that appropriate measures will be taken to correct the problem. 
f. ?The state and county health departments and the city shall be kept informed by written 
document of the identity of the person responsible for the user's reclaimed water system 
on all premises concerned with these rules and regulations. At each authorized use area, 
an on-site Reclaimed Water Supervisors shall be designated and responsible for including, 
but not limited to, the following: 
i. ?The installation and use of all components of the on-site reclaimed water system(s); 
ii. ?Prevention of cross-connections; 
iii. ?Change in use of reclaimed water. 
3. ?Water Service Termination. When the city determines that reclaimed water uses or conditions 
encountered by the city represent a clear and immediate hazard to the city's potable and/or 
reclaimed water supply that cannot be immediately removed or corrected, the city shall reserve 
the right to terminate reclaimed water use. Conditions or uses that create a basis for termination 
include, but are not limited to: 
a. ?Refusal to install a required backflow prevention device; 
b. ?Refusal to test a backflow prevention device; 
c. ?Refusal to repair or replace a faulty backflow prevention device; 
d. ?Direct or indirect connection between the potable and reclaimed water systems; 
e. ?Direct or indirect connection between the reclaimed water system and a system or 
equipment containing contaminants; 
f. ?A situation which presents an immediate health hazard to the city potable and/or reclaimed 
water system, as determined by the city, CBMWD, or other regulatory agency. 
(Ord. 101 § 1 (part), 1998) 


13.32.170 - Type of protection. 
    The level of protection required is related to the degree of hazard that exists on the premises served. 
Listed in increasing levels of protection, the following protective backflow devices may be required: 
double check valve (DC), reduced pressure principle device (RPPD), and an air gap separation (AG). The 
user may choose a higher level of protection than required by the city or other regulatory agencies. 
Minimum types required, relative to various situations, are listed below. Situations not listed will be 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the appropriate level of protection required shall be determined by 
the city or the San Bernardino County Department of Health Service. These shall include situations where 
on-site conditions could impact the reclaimed water quality.

Chapter 15.12 - FLOODPLAIN DAMAGE PREVENTION AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
Sections: 


Article I. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 


15.12.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 
65800 conferred upon local government units' authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the 
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Chino 
Hills does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.020 - Findings of fact. 
A. ?The flood hazard areas of the City of Chino Hills are subject to periodic inundation which results in 
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental 
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax 
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B. ?These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected 
from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that 
increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A. ?Protect human life and health; 
B. ?Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C. ?Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D. ?Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E. ?Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, 
telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F. ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of 
special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G. ?Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H. ?Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their 
actions. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A. ?Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or 
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B. ?Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C. ?Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, 
which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D. ?Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
and 
E. ?Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or 
which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006)

allowed for a single lot subdivision and construction of structures is underway. Residential 
subdivisions must meet the density criteria in subsection 1.c. above 
    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but 
not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling 
operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings,

for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain 
management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of 
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are 
to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading 
or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood, flooding, or flood water" means: 
1. ?A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas 
from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of 
surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2. ?The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
    "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of 
special flood hazards and the floodway. 
    "Flood Hazard Boundary Map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood 
hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration 
that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and 
the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from 
any source. See "Flood, flooding, or flood water." 
    "Floodplain Administrator" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain 
management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive 
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in 
the floodplain including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain 
management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means the ordinance codified in this chapter and other zoning 
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such 
as grading and erosion control) and other applications of police power which control development in 
flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof that 
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or 
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real 
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins 
TB 1 -93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet flood proofing.) 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must 
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface 
elevation more than one foot (also referred to as "Regulatory Floodway"). 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where 
encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means that the 
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the 
City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government 
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings 
that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to 
increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole 
are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages 
bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood 
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is 
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities 
that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship 
repair facilities, and does include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, which is empowered to adopt 
and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional 
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that 
the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial 
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal 
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional 
hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if 
the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a 
different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to 
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1. ?Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the 
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting 
the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2. ?Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the 
historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the 
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3. ?Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation 
programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4. ?Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation 
programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved 
programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in 
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to 
provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated 
structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with 
sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see 
"Basement" definition). 
1. ?An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking 
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered 
a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, 
including, but not limited to: 
a. ?The wet flood proofing standard in Article V, Section 15.12.170.C.3 
b. ?The anchoring standards in Article V, Section 15.12.170.A 
c. ?The construction materials and methods standards in Article V, Section 15.12.170. B 
d. ?The standards for utilities in Article V, Section 15.12.180 
2. ?For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to 
be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and 
storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a 
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the 
required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into 
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market Value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition 
and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation, which has accrued since the structure was 
constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor 
determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction 
industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical 
deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, 
but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or 
accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides 
may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional 
appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National 
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a 
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "Start of 
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by 
this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain 
management regulations adopted by this community. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, 
abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, 
gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any 
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or veloCity of the flow of water, 
or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood 
of being carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means that 
the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire 
community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free 
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle that is: 
1. ?Built on a single chassis; 
2. ?Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3. ?Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4. ?Designed primarily as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal 
use, and not for use as a permanent dwelling. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land 
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the 
water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or 
local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its 
noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected 
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or 
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to 
the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, 
etc. 
    "Sheet flow area." See "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or 
greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AC, A1-A30, AE, A99, AR, 
AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, or AH. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and 
means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, 
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty 
(180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent 
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the 
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured 
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, 
grading, and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include 
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it 
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as 
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of 
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, 
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas 
or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of 
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the 
market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new 
development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of 
the structure before the "Start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have 
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, 
however, include either: 
1. ?Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, 
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement 
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2. ?Any alteration of a "Historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction 
in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this 
chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other 
evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that 
documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum 
(NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the 
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated 
areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    "Zone AR" means a special flood hazard area that results from the de-certification of a previously 
accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide a 
100-year or greater level of flood protection.

Article III. - General Provisions 


15.12.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of 
Chino Hills. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) revised January 17, 
1997 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps 
(FBFM5), dated March 18, 1996, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by 
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area 
of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow 
implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain 
Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 2001 Grand Avenue, Chino Hills, California 
91709. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.080 - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without 
full compliance with the term of the ordinance codified in this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection 
with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking 
such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    The ordinance codified in this chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing 
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the ordinance codified in this chapter and 
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the 
more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.100 - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A. ?Considered as minimum requirements; 
B. ?Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C. ?Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory 
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on 
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not 
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free 
from flooding or flood damages This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council, any 
officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any 
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.120 - Severability. 
    The ordinance codified in this chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. 
Should any section of the ordinance codified in this chapter be declared by the courts to be 
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any 
portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


Article IV. - Administration 


15.12.130 - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within 
any area of special flood hazard established in Article III, Section 15.12.070. Application for a 
development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, 
but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and 
elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage 
facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
A. ?Site plan, including but not limited to: 
1. ?For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and twenty (20) foot 
or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one foot contour elevations 
throughout the building site;

Section 15.12.070, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize 
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or 
other source, in order to administer Article V. Any such information shall be submitted to 
the City Council for adoption; or 
2. ?If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, 
then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA 
publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for 
Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to 
administer Article V: 
a. ?Simplified Method.

1. ?Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to 
alteration or relocation; 
2. ?Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency; and 
3. ?Assure that the flood carrying capaCity within the altered or relocated portion of said 
watercourse is maintained. 
D. ?Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make 
available, as needed, the following: 
1. ?Certification required by Article V, Section 15.12.170.C.1 and 15.12.200 (lowest floor 
elevations); 
2. ?Certification required by Article V, Section 15.12.170.C.2 (elevation or flood proofing of 
nonresidential structures); 
3. ?Certification required by Article V, Sections 15.12.170.C.3 (wet floodproofing standard); 
4. ?Certification of elevation required by Article V, Section 15.12.190.B (subdivision standards); 
5. ?Certification required by Article V, Section 15.12.220 (floodway encroachments). 
E. ?Map Determinations Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the 
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a 
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to 
determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location 
of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided 
in Article VI. 
F. ?Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Article III, 
Section 15.12.080. 
G. ?Zone AR Duties. 
1. ?Use the adopted official map or legal description of those designated developed areas 
within Zone AR, AR/AR1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A, or AR/AO as defined in Article II to 
determine if a proposed project is in a developed area. 
2. ?Determine the base flood elevation to be used for individual projects within developed 
areas, areas not designated as developed areas, and dual zone areas (see Article V, 
Section 15.12.230) 
3. ?Require the applicable standards in Article V. 
4. ?Provide written notification to the permit applicant that the area has been designated as a 
Zone AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A and whether the structure will be 
elevated or protected to or above the AR base flood elevation. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.160 - Appeals. 
    The City Council of the City of Chino Hills shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is 
an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the 
enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


Article V. - Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction 


15.12.170 - Standards of construction. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
A. ?Anchoring. 
1. ?All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to 
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic 
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
2. ?All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Article V, Section 
15.12.200. 
B. ?Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be 
constructed:

equipment resistant to flood damage; 
2. ?Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
3. ?With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other 
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or 
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
4. ?Within Zone AH, AO, AR/AH, or AR/AO so that there are adequate drainage paths around 
structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from the proposed structures. 
C. ?Elevation and Flood Proofing. (See Article II definitions for "Basement," "Lowest Floor," "New 
construction," "Substantial damage" and "Substantial improvement".) For Zone AR 
requirements, see Article V, Section 15.12.230. 
I. ?Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, 
including basement: 
a. ?In a Zone AO, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or 
exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two 
feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. (The state of 
California recommends that in Zone AO without veloCity, the lowest floor be elevated 
above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in 
feet on the FIRM by at least two feet, or elevated at least four feet above the highest 
adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.); 
b. ?In a Zone A, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation 
shall be determined by one of the methods in Article IV, Section 15.12.150.B of this 
chapter. (The state of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two 
feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community.); 
c. ?In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. (The state of 
California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base 
flood elevation.) 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including 
basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and 
verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification 
and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

15.12.170.C.1 so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable 
to the passage of water; 
b. ?Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads 
and effects of buoyancy; and 
c. ?Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this 
section (Article V, Section 15.12.170.C.2) are satisfied. Such certification shall be 
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
3. ?All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the 
lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building 
access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically 
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of 
floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA 
Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a. ?Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square 
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all 
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped 
with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit 
the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; or 
b. ?Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
4. ?Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Article V, Section 15.12.200. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.180 - Standards for utilities. 
A. ?All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize 
or eliminate: 
1. ?Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2. ?Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
B. ?On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from 
them during flooding. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.190 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A. ?All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of 
the base flood. 
B. ?All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled 
above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered 
professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
C. ?All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
D. ?All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and 
water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
E. ?All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.200 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A. ?All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE 
on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 
1. ?Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2. ?In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3. ?In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or; 
4. ?In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured 
home has incurred "Substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a 
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or 
above the base flood elevation (the state of California recommends at least two feet above the 
base flood elevation) and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to 
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B. ?All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured 
home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate 
Map that are not subject to the provisions of Article V, Section 15.12.200.A will be securely fastened 
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, lateral movement, and be 
elevated so that either the: 
1. ?Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation (the state of 
California recommends at least two feet above the base flood elevation), or; 
2. ?Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at 
least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall 
be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community 
building-inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the 
Floodplain Administrator. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.210 - Standards for recreational vehicles.

2. ?Meet the permit requirements of Article IV of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring 
requirements for manufactured homes in Article V, Section 15.12.200.A. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.220 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article III, Section 15.12.070 are areas 
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the veloCity of 
floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A. ?Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other 
new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided 
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation 
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B. ?If Article V, Section 15.12.220.A is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and 
other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction 
provisions of Article V. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.230 - Zone AR areas. 
    Within areas designated as Zone AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A as established 
under Article III, Section 15.12.070, the following standards shall apply: 
A. ?Developed Areas. All new construction in areas designated as developed areas shall meet the 
standards of Article V using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that 
is three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
B. ?Areas not Designated as Developed Areas. All new construction in areas that are not 
designated as developed areas: 
1. ?Where the AR flood depth is equal to or less than five feet above the highest adjacent 
grade, shall meet the standards of Article V using the lower of either the AR base flood 
elevation or the elevation that is three feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
2. ?Where the AR flood depth is greater than five feet above the highest adjacent grade, shall 
meet the standards of Article V using the AR base flood elevation. 
C. ?Dual Zone Areas. 
1. ?All new construction in areas within Zone AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A shall 
meet the standards of Article V using the higher of either the applicable Zone AR elevation 
(as determined from Article V, Section 15.12.230.A or B above) or the base flood elevation 
(or flood depth) for the underlying Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A. 
2. ?All substantial improvements to existing construction within Zone AR/A1-30, AR/AE, 
AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A shall meet the standards of Article V using the base flood 
elevation (or flood depth) for the underlying Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


Article VI. - Variance Procedures 


15.12.240 - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning laws that 
variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a 
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this 
chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The 
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique 
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling 
and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances 
from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term 
goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. 
Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple 
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to 
screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.250 - Appeals board. 
A. ?In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all 
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1. ?Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2. ?Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3. ?Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such 
damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4. ?Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5. ?Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable, 
6. ?Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or 
erosion damage; 
7. ?Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8. ?Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area; 
9. ?Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10. ?Expected heights, veloCity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters 
expected at the site; and 
11. ?Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water 
system, and streets and bridges. 
B. ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a 
community official that: 
1. ?The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in 
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars 
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and, 
2. ?Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is 
recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the 
Office of the San Bernardino County Recorder, and shall be recorded in a manner so that it 
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
C. ?The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for 
their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal 
Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 191 § 1 (part), 2006) 


15.12.260 - Conditions for variances. 
A. ?Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other 
proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to, and 
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the 
procedures of Articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases 
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B. ?Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "Historic structures" (as defined in Article II 
of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary 
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C. ?Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels 
during the base flood discharge would result. 
D. ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary," 
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a 
minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to 
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to 
build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which 
the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E. ?Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1. ?Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2. ?Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as 
defined in Article II of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3. ?Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional 
threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Article 
II - see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Article II) of the 
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F. ?Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new 
development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the provisions 
of Article VI, Sections 15.12.260A through E are satisfied, and that the structure or other 
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does 
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
G. ?Upon consideration of the factors of Article VI, Section 15.12.250.A and the purposes of this 
chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems 
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

lines of highways, streets, or alleys, such lines shall be the zone boundaries. In all other cases 
where a district abuts a highway, street, or alley, the zone boundaries shall extend to the 
centerline of the highway, street, or alley. 
B. ?In the case of unsubdivided property where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of the 
boundary, unless the boundary is indicated by dimensions or legal description, shall be 
determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map. 
C. ?Where a public highway, street, or alley, or any portion of such highway, street or alley is 
officially vacated or abandoned, the vacated or abandoned highway, street or alley shall acquire 
the zone classification of the property to which the vacated or abandoned portion reverts. 
D. ?Any submerged lands to be reclaimed by fill for use as a land area shall be prezoned prior to 
City approval of the fill. The prezone shall be consistent with the General Plan. Permitted fill 
activities required in an emergency for the protection of public health or safety shall be exempt

(Ord. 68 § 9.05.030, 1995) 


Chapter 16.06 - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Sections:

    The development standards contained in this chapter are general in nature and apply to all zoning 
districts, unless otherwise indicated. These standards are provided as minimum or maximum standards 
and may be modified by more stringent standards in particular districts and/or due to specific situations. 
The primary intent of this chapter is to provide generally acceptable standards of development for Chino 
Hills.

16.06.020 - Maintenance of properties. 
    All properties within the City shall be kept and maintained in a clean, neat, orderly, operable, and

and any other structures or natural features. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.10.020, 1995) 


16.06.030 - Nuisances. 
    Neither the provisions of this Development Code nor the granting of any permit provided for in this 
Development Code shall authorize or legalize the creation or maintenance of any public or private

16.06.040 - Identification of front lot lines. 
A. ?Single-Family Residential Properties. Occasionally, a lot is adjacent to more than one street. In such 
cases, the following requirements shall be observed in identifying the front lot line. Figure 10-1 
illustrates the following provisions: 
1. ?When a lot exists between two developed lots which both abut the same street, the front lot line 
shall be on the same street as the existing developed lots on either side. 
2. ?When a lot is adjacent to vacant lots or developed lots which abut either street, the following 
criteria shall apply: 
a. ?Where one street is of a higher classification than the other, the lot line fronting the street 
with the lower classification shall be the front lot line. 
b. ?If the lot in question is a corner lot and both streets are of the same classification, the 
narrower of the two frontages shall be designated the front lot line. 
c. ?The Director of Community Development shall make the determination when the above 
criteria cannot be precisely applied to the particular situation as a result of topography or 
other factors by effectuating the intent of these criteria as much as possible. 
3. ?The front lot line for a corner lot or a reverse corner lot is the lot line which fronts the street with 
the lower classification. If both streets are of the same classification, the narrower of the two 
frontages shall be designated the front lot line, except in those cases where the subdivision or 
parcel map specifies another line as the front lot line. 
4. ?The front lot line for a cul-de-sac lot is that lot line which abuts the cul-de-sac street. 
B. ?Multi-Family Residential and Nonresidential Properties. For a multi-family residential or 
nonresidential property with multiple street frontages, the following requirements shall be observed in 
identifying the front lot line: 
1. ?Where one street is of a higher classification than the other, the lot line fronting the street with 
the higher classification shall be the front lot line. 
2. ?If the streets are of the same classification, the widest of the frontages shall be designated the 
front lot line. 
3. ?The Director of Community Development shall make the determination when the above criteria 
cannot be precisely applied to the particular situation as a result of topography or other factors 
by effectuating the intent of these criteria as much as possible.

(Ord. No. 265, § 2(d), 8-27-2013) 


16.06.050 - Determination of front yards and required setbacks. 
A. ?Through Lots. Both frontages of a through lot shall have a minimum setback from both streets of 
twenty (20) feet, unless the provisions of this Development Code allow for reduced non-garage and 
rear setbacks for shallow lots. 
B. ?Key Lots. The depth of the required front yard of a key lot shall not be less than the average depth of 
the street-abutting yards of the adjoining interior and reversed corner lots. The garage portion of the 
primary structure shall require a minimum front yard setback of not less than twenty (20) feet. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.10.050, 1995) 


16.06.060 - Required lot standards reduced by public use. 
A. ?Area. 
1. ?If a portion of a lot or parcel of land is acquired by any means, including dedication, purchase, or 
condemnation for any public use including recreation, services, or utilities, that lot or parcel shall 
be considered conforming as long as the area is reduced to no less than ninety (90) percent of 
the minimum required area for the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located. 
2. ?The Planning Commission shall have the authority to reduce the ninety (90) percent minimum 
required area pursuant to all the conditions and procedures relating to minor variances found in 
Chapter 16.72 of this development code. 
B. ?Width. If a portion of a lot or parcel is acquired by any means, including dedication, purchase, or 
condemnation for any public use which may include recreation, services, or utilities, that lot or parcel 
shall be considered conforming as long as the width is not reduced by more than thirty (30) percent. 
In no case, however, shall a lot less than forty (40) feet in width be considered conforming. 
C. ?Building Setbacks and Lot Coverage. If a portion of a lot or parcel is acquired by any means, 
including dedication, purchase, or condemnation for any public use which may include recreation, 
services, or utilities, that lot or parcel and any structures located on that lot or parcel that were legally 
permitted when constructed shall be considered conforming as to setback and lot coverage 
requirements. In the instance where the setback has been reduced, subsequent improvements to 
that lot or parcel adjacent to the acquired property shall be permitted to adhere to the reduced 
setback in existence on the day of the public use acquisition. In the instance where the maximum lot 
coverage has been increased over that permitted in Chapter 16.10.30 of this development code by 
the reduction in lot size by the public acquisition, subsequent improvements to the lot or parcel shall 
not increase lot coverage by more than five (5) percent beyond the lot coverage in existence upon 
the day of the public use acquisition.

enacted a new § 16.06.070, as set out herein. Former § 16.06.070 pertained to maximum 
projections into yards and derived from Ord. 182 § 3(C), adopted 2005; Ord. 68 § 9.10.070, 
adopted 1995; Ord. No. 225, § 3G, adopted June 9, 2009; Ord. No. 238, § 3(a), adopted July 13, 
2010; Ord. No. 252, § 3(a), adopted January 24, 2012; Ord. No. 255, § 3(d), adopted August 28, 
2012. 


16.06.080 - Clear corner areas for sight visibility. 
A. ?In all zoning districts, a clear corner area for sight visibility purposes shall be provided at the 
intersection of all streets. The required clear corner area shall be determined by using the following 
method: 
1. ?Controlled Intersections. Shall comply with Caltrans Design Manual, Topic 201, "Sight Distance" 
and Topic 405, "Intersection Design Standards." 
2. ?Uncontrolled Intersections. 
a. ?Streets. As illustrated in Figure 10-2, the triangular area of both public and private property 
bounded by the curb lines (or edges of pavement) of the intersecting streets and a 
diagonal line determined by joining points on the curb forty-five (45) feet from the 
intersection of the extended curb lines (or edges of pavement); 
b. ?Driveways. As illustrated in Figure 10-2, the triangular area of both public and private 
property bounded by either the curb lines (or edges of pavement) of the streets, driveway 
edges and a diagonal line determined by joining points on the curb (or edge of pavement), 
and the driveway edge fifteen (15) feet from the intersection of the extended curb lines (or 
edges of pavement) and driveway edge lines;

(Ord. No. 252, § 3(b), 1-24-2012) 


16.06.090 - Right-of-way dedication. 
A. ?Dedication and Improvement. 
1. ?A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any site, building, or structure until all required 
dedications and improvements abutting rights-of-way for the site, building, or structure have 
been made to the ultimate right-of-way shown in the General Plan and as determined by the 
City Engineer. Improvements shall include, but are not limited to, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, 
paving, street trees, traffic improvements, and drainage. All improvements shall be constructed 
to the specifications and in a manner prescribed by the City Engineer. All on-site and off-site 
improvements shall be approved and accepted by the City Engineer prior to issuance of a 
certificate of occupancy. 
2. ?In lieu of dedication, the City Council may accept an irrevocable offer to dedicate and improve. 
Such agreement shall be signed by all persons having any right, title, interest, or lien in the 
property, or any portion of such property, to be dedicated. The signatures on such offer shall be 
acknowledged, and the agreement shall be recorded in the office of the San Bernardino County 
Recorder prior to certificate of occupancy. 
B. ?Exceptions. In cases where the strict application of this Development Code fails to meet community 
objectives as identified in the General Plan, modifications to right-of-way dedication and 
improvement requirements may be authorized by the City Council.

WOOD BURNING: 
 Permits are required for the structure. 
 Two sets of structural calculations and Site Plans are required for plan review. 
 Must be ten (10) feet from structures, not to include fences, walls, or hedges. 
 The termination of the chimney must be two feet above anything within ten (10) feet of the fireplace. 
 The fireplace can only encroach into the setbacks per Table 10-1 and the following: 
NON-WOOD BURNING (decorative only): 
 Permits are required for the structure. 
 A valid ICC legacy report shall be provided for pre-fabricated fireplaces. 
 Installation requirements per manufacture specification. 
 Two copies of the Site Plans are required for plan review. 
 Can be no closer than five feet to any property line. 
 Cannot be over six feet in height within the setbacks. 
C. ?Dedication Standards. Highways, streets, and alleys to be dedicated shall be built to standards as 
established by the Director of Public Works to qualify for dedication. 
D. ?Agreement to Improve. 
1. ?In lieu of the required improvements and if in the best interest of the City, the City Council may 
accept from any responsible party an agreement to make the specified improvements within a 
specified time period. 
2. ?Such agreements shall be accompanied by security deposits which may include cash, 
negotiable bonds, or savings and loan certificates, letters of credit, or other security as 
authorized by the City Engineer. The security deposit shall equal the cost of the agreed upon 
improvements. Where savings and loan certificates or deposits are deposited, the owners 
thereof shall assign the certificates to the City and administration adjusted for inflation as 
determined by the City Engineer. Such deposit and assignment shall be subject to and in 
compliance with the provisions and conditions of the municipal Development Code of the City. 
3. ?If the estimated cost of the improvements equals or exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) 
the applicant may file a corporate surety bond with the City in lieu of the deposit. Such corporate 
surety bond shall guarantee the adequate completion of all of the improvements in a penal sum 
equal to the estimated cost. 
4. ?In cases where the stipulated time within which improvements were to be made expires, the City 
Council may grant additional time as it considers appropriate. Granting of additional time shall 
include recalculation of improvement costs and security deposits. The extension must be 
granted prior to expiration of the time limit. 
5. ?Should the responsible person fail to complete any improvement within the agreed upon time, 
the City Council may determine that the agreed upon improvement is incomplete and may 
cause a portion of the deposit or surety bond to be forfeited to the City to complete or correct 
the work. Such forfeiture shall not exceed the amount required to complete the agreed upon 
work and expenses incurred by the City as a result of the default. Not less than ten (10) days 
prior to such a determination, the City shall serve the person with written notice. If the written 
notice is delivered by mail, it must be sent by certified mail and shall be served not less than 
twenty (20) days prior to the determination. If after ten (10) days the City has not received the 
return receipt or the letter is returned to the City "refused," the notice shall be sent by regular 
first class U.S. mail and a declaration of mailing completed and filed. 
E. ?Adequate Rights-of-Way. The City Council may grant a modification to the provisions of this section, 
thereby relieving the applicant from compliance with all or a portion of the provisions of this section, 
subject to the following findings: 
1. ?That relieving or partially relieving the applicant's development from providing the required 
dedications and improvements is consistent with the General Plan and the best interest of the 
City; and 
2. ?The required improvements are included in a budgeted City project which will be complete prior 
to the start of the applicant's development or within an approved assessment district and the 
improvement can be more effectively provided by the City; or 
3. ?The required construction would create a temporary drainage or traffic problem that can be 
avoided by delaying the improvement to a later date as part of comprehensive improvements to 
the area; or 
4. ?The City Engineer determines current improvements to be satisfactory. 
    All requests for modifications shall be made in the form of a major Variance application, as specified 
in Chapter 16.70. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.10.090, 1995) 


16.06.100 - Measurement of building height. 
    The maximum height limits for buildings or any other type of structure are described in Title 16 for 
each of the individual zoning districts. Height shall be measured from the grade plane (as defined in 
Section 16.02.190) to the highest point of the structure (as defined in Section 16.02.310), including 
mechanical equipment (as defined in Section 16.02.250), architectural projection(s) (as defined in Section 
16.02.130), architectural roof screening, and appurtenance structure(s) (as defined in Section 16.02.130). 
(Ord. 68 § 9.10.100, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 225, § 3F, 6-9-2009) 


16.06.110 - Landscaping. 
    Landscaping shall be provided and maintained as required by and outlined in the City of Chino Hills 
Landscape Manual and other applicable policies. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.10.110, 1995) 


16.06.120 - Fences, walls, and hedges. 
A. ?The maximum height of all fences, walls, and hedges for all zoning districts in the City is as follows: 
1. ?Single-family residential zones and single-family residential uses in the PD district: 
a. ?Required front yardFour feet maximum. 
b. ?Required sides and rear yardSix feet maximum. 
2. ?Multi-family residential zones and multi-family residential uses in PD district: 
a. ?Required front yardFour feet maximum, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a six-
foot maximum is permitted on condition that the portion of the fence or wall projecting 
above three feet, excluding pilasters, shall be an open material (e.g. tubular steel) or 
transparent material (e.g. acrylic). 
b. ?Required sides and rear yardSix feet maximum. 
3. ?Non-residential Zoning Districts and non-residential uses in the PD district: 
a. ?Required front yardFour feet maximum. 
b. ?Required sides and rear yardNine feet maximum. 
    The overall height of the wall or fence shall be measured from the highest point of the wall or fence 
to the lowest adjacent grade. (For further requirements regarding retaining and crib walls and height 
within required front yard, see subsections B and C of this section.) 
    All walls and fences shall complement the architectural style of the development within which they 
are located. All walls and fences shall be designed to be decorative, including architectural 
embellishments, whenever visible from any street and/or from common areas within a development. 
    All walls and fences shall be constructed of durable materials such as masonry, masonry 
combination, stone, brick, concrete, wrought iron (tubular steel), or other type of material as may be 
approved by the Planning Commission or the Community Development Director for durability, aesthetics, 
and sound attenuation purposes. No wood fencing shall be permitted; this provision prohibiting the use of 
wood fencing is not applicable to fencing used as part of multi-purpose trails or existing wood fencing that 
is part of a common fence between existing neighbors. No chain-link fencing is permitted in front or street 
facing side or rear yards, except that chain-link fencing that was installed prior to November 24, 2015, 
shall be considered legal non-conforming structures. No barbed wire, razor ribbon, or other similar 
material shall be permitted as a wall or fencing material, except in undeveloped Agriculture Ranch or 
Open Space areas as required to restrict cattle movement, or on utilities or other public facilities required 
to provide security. 
B. ?Retaining and Crib Walls. The heights of any portion of wall or fence, which retains earth or water, 
except in the required front yard, shall be limited as follows. The height of the wall shall not include 
any guardrail or open fence (defined in subsection (C)(4) of this section) required by the California 
Building Code or the City. 
1. ?Walls Built on Prominent Knolls and Ridgelines and in the Carbon Canyon Area. For walls 
constructed in the areas defined in Section 16.08.050(B) of this Code, the wall shall be limited 
to a height of four feet. However, upon approval of a minor Variance pursuant to Chapter 16.72 
of this Development Code, a height of up to five feet may be permitted for walls visible from a 
public street, and a height of up to eight feet may be permitted for walls not visible from a public 
street. "Visible" shall be defined by the Director of Community Development. 
2. ?Alternative to Height Limit of Retaining Walls. Stepping of retaining walls is permitted provided 
that the minimum horizontal distance between the top of the down slope retaining wall and/or 
fence, and the bottom of the up slope retaining wall and/or fence, shall be equal to the vertical 
height of the down slope retaining wall, and/or fence. Crib block walls and any areas that are 
created by stepping of the walls are required to be screened with landscaping. 
    Any guardrails required by the Building Official shall be open-type guardrails, and the rail shall 
be exempted from maximum allowable height measurements. Crib walls with a vertical slope of at 
least one-half to one are exempt from stepping and maximum wall height requirements. 
C. ?Height Within the Required Front Yard. 
1. ?The clear corner areas for sight visibility requirements contained in Section 16.06.080 shall 
apply. 
2. ?Fences, whether solid, open, or transparent, with the exception of subsection (C)(3) of this 
section, shall not exceed four feet in height. 
3. ?Brick or concrete pilasters used in conjunction with approved fencing materials are permitted. 
Pilasters and gates as part of a fence are allowed to project above the maximum height of a 
fence per Section 16.06.070, Table 10-1. 
4. ?Open fence material shall not exceed two inches in width nor be spaced less than four inches 
apart. 
5. ?The height of retaining walls in the front yard shall be equal to or less than four feet in height. 
The total height of any wall in a front yard, including a retaining portion, shall be equal to or less 
than four feet in height. 
D. ?Fences or walls shall provide a gate or other suitable opening no less than thirty (30) inches in width 
to provide access to primary or accessory structures. 
E. ?Fences which were legally constructed prior to the adoption of this Development Code, but made 
nonconforming as a result of the adoption of the Development Code, are exempt from amortization. 
(Ord. 194 §3 (part), 2007: Ord. 112 § 2, 1998; Ord. 68 § 16.06.120, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 225, § 3A, 6-9-2009; Ord. No. 261, § 3(a), 1-8-2013; Ord. No. 280, § 3, 12-9-2014; 
Ord. No. 293, § 6, 11-24-2015) 


16.06.130 - General design compatibility and enhancement. 
A. ?Any new building or structure, any addition to an existing building or structure, and installation or 
construction of any site improvements shall be designed to create a unified functional and 
comprehensive Site Plan. The improvements shall have an integrated architectural theme that is 
compatible with and will complement and enhance the subject and surrounding properties, as 
determined by the Community Development Director or designee. 
B. ?Any new single family dwelling or addition to an existing single family dwelling that creates or 
modifies a second story element, shall be designed to complement and enhance the subject and 
surrounding properties and to have appropriate treatments for second story elements oriented 
towards a street including front, side, and rear elevations that provide visual relief and avoid an 
uninterrupted flat wall from ground floor to second story, as determined by the Community 
Development Director or designee. 
C. ?Single-family detached residential development in all residential districts and for all residential uses 
in a PD district or an existing PD shall be subject to design review as set forth in Section 16.10.050, 
Residential design guidelines, of this Code, prior to or concurrently with: (1) approval of a tentative 
tract or parcel map pursuant to the division of land uses proceeding in Appendix D of this Code, (2) 
approval of a preliminary development plan pursuant to Chapter 16.74 of this Code, (3) approval of a 
final development plan pursuant to Chapter 16.74 of this Code, or (4) submittal of architectural plans 
for the issuance of any building permits (with the exception of grading permits, which may be issued 
prior to the completion of the design review process), at the landowner's option. For residential 
subdivisions which have been subdivided by a master builder or developer for the purpose of 
constructing a unified subdivision, new units constructed within that subdivision shall be compatible 
in design with the units constructed during the earlier phases. (See also Chapter 16.20, Planned

16.07.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    This chapter is adopted in accordance with Government Code Section 65595(c) for the purpose of 
complying with California law and promoting water conservation. The intent and purpose of this chapter is 
to: 
1. ?Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the 
conservation and efficient use of water; 
2. ?Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water 
efficient landscapes in new construction, and rehabilitated projects, by encouraging the use of a 
watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and 
property owners to achieve the many benefits possible; 
3. ?Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing 
landscapes; 
4. ?Use water efficiently without waste by setting a Maximum Applied Water Allowance (MAWA) as 
an upper limit for water use, and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount without a 
decline in the quality or quantity of landscapes; 
5. ?Create the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic 
matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more 
carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits; 
6. ?Conserve water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and 
selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment; 
and 
7. ?Protect existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate 
adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants.

16.08.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The City of Chino Hills derives much of its character from its hillside setting and its diverse 
topographic forms. The City's General Plan emphasizes preservation and enhancement of the natural 
features which contribute to the scenic qualities. The general hillside design regulations contained in this 
chapter are to be used in conjunction with the grading regulations contained in Chapter 16.50 and in the 
City's Landscape Manual. The purpose of these regulations is to protect and enhance the unique visual 
resources of Chino Hills. This chapter was completed with the best information available, but is not 
inclusive, and may be modified as appropriate with new information. 
(Ord. 121 § 2 (part), 1999) 


16.08.020 - Applicability. 
A. ?General Provisions. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all hillside areas within the City, 
except as specifically exempted in subsection C of this section. For the purposes of this chapter, 
"hillside area" means all properties in the City which have a natural slope of fifteen (15) percent on 
any existing or proposed parcel that is proposed for development. The provisions of this chapter

(Ord. 121 § 2 (part), 1999) 


16.08.030 - Important visual resources defined. 
    Figure 15-1 highlights the important visual resources in Chino Hills. These resources generally are 
visible at important gateways into the City, from its major transportation corridors/thoroughfares (SR 71, 
SR 142, arterials, and collector streets). The resources shown on Figure 15-1 are not considered to be 
more important than other viewpoints, but rather they are the locations from which a large number of 
people will visually interpret the City. In many cases, the major transportation corridors/thoroughfares 
provide the only access to significant views. The important visual resources are defined as follows: 
A. ?Exceptionally Prominent Ridgelines. Ridgelines that, by virtue of their scale, mass, and visual 
presence form the limits of the most exceptional viewsheds of the City, and are typically four 
hundred (400) feet above their associated primary view point(s). Those that provide the City 
with its distinct image and serve as the City's most recognizable skyline backdrop when viewed 
from the following transportation corridors/thoroughfares: 
1. ?Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71); 
2. ?Carbon Canyon Road (SR 142); 
3. ?Butterfield Ranch Road; 
4. ?Soquel Canyon Parkway; 
5. ?Chino Hills Parkway; 
6. ?Peyton Drive; 
7. ?Woodview Road; 
8. ?Eucalyptus Avenue; 
9. ?Tonner Canyon Road; and 
10. ?Grand Avenue. 
B. ?Prominent Ridgelines. Ridgelines that form the limits of significant viewsheds and provide a 
natural backdrop when viewed from primary view point(s). Although they vary considerably in 
scale, width, scope, length, alignment, accessibility, and relationship to adjacent land uses, they 
are typically two hundred (200) feet above their associated primary view point(s). 
C. ?Prominent Knolls. A highly visible hill or hilltop which provides a point of orientation or reference 
for the observer. It is generally a feature of significance within an area, rather than one of 
community-wide importance. 
D. ?Associated Primary View Point. A specifically designated location from which a specific 
ridgeline may be viewed. Primary view points for any given ridgeline are selected as points from 
which large numbers of people are likely to be able to view the ridgeline. 
(Ord. 121 § 2 (part), 1999) 


16.08.040 - Ridgeline protection requirements. 
A. ?Areas Where Development is Prohibited. 
1. ?Exceptionally Prominent Ridgelines. (Fig. 15-1.a) The exceptionally prominent ridgelines 
identified on Figure 15-1 shall not be developed. A minimum separation of one hundred (100) 
vertical feet shall be provided from the crest of the ridgeline to the area where development is to 
be allowed (the "crest" is defined as the top of the ridgeline). The exceptionally prominent 
ridgelines shall be retained in a natural, undisturbed condition. No construction activity, except 
grading for geotechnical purposes or roadways, shall be allowed to occur within one hundred 
(100) vertical feet of the crest of any exceptionally prominent ridgeline. 

 
2. ?Prominent Ridgelines. (Fig. 15-1.b) The prominent ridgelines identified on Figure 15-1 shall not 
be developed. No construction activity, except grading for geotechnical purposes or roadways, 
shall be allowed to occur within one hundred (100) feet of both sides of the crest of a prominent 
ridgeline (the crest is defined as the top of the ridgeline). In addition to this one hundred (100) 
foot horizontal setback on both sides of the ridgeline, no construction activity, except grading for 
geotechnical purposes or roadways, or the building envelope, shall be allowed to occur within 
thirty-five (35) vertical feet from the crest of the ridgeline. 

 
Figure 15-1.b
3. ?Prominent Knolls. The prominent knolls identified on Figure 15-1 shall not be developed. No 
construction activity, except grading for geotechnical purposes and roadways, shall be allowed 
to occur within one hundred (100) horizontal feet of the crest of the prominent knoll and thirty-
five (35) vertical feet from the crest. 
(Ord. 121 § 2 (part), 1999) 


16.08.050 - Hillside adaptive development standards.

B. ?Development in areas referenced in subsection (A)(4) of this section shall conform to the following 
hillside adaptive development standards. 
1. ?Projects shall incorporate clustering, variable setbacks, multiple orientations, and other Site 
Planning techniques to avoid the appearance of a solid line of development. 
2. ?All buildings shall be hillside adaptive, meaning that the basic structure shall conform to the 
natural topography. The Development Code requirement of a fifteen (15) foot usable rear yard 
may be waived by the Community Development Director on a case-by-case basis. 
3. ?Development shall not be terraced to accommodate flat-pad construction in areas where the line 
slope of the existing, natural terrain exceeds fifteen (15) percent. 
4. ?Retaining walls, a maximum of thirty-six (36) inches above the natural or rough grade, may be 
used to create usable yard space in the side and rear yard. Retaining walls in the exposed side 
and downhill portions of a lot shall be screened with appropriate landscaping materials (i.e., fire 
resistive, erosion-controlling, or decorative). 
5. ?Local and restricted local street standards shall be utilized where safety and circulation 
considerations permit. Elimination of sidewalks, use of common driveways, slope 
encroachments into the right-of-way, flexible centerline gradients, and other techniques to 
minimize landform alteration should be considered. 
6. ?The building envelope for all structures shall be as follows: 
a. ?Downhill Lots. A ten (10) foot minimum front setback; twelve (12) foot height at setback 
extending up and towards the rear of the lot at forty-five (45) degrees to twenty-five (25) 
feet total height; thirty (30) foot height limit over sloping portions measured from finish 
grade; and fifteen (15) foot minimum rear setback. Figure 15-2 illustrates the building 
envelope for downhill lots. 
 
Figure 15-2.
b. ?Uphill Lots. A ten (10) foot minimum front setback; twelve (12) foot height at setback 
extending up and towards the rear of the lot at forty-five (45) degrees to a maximum height 
of thirty-five (35) feet measured from finish grade; and fifteen (15) foot minimum rear 
setback. 

 
Figure 15-3.
c. ?Cross Slope Lots. Similar requirements as for uphill and downhill lots, except that height at 
front setback may be averaged across frontage inside the side yard setbacks. 

 
Figure 15-4.
d. ?Sideyard Exception. A zero setback is permitted where dwellings on contiguous lots are 
attached. 
e. ?Exceptions. Where attached clustered housing is being developed, building height 
limitations may be increased. For uphill and downhill lots, the maximum height is twelve 
(12) feet at the setback, extending up and towards the rear of the lot at forty-five (45) 
degrees to twenty-eight (28) feet of total height, with a thirty-five (35) foot height limit over 
sloping portions measured from finish grade. 
f. ?Facade Treatment. Where attached clustered housing is being developed, the facade 
extending up or down the slope shall not appear as a single, rigid vertical element but shall 
include variations in roof lines and elevations, using variable architectural detail to soften 
large vertical surfaces.

16.08.060 - Architectural guidelines for hillside development. 
    The following architectural guidelines shall apply to all structures and development located in the 
areas defined in Section 16.08.050 of this chapter. 
A. ?The form, mass, and profile of the individual buildings and architectural features shall be 
designed to blend with the natural terrain and preserve the character and profile of the ridgeline 
or knoll. Some techniques which should be considered include: 
1. ?Split pads, stepped footings, and grade separations to permit dwellings to cascade down or 
step up the natural slope; 
2. ?Detaching parts of a dwelling such as the garage; 
3. ?Low profiles or flat rooflines oriented in the same direction as the natural slope; 
4. ?Figures 15-15 and 15-16 illustrate these techniques. 
B. ?Building materials and color schemes shall blend with the natural landscape. Treated wood or 
material of a wood-like appearance, having the necessary fire retardant characteristics 
(consistent with the requirements of the applicable fire overlay zone), are encouraged for 
exterior surfaces. Where exterior stucco is used, it shall have a final coat of integrated color in a 
muted earth tone. Contrast color accents shall be kept to a minimum, particularly on the view 
side. Roof colors shall also be earth tones.

16.09.030 - Photographic examples. 
    The Community Development Department - Planning Division shall maintain a photographic data 
base of examples of commercial, industrial, and institutional projects which exemplify the guidelines 
contained herein. 
(Ord. No. 226, § 4, 7-14-2009) 


16.09.040 - Site planning guidelines. 
A. ?Relationship to Surrounding Properties. 
1. ?Relate the location of site uses with adjoining properties to avoid possible conflicts and ensure 
compatibility. 
2. ?Consider sharing access with adjoining properties where feasible. 
3. ?Provide a buffer where a site adjoins residential development such as increased setbacks, 
limiting the height of buildings, or providing dense landscaping. 
B. ?Building Placement. 
1. ?Plot buildings to create plazas and logical pedestrian connections. 
2. ?For multiple buildings, vary placement to avoid parking areas that dominate the streetscape. 
3. ?Avoid a "strip commercial" appearance where buildings are plotted in a straight row with parking 
along the entire street frontage. 
C. ?Access and Circulation. 
1. ?Align access with existing driveways, intersections, or median openings whenever reasonably 
possible. 
2. ?Locate driveways as far from intersections as possible (a recommended minimum distance is 
three hundred (300) feet). 
3. ?Provide a minimum two points of vehicle ingress and egress. 
4. ?Design the circulation system to address the needs of both motorists and pedestrians. Avoid a 
design that creates vehicle (including emergency vehicle)/pedestrian conflicts. 
5. ?Create a distinct entry statement with enhanced pavement or other enhancements at project 
entrances. The enhanced pavement shall be designed to support the weight of the fire 
department apparatus (minimum sixty-seven thousand (67,000) pounds). Additionally, 
circulation shall take into consideration the fire department apparatus turning radii. 
6. ?Provide proper vehicle stacking distance at driveway entrances. 
7. ?Maintain adequate sight lines for motorists at intersections and driveways through careful 
placement of signs and landscaping.

2. ?Screen parking areas along the street frontage with berms, landscaping, low walls, grade 
differentials, and building orientation. 
3. ?Distribute parking areas evenly throughout a project. Avoid creating isolated parking areas that 
are not easily accessible to buildings. 
4. ?Avoid dead-end parking aisles. 
5. ?Wherever traffic requirements allow it, install pervious surfaces that allow storm water 
infiltration. Use impervious pavement (concrete and asphalt) only where regular car, bus or 
truck traffic is expected. Match the surface to the need: 
 ?Porous asphalt, paver blocks or large aggregate concrete for parking and highly used 
bicycle and pedestrian areas (excluding drive aisle/fire lane). 
 ?Lattice blocks that permit grass growth for fire lanes subject to approval by the Chino Valley 
Independent Fire District and overflow parking. 
 ?Crushed stone, decomposed granite or brick for lightly used pedestrian paths. 
6. ?Provide shade trees in parking areas with a minimum of five foot square of planting wells. 
Shade trees shall be of sufficient size and be distributed throughout the entire parking area. 
E. ?Loading Areas. 
1. ?Orient loading areas and truck bays away from the street. Where it is necessary for loading 
areas and truck bays to face a street, screen them with buildings, walls, enclosures, or 
landscaping materials that matures quickly, or is of larger specimen sizes. 
2. ?Where loading areas or truck bays are adjacent to residential areas, consider increasing 
building setbacks, providing wider planter areas for dense landscaping, plant landscaping 
materials that matures quickly, or is of larger specimen sizes. 
3. ?Location of loading areas shall not impede the fire department access. 
F. ?Location of On-Site Ancillary Structures (above ground utilities, trash enclosures, vapor recovery 
systems, etc.). 
1. ?Design trash enclosures to be compatible with the architectural style of the project. 
2. ?Include a trellis on all trash enclosures visible to the public (i.e. from public streets, areas in the 
front and sides of buildings).

enclosure service gates. 
4. ?Screen ground mounted equipment and utilities to the maximum extent feasible. 
5. ?Use decorative bollards to protect ancillary structures. 
6. ?Try to avoid locating above ground utilities in front yard setback areas or adjacent to major 
streets. Any above ground utilities that are required to be installed in the required front yard 
setback areas or adjacent to major streets shall be screened with landscaping provided that 
there is adequate clearance around the fire department backflow prevention devices or fire 
department connection per the Chino Valley Independent Fire District standards. 
7. ?Shopping cart storage area that is required as part of the building exterior or within the parking 
lot shall be designed in a manner that would complement the architecture of the building or the 
shopping center.

16.09.050 - Architectural guidelines. 
A. ?Elevations. 
1. ?Provide architectural treatment to all elevations (i.e., three hundred sixty-degree architecture). 
2. ?Design rear elevations to be visually attractive by providing articulation to the building plane, 
and vertical variation of the roofline. Should the rear doors of the buildings are visible from a 
public right(s)-of-way, the doors must be screened with a combination of trellis and landscaping 
or other design elements to minimized view impacts. 
3. ?Avoid expanses of blank wall, devoid of any articulation or embellishment. 
4. ?For "in-line shops", complement the architectural style by providing interest and variation. 
Design elements to be considered are providing offsets or bays, strong base material (e.g. 
stone, brick, tile etc.), variation of storefront treatment, and use of multi-pane windows. 
5. ?Architectural details can introduce accent colors; however, avoid too many bright colors which 
overpower the building. 
6. ?Paint roll-up doors and service doors to blend-in with main building colors. 
7. ?Articulate building entrances to create a formal entry statement. 
8. ?Provide focal points in the architectural theme to create strong entry statements and provide a 
sense of place. Towers, domes, massing, color, trellises, fountains, public art, and plazas are 
encouraged. 
9. ?Vary the roof through the use of vertical separations, varying roof structure, varying the parapet 
line or ridge line. Depending upon the parapet height, fire department access may be required 
for emergency personnel. 
10. ?Provide a covered structure (i.e. Porte-cochere) over the pick-up/drop-off window area for 
drive-through businesses. The structure is to be an integral part of the main building 
architectural design. If the building is to be equipped with an automatic fire sprinkler system, the 
covered structure shall also be protected. 
11. ?Enclose downspouts, roof drains, roof ladders and other similar features within the building. 
12. ?Provide window treatment such as awnings or hard canopies that extend a sufficient distance 
from the face of the storefront or building façade so that they function as an architectural 
feature. 
B. ?Massing and Scale. 
1. ?Make buildings that are at the maximum allowed height to be less imposing by physically 
stepping them back from the street level. 
2. ?Give special attention to creating pedestrian scale and an inviting place for pedestrians to shop. 
C. ?Comprehensive Design. 
1. ?Consider site amenities, such as walls, hardscape, site furniture, trash enclosures, lighting, and 
monument signs, as part of the total architectural package for the project. 
D. ?Screening. 
1. ?Integrate screening for roof mounted equipment into the building design (i.e., extend the height 
of parapet walls and/or painting the equipment to match the roof color) to screen the equipment 
from public view. 
2. ?Screen drive-thru lanes from public view to the maximum extent feasible through building 
orientation and/or the use of a combination of landscaping, berming, and low screen walls. 
3. ?Completely screen long-term shopping cart storage areas as part of the building design. 
(Ord. No. 226, § 4, 7-14-2009) 


16.09.060 - Landscaping guidelines. 
1. ?Locate plants in conjunction with architectural design and Site Planning. Plants can be used to 
keynote entries, contrast with or reinforce building lines and volumes, and soften hard lines or blank 
wall expanses. 
2. ?Provide shade trees in parking areas with a minimum of five foot square of planting wells. Shade 
tress shall be of sufficient size and be distributed throughout the entire parking area. 
3. ?Provide special landscaping treatment, such as intensifying the density (size and/or number) of 
trees, accent trees, and special paving, at all project entries and building entrances. Do not place 
landscaping in such a manner that current or future visibility or ingress/egress is blocked. 
4. ?Use generous landscaping to define outdoor spaces such as the street edge, outdoor plazas, or 
movement paths between parking and building entrances. 
5. ?Provide dense landscaping to screen unattractive views and features, such as parking lots, loading 
and storage areas, trash enclosures, utility equipment (i.e., transformers, meters, backflow valves), 
and air conditioning units. Note: Above ground pressure detector assemblies, backflow prevention 
assemblies, and private fire service assemblies that INCLUDE a fire department connection shall 
NOT BE screened. 
6. ?Provide a landscape area against buildings and walls where practical to avoid "hard edges" (i.e. 
where paving meets buildings or walls). 
7. ?Do not place landscaping in such a manner that current and future visibility of building signage or 
ingress/egress is blocked. 
8. ?Tree placement and type shall be strategically placed to avoid conflict with parking lot lighting and 
on-site utilities. 
(Ord. No. 226, § 4, 7-14-2009) 


16.09.070 - Lighting guidelines. 
1. ?Parking lot lighting poles and fixtures should complement the overall site architecture and design in 
terms of scale, color, and style. 
2. ?Parking lot light shall be shielded when the project is located adjacent to residential development or 
zone(s). 
3. ?Use decorative light sconces for all exterior building lights. Wall Packs are not permitted. 
(Ord. No. 226, § 4, 7-14-2009) 


16.09.080 - Sign guidelines. 
1. ?The building itself can serve to identify the business through use of a logo and color schemes. In 
such cases, additional signs on the facade should be limited. 
2. ?Use signs as a means of business identification rather than as a form of advertising. 
3. ?Select colors and materials which complement the architecture, including monument signs. 
Monument signs shall have the same architectural theme as the primary architecture of the 
development. 
4. ?Size of signs must be proportional to the scale of the building and the surface they are affixed to. 
5. ?Visually balance the sign area with the building mass and height rather than designing to the 
maximum standard. 
6. ?Consider the layout and shape of the architectural features of the building. Design elements such as 
window patterns (vertical and horizontal rectangles, arches, squares, etc.) will help determine the 
sign shape that will suit the building. 
7. ?A Comprehensive Sign Program for all multi-tenant projects is required to create a coordinated 
project theme of uniform design elements, such as color, lettering style, and placement. 
(Ord. No. 226, § 4, 7-14-2009)

Chapter 16.10 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
Sections: 


16.10.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A. ?The intent of this chapter is to create, preserve, and enhance residential areas for a wide range of 
housing types and lifestyles. These regulations are directed toward encouraging quality development 
and integrated, attractive residential neighborhoods. Toward this end, six residential districts are 
established. For each district, the City has established a density limit, measured in gross acres. No 
entitlement for the maximum allowable density is granted by this Development Code. The actual 
density achieved on a development site will be based upon factors to include, but not be limited to, 
topography, access, availability of utilities and other infrastructure, proximity to sensitive 
environmental resources, availability of public services, viewshed considerations, etc. 
B. ?The following residential land use districts are established in Chino Hills: 
1. ?Agriculture-Ranch (R-A). The agriculture-ranch (R-A) zone district provides for the preservation 
of large lot residential uses with related agricultural operations. The minimum lot size is five (5) 
acres, yielding a maximum density of 0.2 units per acre. In addition to the primary residential 
use, permitted accessory uses include equestrian facilities, agricultural uses, and cattle grazing. 
Both public and private stables and related uses are allowed as accessory uses. Minimum lot 
sizes in this zoning district may be increased depending on terrain, availability of services, or 
other factors; if modified, the minimum lot size shall be shown on the Zoning Map. 
2. ?Rural Residential (R-R). The rural residential (R-R) zone district is a single-family zone which 
permits residential development on very large lots, with a minimum lot size of one half acres 
(maximum density two units per gross acre). Minimum lot sizes in this zoning district may be

(Ord. 163 § 3(D), 2004; Ord. 142 §§ 2, 3, 2001; Ord. 112 § 6, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.20.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 12, 11-24-2015; Ord. No. 299, § 7, 6-14-2016; Ord. No. 321, § 8, 11-28-2017; 
Ord. No. 337, § 4, 4-9-2019) 


16.10.025 - Accessory lot temporary structures and uses. 
A. ?The purpose of this accessory lot section is to establish a temporary use permit process to enable a 
homeowner within designated areas of the small lot overlay to expand their useable outdoor area to 
an adjacent undeveloped lot for limited passive uses. 
B. ?This section applies to undeveloped residentially zoned single-family lots within the following tracts 
of the R-S Small Lot Overlay Zone as governed by Section 16.32.010 of the Municipal Code. These 
tracts are included within this section because they are located in canyon areas of the City which are 
further constrained by varied topography and limited vehicular access: 
?The Canon Lane area, including: 
??Tract 1913 
??Tract 1945 
?The Sleepy Hollow area, including: 
??Tract 1868 
??Tract 2037 
??Tract 2211 
??Tract 2358 
??The "Carbon Canyon Tract" 
??The "Sleepy Hollow Tract" 
C. ?For the purposes of this section, "primary lot" is defined as the property that contains a single-family 
residential dwelling and is owned and occupied by the applicant owner of the accessory lot. For the 
purposes of this section, "accessory lot" is defined as the adjacent undeveloped lot on which the 
owner of the "primary lot" has applied to operate a limited passive use for a temporary period. 
D. ?For the purposes of this section only, "adjacent" means no further than fifty (50) feet between the 
accessory lot and primary lot, measured property line to property line. 
E. ?Uses permitted on the accessory lot shall be limited to passive recreational or horticultural uses. 
Passive recreational uses include play areas consisting of grass or ground cover areas, swing sets 
and slides, and play houses. Horticultural uses include gardening areas that include decorative 
plants, fruits and vegetables and trees compliant with the City Tree Ordinance (Chapter 16.90 of the 
Municipal Code). All horticultural uses shall be conducted outdoors. 
F. ?The Community Development Director, and Planning Commission and Council on appeal, in acting 
to approve an application under this section, may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary to 
ensure the use is consistent with the General Plan, compatible with surrounding land use, and meets 
the provisions and intent of this Development Code. In making such a determination, the following 
findings must be made: 
1. ?That the proposed use is consistent with the General Plan; 
2. ?That the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings, and structures have 
been considered, and that the use will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to these 
adjacent uses, buildings, or structures; 
3. ?That the site for the proposed use is of adequate size and shape to accommodate the use and 
structures proposed; 
4. ?That the proposed use and structures comply with all applicable development standards of the 
zoning district; and 
5. ?That the proposed use observes the spirit and intent of this Development Code. 
G. ?Maximum height of play equipment such as slides and swing sets shall be eight (8) feet from 
adjacent grade or floor elevation. 
H. ?Maximum height of play houses shall be five (5) feet from adjacent grade or floor elevation and 
maximum area shall be thirty (30) square feet in size with a maximum of two (2) play houses. For the 
purposes of this section, "play house" is defined as an open temporary structure intended for the 
sole use of child daytime play, with openings on all sides that must remain clear of any coverings or 
locks so that the interior of the play house remains viewable from the outside at all times. 
I. ?Maximum height of sheds shall be four (4) feet from adjacent grade or floor elevation and maximum 
area shall be twenty (20) square feet in size with a maximum of two (2) sheds. For the purposes of 
this section, "shed" is defined as an enclosed temporary structure used primarily for storage. 
J. ?No equipment shall be stored on the accessory lot unless fully contained in the shed structure(s). 
K. ?No vehicles shall be stored on the accessory lot. 
L. ?No dirt piles shall be permitted on the accessory lot. 
M. ?No grading or paving shall be permitted on the accessory lot. 
N. ?No electrical or mechanical equipment shall be permitted on the accessory lot. 
O. ?No hazardous materials, fires, barbeques or other uses or structures deemed by the Chino Valley 
Fire District and/or the Community Development Director to be a potential fire hazard shall be 
permitted on the accessory lot. 
P. ?At no time shall the accessory lot be used for habitation including nighttime use or sleeping. 
Q. ?All structures on the accessory lot shall be subject to the development standards of the small lot 
overlay, including setback requirements. 
R. ?All structures on the accessory lot shall be subject to City Building Permits, including applicable fire 
resistant code requirements. 
S. ?Use of an accessory lot shall be subject to a Temporary Use Permit (Chapter 16.80 of the Municipal 
Code), and valid for a period of five years unless the applicant applies for, and the Community 
Development Director approves, an extension for a maximum period of five years. 
T. ?A deed restriction in a form acceptable to the City Attorney shall be required to tie the ownership, 
use, maintenance and sale of the accessory lot to the primary lot for the duration of the accessory 
use. 
(Ord. No. 337, § 4, 4-9-2019) 


16.10.030 - Development standards. 
A. ?Table 20-1(A) sets forth the development standards that all residential units in the residential zone 
districts must comply with, except for residential uses in the Planned Development District or in a PD 
or in R-S-1 Residential Zone District. For the applicable minimum standards for residential uses in 
the Planned Development district, see Chapter 16.20. For additional standards for residential lots 
within legal subdivisions in the small lot overlay districts as identified on the City of Chino Hills 
Zoning Map, see Section 16.10.090. For R-S-1 Residential Zone District see Subsection D below. 
B. ?A copy of the Table 20-1(A), as amended by Ordinance 112 is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and 
incorporated in this chapter. 
C. ?Notwithstanding subsection A and B § 16.10.030 above, clustering is permitted for certain 
designated properties to protect environmental and visual resources. As an alternative to the 
development standards set forth in Exhibit "A" Table 20-1(A), designated properties within the R-A 
and R-R zone identified in Figure 20-1B may apply to have the clustering standards set forth in 
Exhibit "B" Table 20-1(B). Applications for clustering apply through and comply with the requirements 
of the site plan review process (Chapter 16.76) and the additional following requirements. 
1. ?Applications to cluster must clearly demonstrate that clustering results in: 
i. ?Reduced grading; 
ii. ?Reduced roadways and driveway intrusions into sensitive habitat areas, open space, and 
the Chino Hills State Park; 
iii. ?Protection of increased amounts of open space; and 
iv. ?Protection of environmental and visual resources. 
D. ?The development standards for R-S-1 Residential Zone District is set forth in Exhibit "C" Table 20-
1(C).

16.10.040 - Minimum residential design standards. 
    The following minimum standards shall apply to all residential construction projects, including 
manufactured housing. Additional or alternative requirements may apply to substandard lots, as provided 
for in Section 16.10.100. 
A. ?All dwelling units shall have a minimum gross floor area of seven hundred fifty (750) square 
feet. The minimum dwelling unit width and depth shall be twenty (20) feet, measured from the 
exterior of the structure and excluding garages, porches, patios, eaves, cabanas, and bay 
windows. 
B. ?Siding material shall consist of stucco, wood, brick, stone, or decorative concrete block. 
Synthetic materials of a similar appearance and equivalent durability shall be permitted. Exterior 
siding shall extend to a point at or near grade. However, if an approved solid wood, metal, 
concrete, or masonry perimeter foundation is used, the siding need not extend below the top of 
the foundation. 
C. ?Roofing materials shall be Class "A" as defined by the California Building Code. 
D. ?Utility hookups and an area shall be provided to accommodate installation of a clothes washer 
and dryer. The hookups and area shall be provided within the primary structure or within an 
enclosed accessory structure. 
E. ?For dwelling units located within a fire safety overlay district, additional standards apply. See 
Chapter 16.22 of this Development Code. 
F. ?Areas for trash receptacles and recycling containers shall be provided as required by the City. 
G. ?Mobilehomes or manufactured homes placed in residential districts, and not within a mobile 
home park, shall be designed and built to have an appearance similar to or in conformance with 
the predominant architectural style of homes on the street and consistent with the provisions of 
this Chapter applicable to single-family residences. This shall include, but not be limited to: 
1. ?Massing; 
2. ?Foundations; 
3. ?Roofing materials; 
4. ?Compliance with fire overlay standards; 
5. ?Building materials; and 
6. ?Window and architectural treatments. 
H. ?Every single-family detached residential development shall have a perimeter landscape buffer 
area between the development perimeter wall or fence and any and all arterial/collector streets 
where the houses do not front on the street. This buffer area shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) 
feet in width and shall be permanently landscaped. The landscape buffer area shall be a 
separate lot; it shall not be included as part of any adjacent lot containing a residential unit. This 
area is to be provided between the perimeter wall of the development and the sidewalk. 
1. ?The minimum size of the shrubs to be planted within the landscape buffer area shall be five 
gallons. At maturity, the shrubs shall cover sixty (60) percent of the landscape buffer area. 
2. ?The trees to be planted within the landscape buffer area shall be a fifty (50) percent ratio of 
fifteen (15) gallon and twenty-four (24) inch box specimens. 
3. ?Ground cover shall be planted underneath all of the shrubs. 
4. ?Automatic irrigation shall be installed within the landscape buffer area, with separate valves 
provided to water the turf areas and shrub beds. 
5. ?If turf is installed within the landscape buffer area, such turf shall be drought tolerant and 
shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the total planting area of the landscape buffer. 
6. ?Herbaceous perennials shall be planted as accent color and shall cover at least three 
percent of the total planting area of the landscape buffer. All perennials shall be a minimum 
of one gallon in size. 
7. ?The landscape buffer area shall include such other improvements as deemed necessary by 
the City in order to achieve a fully landscaped appearance. 
I. ?A minimum of ten (10) percent of all single-family detached residential units in a single-family 
detached residential development shall be single-story structures, including corner lots, unless 
the Planning Commission determines, pursuant to the process described in Section 
16.10.050(A) below, that there are counterbalancing factors associated with the development 
such that the intent of the residential design guidelines will be met notwithstanding any 
modification or waiver. This single-story requirement may be satisfied if the City finds, that the 
design of ten (10) percent of the residential units to be built as part of the development, 
including those to be located on corner lots, is such that the units have a strong single-story 
element at the front of the structure so as to minimize the appearance of bulk and overcrowding 
when viewed from the street. A single-story element is defined as the first or lowest story in a 
building which qualifies as a story as set forth in the California Building Code and which does 
not exceed fourteen (14) feet in height for the first twenty-five (25) feet from the front setback. 
Further, this single-story requirement may be modified or waived by the Planning Commission 
pursuant to the process described in Section 16.10.050(A) below. 
(Ord. 112 § 8, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.20.040, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 225, § 3A, 6-9-2009; Ord. No. 261, § 3(b), 1-8-2013) 


16.10.050 - Residential design guidelines. 
A. ?Administration. 
1. ?Intent and Purpose. 
a. ?These residential design guidelines are intended as objectives for building a diverse and 
lasting community with a strong identity and high quality residential development. It is 
envisioned that single-family detached residential development will be designed in such a 
manner as to create an attractive streetscape through implementation of Site Planning, 
architectural, and community design elements that result in variety and create visual 
interest. Single-family detached residential development projects which are characterized 
by repetitious street scenes of nearly identical two-story houses built at the minimum 
setback lines are discouraged. Rather, high quality single-family detached residential 
development is to be achieved through the use of a combination of design concepts as 
enumerated in this section to create varied, interesting, and attractive streetscapes. 
b. ?These guidelines are intended to complement the residential development standards, Site 
Planning, and design regulations contained elsewhere in this Development Code. They 
provide design solutions and design interpretations of the City's various regulations in 
effect for residential development in the City of Chino Hills. 
c. ?The guidelines are to be used by the Planning Commission during the City's design review 
process to ensure that the highest level of design quality is achieved while at the same 
time providing the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity and innovation. The 
Planning Commission shall be responsible for the design review of single-family detached 
residential development projects. 
d. ?While the overall intent of the guidelines shall be followed and every attempt shall be made 
to comply with the guidelines, compliance with any one specific guideline, or every single 
guideline, is not mandated for each project, unless the term "shall" is used specifically in 
such guideline. Compliance with any one specific guideline may be modified or waived by 
the Planning Commission if the Commission determines that there are counterbalancing 
factors associated with the development which ensure that it will be consistent with the 
overall intent of these guidelines. Any time a specific guideline is modified or waived by the 
Planning Commission, the following must be identified: (1) the specified guideline modified 
or waived, (2) the rationale for such modification, (3) the counterbalancing factor, and (4) 
how the intent of the guidelines will continue to be achieved notwithstanding such 
modification or waiver. 
2. ?Applicability. 
a. ?The provisions of this section shall apply to all single-family detached residential 
development within the City, unless a model home for the same single-family detached 
residential product type in the same recorded parent tract has been previously approved by 
the Planning Commission. Any residential construction on vacant property, any structural 
additions which are equal to fifty (50) percent or more of the floor area of the existing on-
site buildings, and any reconstruction projects which are equal to fifty (50) percent or more 
of the floor area of the existing on-site buildings shall adhere to these residential design 
guidelines and parking requirements per Chapter 16.34 of this Code, where applicable. 
Structural addition or reconstruction projects that are less than the fifty (50) percent 
threshold do not need to meet the parking requirement as indicated in Table 65-1 provided 
that the existing single-family home already provides two covered parking spaces. 
b. ?For those applicants seeking building permits for units within a single-family detached 
residential development for which a Tentative Tract Map was approved prior to the 
effective date of this chapter: (a) the seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square foot 
minimum lot size, the sixty (60) foot average minimum lot width, and the aggregate twenty 
(20) foot minimum sideyard setback do not apply as required by Section 16.10.030 of this 
chapter and (b) all of the Site Planning and architectural guidelines of this Section 
16.10.050 (Residential Design Guidelines) of this Development Code apply, except for 
subsections (B)(2)(a)(i), (B)(2)(a)(ii), (B)(2)(a) (iv), (B)(2)(a)(v), (B)(2)(b)(ii), (B)(2)(b)(iii). 
c. ?For those applicants seeking building permits for units within single-family detached 
residential developments for which a Final Map has been recorded prior to the effective 
date of this chapter: (a) the seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square foot minimum lot 
size, the sixty (60) foot average minimum lot width, and the aggregate twenty (20) foot 
minimum sideyard setback do not apply as required by Section 16.10.030 of this chapter 
and (b) all of the Site Planning and architectural guidelines of this Section 16.10.050 
(Residential Design Guidelines) apply, except for subsections (B)(2)(a)(i), (B)(2)(a)(ii), 
(B)(2)(a)(iv), (B)(2)(a)(v), (B)(2)(b)(ii), (B)(2)(b)(iii). 
3. ?Interpretation. Whenever any provision contained elsewhere in this Development Code differs 
from those in this section, the more restrictive provisions shall apply, subject to the reasonable 
interpretation of the City. 
4. ?Appeals. All actions and decisions of the Planning Commission or the Community Development 
Director as authorized by this section are subject to appeal as set forth in Section 16.58.060 
(Appeals) of the Development Code. 
5. ?Application Required. 
a. ?An application is required to initiate the City's design review process for single-family 
detached residential development, per the provisions of Section 16.58.020 (Application 
Procedures) of the Development Code. A design review application shall be deemed 
complete when it contains all of the information requested by the design review application 
form on file in the Community Development Department. 
b. ?Such an application shall be submitted concurrently with any application seeking approval 
of: (a) a tentative tract or parcel map for a single-family detached residential development 
pursuant to the Division of Land Procedures in Appendix D of this Code, (b) a preliminary 
development plan (PDP) or a PDP amendment pursuant to Chapter 16.74 of this Code, (c) 
a final development plan (FDP) or an amended FDP pursuant to Chapter 16.74 of this 
Code, or (d) building permits (with the exception of grading permits, which may be issued 
prior to the completion of the design review process), at the landowner's option. 
6. ?Proceedings. 
a. ?An application shall be filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.10.050(A)(5) and 
Section 16.58.020 (Application Procedures) of the Development Code. The Community 
Development Director or his or her designee shall review the residential design review 
application for completeness and conformance with the provisions of this Development 
Code. Upon the determination that the application is complete and the completion of the 
environmental review, the Director shall prepare a recommendation and forward the 
recommendation, the application, and any other relevant materials to the Planning 
Commission Secretary within the timeframe specified in Government Code Section 65950. 
The Secretary shall schedule the matter for consideration concurrently with the approval of 
the tentative tract or parcel map, preliminary development plan, final development plan, or 
if none of the above are applicable at the next regularly scheduled Planning Commission 
meeting for which it is practical to provide the required notice. The Community 
Development Director or designee shall provide notice to all contiguous property owners of 
the design review and the scheduled Planning Commission meeting ten (10) days prior to 
the meeting. At the Planning Commission meeting, the applicant and all other persons 
shall have the right to present testimony and evidence on any relevant aspect of the 
application under consideration. 
b. ?The Planning Commission shall hear and take action on the residential design review 
application. The Planning Commission shall act to approve, conditionally approve, or deny 
the application. When taking its action, the Commission shall adopt a resolution containing 
its findings and decisions. The resolution shall recite the facts and reasons which make the 
granting or the denial of the application necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of 
Section 16.10.050 (Residential Design Guidelines). If the application is approved, the 
resolution shall include the conditions and limitations imposed, if any. 
7. ?Required Findings. 
a. ?The Planning Commission, and the City Council on appeal, in acting to approve a 
residential design review application, may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary 
to ensure that the single-family detached residential development is consistent with the 
General Plan, is compatible with the surrounding land uses, and is in conformance with the 
provisions and intent of this Development Code. 
b. ?In making such a determination, the hearing body shall find: 
i. ?That the proposed single-family detached residential development is consistent with 
the General Plan; 
ii. ?That the proposed design and layout of the single-family detached residential 
development: 
(A) ?Is sufficiently varied to avoid monotony in the external appearance; and 
(B) ?Is in harmony with the appearance of other existing residences in the 
neighborhood, as well as those found throughout the community. 
iii. ?That the plans for the single-family detached residential development have properly 
implemented the residential design guidelines set forth in this section of the 
Development Code. 
8. ?Time Limits. 
a. ?Applicability. The time limit provisions of this section shall apply to Design Reviews for all 
single-family detached residential development within the City, unless the development is 
part of a tract home Design Review, in which case the tract home Design Review will not 
expire unless otherwise tied to the expiration of the tentative map in which the property is 
located. 
b. ?Use of Approved Design Review Plan. Any approved Design Review plan which is not 
used within the time specified in the grant of approval or, if no time is specified, within four 
years of the effective date of such approval, expires at the end of that period. For the 
purposes of this section, "used" means the commencement of construction activity 
authorized by the approval. 
c. ?[Expiration; Appeal.] Any applicant disputing the expiration of any design review plan under 
this section must appeal within ten (10) working days of the expiration date. The appeal 
must follow the process set forth in Section 16.58.060 of this Code. The appeal must be 
made to the Planning Commission for permits approved by the Planning Commission, and 
to the City Council for permits approved by the City Council. 
B. ?Site Planning Guidelines. 
1. ?An important goal of the single-family Site Planning guidelines is to create a functional and 
varied streetscape. It is the intent of these Site Planning guidelines to discourage single-family 
detached residential developments where identical homes march down long, uninterrupted 
straight streets with no variation in building placement or the street scene. 
2. ?All single-family detached residential developments will be evaluated by the Planning 
Commission for their conformity with the design guidelines contained in this section, with 
particular emphasis placed on meeting the following general and specific Site Planning criteria: 
a. ?General Site Planning Criteria. 
i. ?Variation of Size, Dimensions, and Placement of Lots within a Single-Family Detached 
Residential Development. The design of single-family detached residential 
developments shall be such that there is variation in the size, dimensions, and 
placement of the lots to avoid a repetitious street scene of nearly identical two-story 
houses built at the minimum setback lines. The size and width of the individual lots 
within a development shall differ from one another. This requirement is intended to 
create variety and avoid monotony within a development. 
ii. ?Preservation of protected trees as defined in Section 16.90.020(G) and as regulated 
by Chapter 16.90, and other significant site features. The significant existing natural 
features of the project site shall be retained. These features shall be an integral part of 
the overall design and layout of the single-family detached residential development. 
iii. ?Variation of Placement of Dwelling Units on the Individual Lots. The placement of the 
houses on individual lots within a single-family detached residential development shall 
be varied to create visual character and avoid repetition. The variation in the 
placement of each house on the individual lot shall be such that no dwelling unit on 
two or more adjacent lots are the same. 
iv. ?Provision of Neighborhood Amenities (entrance treatment for the single-family 
detached residential development, enhanced landscaping to create a mature 
appearance, decorative/accent paving, passive and active open space, et cetera). 
The design of single-family detached residential developments shall include 
neighborhood amenities which orient and give focus to the neighborhood, thereby 
creating a sense of community and providing the residents with opportunities to walk, 
jog, and bike. There is a need to create strong pedestrian and open space 
connections within and between neighborhoods. Usable outdoor areas such as 
playgrounds, tot lots, small parks, footpaths, et cetera shall be included as part of the 
overall design and layout of a new single-family detached residential development so 
as to provide areas for the residents to meet one another and to recreate. 
v. ?Enhanced Treatment of Drainage Courses and Drainage Structures. The color 
treatment of down drains and other drainage structures is encouraged. Natural 
drainage courses shall be preserved and integrated into the overall layout and design 
of a single-family detached residential development. 
vi. ?Enhanced Treatment of Walls. The walls constructed within a single-family detached 
residential development shall reflect quality and shall complement the architectural 
style of the development within which they are located. The materials of the walls shall 
be such that they are permanent. Decorative walls (i.e., masonry) shall be provided at 
the edges of the single-family detached residential development and along the streets. 
Such walls are to include architectural embellishments, whenever the walls are visible 
from any street and/or common areas within a development. All walls and fences shall 
be constructed of durable materials such as masonry, masonry combination, stone, 
brick, concrete, wrought iron (tubular steel), or other type of material as may be 
approved by the Planning Commission or the Community Development Director for 
durability, aesthetics, and sound attenuation purposes. No wood fencing shall be 
permitted; this prohibition against wood fencing is not applicable to fencing used as 
part of multi-purpose trails. No chain-link fencing is permitted in front or street facing 
side or rear yards, except that chain-link fencing that was installed prior to November 
24, 2015, shall be considered legal non-conforming structures. No barbed wire, razor 
ribbon, or other similar temporary material shall be permitted as a wall and/or fencing 
material, except in undeveloped Agriculture Ranch or Open Space areas as required 
to restrict cattle movement, or on utilities or other public facilities required to provide 
security. The setbacks of the walls in a single-family detached residential 
development shall be varied, especially when they are located adjacent to major 
streets (arterials/collector streets), in order to increase visual interest. 
vii. ?Other Amenities Unique to the Project. In addition to entrance treatments, enhanced 
landscaping, and passive and active open space, other amenities shall be included as 
part of the design of a new single-family detached residential development in order to 
provide opportunities for the residents to enjoy, meet, and recreate within their 
community. The provision of street furniture, such as benches, trash containers, 
fountains, planting pots, ornamental streetlights, and other appropriate amenities, is 
encouraged. Such amenities shall be provided in all single-family detached residential 
development within parkways and common areas, in order to create visual interest 
and address pedestrian needs. 
b. ?Specific Site Planning Criteria. 
i. ?Variable Front Yard Setbacks. Varied and staggered setbacks of the houses on the 
individual lots are encouraged in order to avoid the monotony of repetitive setbacks. 
The variation in the placement of each house on the individual lot shall be such that 
the front yard setback on two adjacent lots are not the same. Front yard setbacks 
must vary by at least two feet to satisfy these criteria. 
 
ii. ?Curvilinear Streets. Curvilinear streets are encouraged. On straight roads, knuckles or 
culs-de-sac are to be used in order to limit the length of straight stretches. Occasional 
curves change the street scene. Curves that seem very slight are readily perceived by 
the driver and interrupt the line of sight, thus creating a variable street scene. 
 
iii. ?Variable Lot Widths. Single-family detached residential developments shall include 
lots of variable widths with some of the lots being wider than the others. The use of 
different lot widths throughout a development will assist in creating a varying 
streetscape, making it more interesting by breaking up the monotony that occurs with 
uniform lot widths. In no case shall two adjacent lots have the same lot width; lot 
widths must vary, with a five foot minimum suggested. By using differing lot widths, 
variation in the building mass is provided because there is more diversity in the 
placement of each house on the individual lot and there is greater variation in the size 
and shape of the footprint of the house. A continuous row of the same lot width is 
discouraged because it will inevitably result in a dull and repetitive streetscape. 
 
iv. ?Variable Garage Placement and Orientation. The placement of garages on the 
individual lots shall be varied. Further, the garages shall be designed to reduce their 
visual impact on the street. The visual dominance of garages on streets shall be 
minimized by locating garages at the front, rear, or side of the house with a front or 
side entry. The garages shall be of differing sizes. Garage elements can be 
completely separate, detached or connected to the house by a breezeway. 
(A) ?Front Entry Garages. For front loaded garages where the entrance to the 
garage is parallel to the street, the distance between the garage door in the 
closed position and the street shall be a minimum of nineteen (19) feet. This 
nineteen (19) foot minimum dimension is to allow for the parking of vehicles on 
the driveway without encroaching into the street. 
(B) ?Garages located at the front of the house shall have a strong single-story 
element at the front of the structure, unless the Planning Commission 
determines, pursuant to the process described in Section 16.10.050(A) of this 
Development Code, that there are counterbalancing factors associated with the 
development which ensure that the intent of the guidelines will be met 
notwithstanding such modification or waiver. 
(C) ?The purpose of this single-story element requirement is to minimize the 
appearance of bulk and overcrowding when viewed from the street. The single-
story element of the garage is to provide relief and an architectural transition into 
the two-story massing of the remainder of the structure. The transition from the 
single-story to the second-story shall not occur any closer than fifteen (15) feet 
from the front of the garage. 
(D) ?Side Entry Garages. For side loaded garages with access provided from a 
curved driveway (where the garage entrance is perpendicular to the street), the 
front yard setback shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet. 
(E) ?Split, tandem (for three car garages), detached, and perpendicular garages are 
encouraged to break up the monotony which would otherwise occur if all of the 
garage doors of each house were to be located parallel to the street. 
(F) ?All garages shall have roll up garage doors. 
 
C. ?Architectural Guidelines. 
1. ?Building Massing/Scale and Style. 
a. ?Massing/Scale. Mass is the three dimensional bulk of a structure: its height, width, and 
depth. Scale is the size and magnitude of a structure as distinguished from its shape, 
which is the form of a building created by its outline. The mass and scale of a building 
should relate to its use as a single-family residence. Each residence should be designed at 
a human scale so as not to overwhelm or dominate its surroundings. 
b. ?Second Story Massing Guidelines: 
i. ?The second story of a house shall, wherever feasible, exhibit a lighter mass and scale 
than the base, by reducing floor area and/or building mass. 
ii. ?Second story wall planes oriented towards a street, including front, side, and rear 
elevations, shall be varied and articulated to reduce the overall massing and scale, 
and to avoid an uninterrupted flat wall from the ground floor to the second story. 
c. ?Style. There is no particular architectural "style" required for single- family residences. 
Rather, the focus is to be on developing a high quality residential environment, a 
neighborhood. The appearance of the houses, including their architectural style, should be 
compatible with the character of the neighborhood, including harmonious and unified style, 
form, size, color, material, and roofline. However, each of the individual houses should be 
distinguishable from one another. The mixing of various elements from distinctly different 
architectural styles should be avoided. The creation of houses with a classic and/or vintage 
style using scale, proportion, and materials is encouraged so as to create a strong sense of 
place. 
2. ?Enhanced Architectural Treatment. 
a. ?The ornamentation of the facades and variation in the massing of the structures give them 
richness and scale. All residential units shall include enhanced architectural treatment on 
all elevations (i.e., three hundred sixty (360) degree architecture) that are visible from any 
street and/or common area within a development, unless otherwise approved by the 
Planning Commission through the design review process. Long, flat, uninterrupted exterior 
walls or roof planes shall be avoided on all structures. All walls of the houses shall have 
"relief" to create visual interest and to cast shadows. Enhanced architectural treatment 
includes porches, tower elements, balconies, ornamented chimneys, and other highly 
articulated architectural features. 
b. ?Variation in the roof planes and use of ornamental elements on the roof is encouraged. 
Such variation may be achieved by changes in plane and/or the use of traditional roof 
forms such as gables, hips, sheds, and dormers. When appropriate to the architectural 
style, moderate roof overhangs of at least eighteen (18) inches shall be provided in order 
to create strong shadow lines. Both vertical and horizontal articulation of each individual 
roof is encouraged; long, unbroken rooflines are to be avoided. Rooflines are to be 
representative of the design and scale of the units under them. The pitch and scale of the 
roof is to be in proportion to the size of the house. The bulk of a building may be reduced 
by breaking the roof form into smaller parts. Flat roofs are generally discouraged, unless 
they are appropriate to the architectural style. Roof mounted equipment is prohibited. 
3. ?Varied Structure Design. The design of the houses within each single-family detached 
residential development shall be varied to create visual interest and diversity in the street scene. 
Excessive repetition of single-family houses with near identical elevations shall be avoided. A 
significant difference in the massing and composition (not just the finish materials) of each 
adjacent house is to be accomplished. One exterior design shall not be repeated more 
frequently than each fourth house. The elevations of the houses within a single-family detached 
residential development are to be varied as follows:

*?Reverse footprints, alternate orientation of 90 degrees or greater, or alternate garage orientation (i.e., 
side entry or detached) may be counted as additional elevations. 
4. ?Materials. The choice and mix of materials on the facades of the houses and the garage doors 
is important in providing an attractive living environment. Any materials applied to the exterior 
elevation shall be integrated into the overall architecture of the building so that the materials do 
not appear to be artificial or otherwise tacked onto the structure. Piecemeal embellishment and 
frequent changes in the type of materials applied to the building exterior shall be avoided. 
Whenever a building can be viewed from any street and/or common areas within a 
development, the visible elevations shall be architecturally treated, unless otherwise approved 
by the Planning Commission through the design review process. 
5. ?Vents and Downspouts. Roof flashing, rain gutters, and downspouts, vents, and other roof 
protrusions shall be finished to match the adjacent materials and/or colors. The use of copper, 
bronze, verdigris, or aged finishes is encouraged. 
6. ?Equipment Screening. Roof-mounted equipment is prohibited. Any equipment placed on the 
ground shall be shielded and architecturally screened from view from on-site parking areas, on-
site common areas within the development, any street from a point immediately adjacent to the 
site, and adjacent residentially zoned properties at the same elevation. The method of 
equipment screening shall be architecturally compatible with the design of the house in terms of 
materials, color, shape, and size. Satellite dishes, air conditioners and pool equipment shall not 
be located in the front yard; rather, they shall only be located in the rear and side yards so as to 
be screened from view of the adjoining properties and the street. 
7. ?Walls. 
a. ?Walls are to be constructed of durable materials, such as masonry, masonry combination, 
stone, brick, concrete, or other approved masonry. Walls shall include a finish. Finishes 
may be plaster, stucco, molded, patterned, or any other texture that adds interest. Walls 
are to include pilasters at appropriate intervals throughout the development and at least at 
every property line. Additionally, all walls that are visible from any street and/or common 
area within a development are to include copings. The walls shall be designed to be of 
such a style and consisting of such materials and colors which complement the 
development within which they are located. 
b. ?Other wall materials to be located within a single-family detached residential development 
shall include wrought iron (tubular steel), tile insets, grillwork, plexiglass, or other materials 
as may be approved by the City for durability, aesthetic, and/or sound attenuation 
purposes. No wood fencing shall be permitted; this prohibition against wood fencing is not 
applicable to fencing used as part of multi-purpose trails. No barbed wire, razor ribbon, or 
other similar temporary materials shall be permitted as a wall material. 
c. ?Both sides of all walls should be architecturally treated, whenever visible from any street 
and/or common area within the development. All walls and fences shall complement the 
architectural style of the development within which they are located. They shall be 
designed to be decorative, including architectural embellishments, whenever the walls are 
visible from any street and/or common area within a development. All walls and fences 
shall be constructed of durable materials such as masonry, masonry combination, stone, 
brick, concrete, wrought iron (tubular steel), or other type of material as may be approved 
by the Planning Commission or Community Development Director for durability, aesthetic, 
and/or sound attenuation purposes. 
8. ?Garage Doors. Garage doors shall appear to be set into the walls of the garage or the house 
rather than being flushed with the exterior wall of the garage or the house. A variety of 
compatible designs are to be used throughout a single-family detached residential development 
so as to insure visual interest and avoid monotony. The design of the garage door is to relate to 
the particular architectural style of the house.

Development Code. 
D. ?Required Building Separation. The building separation requirements outlined in Table 20-3 shall 
apply to any lot containing two or more dwelling units located in separate, detached structures, 
except that the minimum building separation requirement shall be six (6) feet for developments 
consisting solely of duplex dwelling units. The required separations shall be between opposite 
exterior walls of any buildings containing dwelling units. In the event that more stringent 
requirements are imposed by the California Building Code or City Fire Hazard Overlay Zone, the 
more stringent regulations shall apply.

(Ord. No. 225, § 3A, 6-9-2009) 


16.10.130 - Density bonuses and other incentives for affordable housing projects. 
A. ?Incentives for Development of Affordable Housing. 
1. ?Intent and Purpose. These density bonuses and other provisions are intended to encourage the 
development of affordable housing projects in compliance with the mandates of state law 
(Government Code Section 65916). State law requires that local governments shall grant 
density bonuses of at least twenty-five (25) percent plus additional incentives in order to 
facilitate the economic feasibility of affordable housing projects. 
    The minimum twenty-five (25) percent density bonus and additional incentives, as mandated by 
state law, are to be provided to those developers who agree to construct at least: 
a. ?Twenty (20) percent of the units affordable to lower-income households; 
b. ?Ten (10) percent of the units affordable to very low-income households; or 
c. ?Fifty (50) percent of the units for senior citizen housing. 
    Government Code Section 65915(f), in part, states that: 
The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan 
amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
    The provisions of state law preempt the land use authority of the City of Chino Hills with respect 
to the density of affordable housing projects. 
    The preemption of local authority by state law is so identified in Ordinance No. 123, an 
ordinance of the people of the City of Chino Hills, California, amending the land use element of the 
general plan of the City of Chino Hills. 
    The provisions of this section are intended to complement the residential development 
standards, Site Planning, and design guidelines contained elsewhere in this Development Code. 
They are by no means intended to replace the established standards and guidelines of the City of 
Chino Hills. 
    This section has been enacted in part to satisfy the requirements of state law. It has been put in 
place in order to assist in facilitating the construction of affordable housing projects within the City of 
Chino Hills. These projects are envisioned to be ones that will be long-lasting, quality places to live, 
and compatible with surrounding land uses and residential neighborhoods. 
    This section establishes the incentives that may be granted by the City Council, as set forth in 
state law, for the production of housing for low, very low, and senior households in accordance with 
Sections 65915, 65916, and 65917 of the Government Code. 
2. ?Definitions. Whenever the following terms are used in this section, they shall have the meanings 
as are set forth below. 
    "Additional incentives" mean the regulatory concessions that are specified in Government Code 
subsections 65915(d) and (h). 
    The "additional incentives" are to include, but not be limited to: 
i. ?A reduction in the site development standards, or a modification of the zoning code 
requirements or architectural design requirements. These standards and requirements may 
be modified, if they exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California 
Building Standards Commission (as provided in Part 2.5 commencing with Section 18901 
of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code). The incentives may include, but not limited 
to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular 
parking spaces that would otherwise be required; 
ii. ?Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the affordable housing development 
project; 
iii. ?Any other regulatory incentive or concession which would result in identifiable cost 
reductions. 
    "Affordable" means housing units offered at an affordable rent or affordable sales price. 
    "Affordable rent" means monthly housing expenses, including a reasonable allowance for 
utilities, for rental target units reserved for very low or low income households, not exceeding the

adjusted for household size, multiplied by thirty (30) percent and divided by twelve (12); 
ii. ?Low income: sixty (60) percent of the area median income for San Bernardino County, 
adjusted for household size, multiplied by thirty (30) percent and divided by twelve (12). 
    "Affordable sales price" means a sales price for which the income of very low or low income 
households, adjusted for household size, is sufficient to qualify for the purchase of target units, 
calculated on the basis of underwriting standards of mortgage financing available for the 
development. 
    "Density bonus" means a minimum density increase of at least twenty-five (25) percent over the 
maximum allowable residential density of the zoning district in which the site is located. 
    "Density bonus and operating agreement" means a legally binding agreement between a 
developer and the City of Chino Hills that is recorded against the property. The purpose of the 
agreement is to ensure that the requirements of this section of the Development Code are satisfied. 
Among other items, the agreement shall establish: 
i. ?The number of target units; 
ii. ?The size of the target units; 
iii. ?The location of the target units; 
iv. ?The terms and conditions of affordability; and 
v. ?The production schedule. 
    "Density bonus units" mean those residential units allowed pursuant to the provisions of this 
section which exceed the maximum residential density for the development site. 
    "Household size" means the number of persons assumed, as detailed in the table below, in 
determining the affordable rent or affordable sales price of target units.

affordable to very low income households; 
iii. ?A senior citizen housing development. 
    "Qualifying resident" means senior citizens or other persons eligible to reside in a senior citizen 
housing development. 
    "Senior citizen housing development" means a housing development which has been "designed 
to meet the physical and social needs of senior citizens" as that phrase is used in California Civil 
Code Section 51.2 and which qualifies as "housing for older persons" as that phrase is used in the 
federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (PL 100-430) and implementing regulations. 
    "Target unit" means a dwelling unit in a housing development that is reserved as affordable or is 
reserved for qualifying residents, so as to qualify for development incentives pursuant to this section. 
    "Very low income household" means a household with an income which does not exceed fifty 
(50) percent of the median income of San Bernardino County, as published and periodically updated 
by the State Department of Housing and Community Development pursuant to Section 50105 of the

3. ?Density Bonuses and Other Incentives. As mandated by Government Code Section 65915, the 
density bonuses and other incentives listed below are to be made available to all 
applicants/developers throughout the state, including the City of Chino Hills. In enacting this 
section, the City is fulfilling its obligations under the law. 
a. ?An applicant/developer of a qualified housing development project with target units that are 
reserved as affordable or for qualifying residents (senior citizens) for a period of no less 
than thirty (30) years is entitled to a density bonus of at least twenty-five (25) percent and 
at least one additional incentive. 
    Additional incentives may only be granted to the extent determined necessary by the City 
Council in order to render a housing development project economically feasible. 
    Incentives that involve modification to otherwise established architectural, building, or 
engineering standards may only be granted by the City Council when the Council has been 
determined that such modifications: 
i. ?Will not substantially compromise the proper utilization and functioning of the site for 
residential purposes; and 
ii. ?Will not have an adverse effect on surrounding properties. 
    The additional incentives may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

additional incentive. 
4. ?Application Required. Concurrent with the submittal of an application for approval of a Site Plan 
or final development plan for an affordable housing project, the City Council may grant: 
a. ?A twenty-five (25) percent density bonus; and/or 
b. ?Other incentives. 
    An affordable housing project shall only be approved by the City Council if a density bonus and 
operating agreement has been executed between the City and the applicant. 
    An application is required to initiate the City's review process for affordable housing projects, 
per the provisions of Section 16.58.020 (Application procedures) of the Development Code. 
    An application for an affordable housing project shall be deemed complete when it contains all 
of the information requested by the affordable housing project application form on file in the 
Community Development Department. 
5. ?Proceedings. 
a. ?An application for an affordable housing project shall be filed pursuant to the provisions of 
subsection (5)(b) of this section and Section 16.58.020 (Application procedures) of the

    The Director shall prepare a recommendation and then forward the recommendation, the 
application, and any other relevant materials to the Planning Commission Secretary. 
    The Secretary shall schedule the matter for consideration concurrently with the approval of 
the tentative tract or parcel map, preliminary development plan, final development plan, Site 
Plan, or if none of the above are applicable at the next regularly scheduled Planning 
Commission meeting for which it is practical to provide the required notice. 
b. ?The Planning Commission shall hear and take action on the affordable housing project 
application. The Planning Commission shall act to recommend to the City Council 
approval, conditional approval, or denial of the application. 
    When taking its action, the Commission shall adopt a resolution containing its findings and

6. ?Density Bonus and Target Unit Calculations. The following criteria shall be used to determine 
the minimum number of density bonus units to be granted and the minimum number of target 
units to be provided for affordable housing projects pursuant to this section. 
a. ?The minimum number of density bonus units to be granted pursuant to this section shall 
equal the maximum residential density for the site multiplied by 0.25. Any fractions of units 
shall be rounded to the next larger integer. 
b. ?The minimum number of target units to be provided pursuant to this section shall equal the 
maximum residential density multiplied by the following: 
i. ?0.10, if target units are restricted and affordable to very low income households; or

built at the proposed density or it is not financially feasible to be built by complying with the 
City's development standards of this section. In order to achieve the best possible design for 
affordable housing projects, the applicant/developer shall work with City staff to determine the 
most appropriate modifications to be made to the City's development standards and the 
appropriate degree of these modifications. The City Council shall be required to approve all 
such modifications as part of the density bonus and operating agreement prepared pursuant to 
this section. 
B. ?Density Bonus and Operating Agreements for Affordable Housing Projects. Applicants/developers 
requesting a density bonus and/or other incentives shall agree to enter into a density bonus and 
operating agreement with the City of Chino Hills.

units will be constructed and shall be binding to all future owners and successors in interest. 
4. ?All density bonus and operating agreements prepared and executed pursuant to this section 
shall include at least the following: 
a. ?The total number of units approved for the affordable housing development, including the 
number of target units;

development) as defined by this section. 
b. ?Target units shall be owner-occupied by eligible very low or lower income households 
during the use restriction period or by qualified residents in the case of a senior citizen 
housing development. 
c. ?The initial owner/purchaser of each target unit shall execute an instrument or agreement 
approved by the City restricting the sale of the target unit in accordance with the ordinance 
codified in this section during the applicable use restriction period. Such instrument or 
agreement shall be recorded against the parcel containing the target unit and shall contain 
such provisions as the City may require in order to ensure continued compliance with this 
ordinance and the state's density bonus law. 
6. ?In the case of rental housing developments, the density bonus and operating agreement shall 
provide for the following conditions governing the use of target units during the use restriction 
period: 
a. ?The rules and procedures for qualifying tenants, establishing affordable rent, filling 
vacancies, and maintaining target units for qualified tenants; 
b. ?Provisions requiring owners to verify tenant incomes, when applicable, and maintain books

application, the City Council must make one of the denial findings contained in subsection (C)(1)(b) 
of this section. 
a. ?Basis for Approval. The City Council in approving a density bonus and operating 
agreement shall find as follows:

adverse impact upon the public health or safety. There is no feasible method to 
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the 
development unaffordable to very low and low income households; 
iii. ?The denial of the affordable housing development project, or imposition of conditions, 
is required in order to comply with specific state or federal law, and there is no 
feasible method to comply without rendering the development unaffordable to very low 
and low income households; 
iv. ?Approval of the affordable housing development project would increase the 
concentration of very low and low income households in a neighborhood that already 
has a disproportionately high number of very low and low income households.

on at least two sides by land being used for resource preservation purposes, or which 
does not have adequate water or wastewater facilities to serve the project; 
vi. ?The project is not consistent with the land use designation for the subject site as set 
forth in the general plan and the City has adopted a housing element. 
c. ?Conditions of Approval.

Commission shall recommend, and the City Council shall impose, such conditions 
deemed necessary to ensure that the requested use will be in accordance with the 
findings required by this section. 
ii. ?The conditions imposed on the affordable housing development project may involve 
any pertinent factors affecting the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the

Chapter 16.12 - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 
Sections: 


16.12.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The commercial districts are established to permit a range of retail and service commercial uses to 
meet the commerce needs of City residents, visitors, and the workforce. Toward this end, the following 
districts are established: 
A. ?Neighborhood Commercial (C-N). The neighborhood commercial (C-N) district provides for a 
limited range of smaller-scale business activities which serve the needs of residents who live 
nearby. Typical businesses include, but are not limited to, food and drug stores, child care, 
clothing stores, neighborhood-serving convenience stores, and professional and business 
offices. The regulations in this chapter are aimed toward ensuring that development within the 
neighborhood commercial zone is compatible with the surrounding area with respect to the type 
of use, scale, intensity of development, architectural character, and other impacts upon the 
community, and that the activities serve the needs of the adjoining residential neighborhoods. 
B. ?Commercial Office (C-O). The commercial office (C-O) district provides locations where 
daytime, service-oriented businesses may locate to allow for the efficient interaction of 
complementary service industries. Professional offices, including medical offices and clinics, 
represent the primary permitted uses. Minor support uses may include small restaurants, cafes, 
retail shops, and child day-care centers. 
C. ?The general commercial (C-G) district provides for retail centers that serve community-wide 
needs. The general commercial district provides for commercial areas that include, but are not 
limited to, large retail uses such as "big box" stores, furniture stores, appliance and home 
electronics retailers; movie theaters; service commercial businesses; professional business 
offices; and restaurants. 
D. ?Commercial Recreation (C-R). The commercial recreation (C-R) district is intended to provide 
locations for commercial recreation-oriented uses which require, or benefit from proximity to, 
large areas of open space or open space uses. Typical uses include golf courses, equestrian 
centers, and resort hotels (which may include accessory uses typically associated with a 
destination resort: restaurants, lounges, gift shops, etc.). 
E. ?Freeway Commercial (C-F). The freeway commercial district provides for uses that are oriented 
towards serving the regional needs of the market and/or serving the needs of those who travel 
the Chino Valley Freeway (State Route 71). The proposed allowable land uses to be permitted 
in the freeway commercial district will benefit from freeway visibility, be based on tax generation 
potential, and provide a high quality commercial environment. This district allows for 
development on a minimum seven acre site with mixed commercial uses based on a 
coordinated Site Plan, regardless of ownership, which master plans all parcels and includes 
conceptual architectural design plans. Such developments are characterized by encouraging 
reciprocal circulation, access and parking based on a shared parking analysis, sufficient 
landscaping, incorporation of pedestrian and public space amenities, and should include unified 
management or restrictive covenants to realize and maintain high development standards. 
    Allowed uses in this zoning district include, but in no way are to be limited to, auto 
dealerships, entertainment centers, movie theaters, hotels, restaurants, financial institutions, 
health/fitness centers, department stores, furniture stores, home improvement centers, 
professional offices and large-scale retail commercial developments. 
(Ord. 165 § 3, 2004; Ord. 68 § 9.25.010, 1995) 


16.12.020 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
A. ?Appendix A at the end of Title 16 indicates the uses permitted in the commercial zone districts. 
Commercial uses represent the primary permitted uses, although other uses are allowed as 
accessory, conditionally permitted, and temporary uses, as indicated in Appendix A. 
B. ?Uses listed as conditionally permitted uses are subject to the review requirements and conditions 
contained in Chapter 16.68 of this Development Code. Temporary uses and conditions are subject to 
the review requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.80. Also, certain uses such as 
churches and businesses involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages may be subject to special use 
standards outlined in Chapter 16.42. 
C. ?Special Use Standards. Certain uses, such as antennas, private kennels, automobile maintenance, 
automobile service stations, and car washes, although permitted in a specific commercial zoning 
district subject to the granting of a Conditional Use Permit by the Planning Commission pursuant to 
the provisions of Chapter 16.68 (Conditional Use Permits), require the imposition of additional 
development standards beyond those set forth for the district. These additional standards are 
required to ensure that such uses are operated in a manner that does not adversely impact the 
surrounding land uses. 
D. ?A boarding house may be conditionally permitted in the C-F, C-G, and C-R zoning districts provided 
that: 
1. ?The boarding house contains no healthcare facilities similar to those found in a medical clinic. 
2. ?Not more than two persons are permitted to occupy one rental room. 
3. ?One uncovered on-site parking space must be provided for each sleeping room. 
(Ord. 106 § 2, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.25.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 13, 11-24-2015; Ord. No. 299, § 8, 6-14-2016) 


16.12.030 - Site plan approval required. 
    A Site Plan approval, as described in Chapter 16.76, is required for all commercial development 
projects involving the construction of new buildings. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.25.030, 1995) 


16.12.040 - Development standards. 
    Table 25-1 provides the development standards for all commercial zone districts. 
(Ord. 165 § 8, 2004; Ord. 68 § 9.25.040, 1995) 


16.12.050 - Accessory uses and structures. 
    Accessory buildings and structures are subject to the same height and setback requirements 
described for primary buildings and structures in Table 25-1, except as modified by Section 16.06.070, 
Maximum projections into yards. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.25.050, 1995) 


16.12.060 - Alcoholic beverage outlets. 
    The establishment, operation, and maintenance of any alcoholic beverage outlet is subject to the 
following regulations: 
A. ?It is unlawful to establish an onsite alcoholic beverage outlet for patrons of legal drinking age or 
older only if the location is: 
1. ?Within five hundred (500) feet of any area zoned or used for any church or park or any 
educational institution utilized by minors; or 
2. ?Within two hundred (200) feet of any area zoned for residential purposes, including 
residential areas within a Planned Development zoning district. 
B. ?Zoning districts in which onsite and offsite sales of alcoholic beverages is permitted are shown 
in Appendix A to this Development Code at the end of Title 16. 
C. ?The establishment of any alcoholic beverage outlet includes the opening of such a business as 
a new business, the relocation of such business, the conversion of an existing use or premises 
to any alcoholic beverage outlet use, and/or the expansion or change of the type of alcoholic 
beverages to be sold at an alcoholic beverage outlet (that is, a change in the type of retail liquor 
license within a license classification).

Chapter 16.13 - MIXED USE DISTRICT 


16.13.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A. ?The provisions of this chapter establish general regulations for the development and use of mixed 
use development containing both residential and commercial uses integrated with each other relative 
to architecture, landscape, common areas and access. 
B. ?Mixed use regulations are established to enable housing and nonresidential uses to locate within the 
same site within a short walk of each other for the benefit of the community and to support City 
objectives to encourage sustainable forms of development. 
C. ?A variety of residential products are appropriate for mixed use districts when well integrated with the 
site and commercial uses, including medium density detached and attached single family housing, 
medium and high density multifamily housing, lofts, and live/work units. 
D. ?A variety of community serving commercial uses are appropriate for mixed use districts when well 
integrated with the site and residential uses, including restaurant, retail, hotel, entertainment, 
professional office, and personal services. Distinctive commercial uses that expand the dining, 
shopping, and entertainment opportunities available to the community are strongly encouraged. 
E. ?All mixed use development shall incorporate the following elements: walkability and connectivity; 
inviting and functional public spaces; mix of housing and commercial uses; consistent high quality 
design and material; compatibility with adjacent land uses; and environmental sensitivity. 
F. ?Surface parking shall be enhanced with strong pedestrian linkages, landscape, and lighting. 
Structured parking shall be screened with landscape and/or architectural features and designed to 
be compatible with the architectural style of the mixed use buildings. 
(Ord. No. 285, § 7, 6-9-2015) 


16.13.020 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
A. ?Appendix A at the end of Title 16 indicates the uses permitted in the mixed use district. Residential 
and commercial uses represent the primary permitted uses. 
B. ?Uses listed as conditionally permitted uses are subject to the review requirements and conditions 
contained in Chapter 16.68 of this Development Code. Temporary uses and conditions are subject to 
the review requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.80. Also, certain uses such as 
businesses involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages may be subject to special use standards 
outlined in Section 16.12.060. 
C. ?Special Use Standards. Certain uses, such as wireless facilities are subject to the review 
requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.44. These additional standards are required to 
ensure that such uses are operated in a manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding land 
uses. 
(Ord. No. 285, § 7, 6-9-2015) 


16.13.030 - Site plan approval required. 
A ?Site plan approval, as described in Chapter 16.76, is required for all mixed use development projects 
involving the construction of new or substantially remodeled buildings. In addition to the basis for 
denial or approval set forth in Section 16.76.060, the hearing body shall also find that the proposed 
mixed use project: 
A. ?Incorporates the following elements: walkability and connectivity; inviting and functional public 
spaces; mix of housing and commercial uses; consistent high quality design and materials; 
compatibility with adjacent land uses, and environmental sensitivity. 
B. ?Enhances surface parking with strong pedestrian linkages, landscape, and lighting. Any parking 
structures shall be screened with landscaping and/or architectural features designed to be 
compatible with the architectural style of the buildings in the mixed use development. 
C. ?Complies with the development standards set forth in Section 16.13.040 of this chapter. 
D. ?Complies with the mixed use guidelines specified in Section 16.13.050.

16.13.050 - Mixed use guidelines. 
    While the overall intent of the guidelines shall be followed and every attempt shall be made to 
comply with the guidelines, compliance with any one specific guideline, or every single guideline, is not 
mandated for each project, unless the term "shall" is used specifically in such guideline. Compliance with 
any one specific guideline may be modified or waived by the Planning Commission if the Commission 
determines that there are counterbalancing factors associated with the development which ensure that it 
will be consistent with the overall intent of these guidelines. Any time a specific guideline is modified or 
waived by the hearing body, the following must be identified: (1) the specified guideline modified or 
waived, (2) the rationale for such modification, (3) the counterbalancing factor, and (4) how the intent of 
the guidelines will continue to be achieved notwithstanding such modification or waiver. 
A. ?Mixed use projects shall provide unique contributions to the surrounding community through 
enhanced architectural treatments and designs incorporated throughout the residential and 
commercial components, dynamic and inviting public spaces, and distinctive commercial uses 
that expand the dining, shopping, and entertainment opportunities available to the community. 
B. ?Projects shall follow the overall intent of the architectural design, site planning, and other 
guidelines and standards identified in Chapter 16.06, Chapter 16.08, Chapter 16.09, Sections 
16.10.040 and 16.10.050, and Chapter 16.34 of this Development Code. While the overall intent 
of the aforementioned guidelines and standards shall be followed, compliance with any one 
specific guideline, or every single guideline, is not mandated for mixed use projects. 
C. ?Mixed use projects shall feature three hundred sixty (360) degrees of architectural treatment 
and enhancement; the residential and commercial components shall be architecturally 
integrated, featuring the same architectural theme, key design features, colors and materials, 
and other major architectural elements. 
D. ?Projects shall incorporate common open space elements providing public gathering spaces 
featuring amenities such as shade structures, water features, seating areas, enhanced lighting 
and landscaping, wireless internet access, and other features that enhance the quality of the 
open space for public use. These gathering spaces should create dynamic and appealing 
atmospheres to attract residents from the mixed use development and the community into the 
open space areas and commercial component of the project. Open space amenities shall be 
provided throughout the residential and commercial components of the project. 
E. ?Enhanced paving, landscaping, and lighting shall be used to encourage pedestrian circulation 
throughout the development. Pedestrian pathways and linkages between the commercial and 
residential components shall be designed and located to facilitate and encourage pedestrian 
access between the communities. 
F. ?Mixed use projects shall demonstrate an increased degree of environmental sensitivity. Projects 
shall be designed to achieve energy and water efficiency above that required by the Building 
Code. Energy efficient techniques may include green building, Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) standards, solar energy, or other available energy efficient 
systems or programs. 
(Ord. No. 285, § 7, 6-9-2015) 


16.13.060 - Entertainment establishments providing dancing, music, and similar activities. 
A. ?Noise levels in the mixed use district shall not exceed the standards set forth in Chapter 16.48 of this 
Development Code, when measured at the nearest residential property line for the adjacent 
properties. Noise levels within the residential dwelling units within the mixed use development shall 
not exceed interior noise levels set forth in Chapter 16.48 
B. ?Entertainment uses in the mixed use district providing dancing, music, and similar activities may be 
required to submit a security plan for review by the Community Development Department, the Police 
Department, and the Fire Authority. This security plan, which may be approved by the Director of 
Community Development or his or her designee, may include information on the number and type of 
security personnel to be on duty during hours of operation, the type of equipment provided to the 
security personnel, and proposed methods of coordination with public safety personnel (police and 
fire). 
1. ?The Community Development Director may require a review and update to the security plan on 
a periodic basis or in response to concerns reported to and/or identified by the City, Police 
Department, and/or Fire Authority. 
C. ?The City may apply additional requirements or limitations to ensure compatibility with surrounding 
land uses where the entertainment use in question relies upon a conditional use permit, temporary 
use permit, or other discretionary permit. 
(Ord. No. 285, § 7, 6-9-2015) 


16.13.070 - Outdoor display and storage. 
    The following restrictions apply to outdoor display and storage of goods and materials in the mixed 
use district: 
A. ?Only goods and materials sold or used on-site may be stored or displayed.

Chapter 16.14 - BUSINESS PARK AND LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 
Sections: 


16.14.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The business park and light industrial districts are established to facilitate the development of larger-
scale businesses involved in light manufacturing, distribution, or services, as well as office and retail uses 
in some areas. Toward this end, the following districts are established: 
A. ?Business Park (BP). The business park (BP) district provides for a wide range of nonresidential 
uses, generally encompassing light industrial, retail, office, and other commercial uses. Retail 
uses may comprise as much as one hundred (100) percent of the site, and serve local and 
regional market areas. The business park district is intended to provide maximum flexibility to 
the City, landowners, and tenants in establishing and operating nonresidential uses. 
Development is expected to be predominated by buildings of one or two stories, but may attain 
any height, provided that requirements for parking and landscaping are met. In some cases, 
retail uses will be on the ground floor, with offices above. 
B. ?Light Industrial (LI). The light industrial (LI) district provides for a more limited range of uses, 
including only light industrial and manufacturing uses which benefit from separation from 
residential, office, and retail districts. Adult businesses, as defined in Chapter 16.46 of this 
Code, may be located only in the LI district. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.010, 1995) 


16.14.020 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
A. ?Appendix A: Regulation of Uses by Zone District of this Development Code at the end of Title 16 
indicates the uses permitted in the business park and light industrial districts. 
B. ?Uses listed as conditionally permitted uses are subject to the review requirements and conditions 
contained in Chapter 16.68 of this Development Code. Temporary uses and conditions are subject to 
the review requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.80. Also, certain uses may be 
subject to special use standards outlined in Chapter 16.42. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 14, 11-24-2015) 


16.14.030 - Site plan approval. 
    A Site Plan approval, as described in Chapter 16.76, is required for all industrial development 
projects involving the construction of new buildings. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.030, 1995) 


16.14.040 - Development standards. 
A. ?General Standards. Table 30-1 provides the development standards for the business park and light 
industrial districts. 
B. ?Building Materials. Metal buildings are prohibited in the BP and LI districts, unless specifically 
permitted by the Planning Commission. 
C. ?Single-Room Occupancy Units. Development standards for single-room occupancy unit facilities will 
be subject to the provisions presented in Table 30-2, unless otherwise permitted through the 
Conditional Use Permit process. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.040, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 262, § 3(f), 4-23-2013) 


16.14.050 - Parking standards. 
    Parking standards for uses in the BP and LI districts are shown in Chapter 16.34 of this Code. Where 
a mix of use types is proposed in the BP district (e.g., retail, office, and manufacturing), an alternative 
parking standard may be approved by the Director of Community Development. Changes in parking 
standards must be accompanied by a parking analysis, which will be reviewed by the City Traffic 
Engineer. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.050, 1995) 


16.14.060 - Accessory uses and structure. 
    Accessory buildings and structures are subject to the same height and setback requirements 
described for primary buildings and structures in Table 30-1, except as modified by Section 16.06.060, 
Maximum projections into yards. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.30.060, 1995)

Chapter 16.16 - INSTITUTIONAL/PUBLIC FACILITIES DISTRICTS 
Sections: 


16.16.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The intent of this chapter is to create zoning districts which will identify and preserve public and 
private facilities and institutions. Toward this end, two zone districts are established as follows: 
A. ?InstitutionalPrivate (I-1). The institution-alprivate (I-1) district encompasses a variety of 
private institutions, including churches and private schools. 
B. ?InstitutionalPublic (I-2). The institutionalpublic (I-2) district applies to all public facilities in 
Chino Hills, including City, county, and other government properties (such as the Civic Center), 
public schools, fire stations, flood control channels, and utilities and utility rights-of-way. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.35.010, 1995) 


16.16.020 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
A. ?Appendix A: Regulation of Uses by Zone District of this Development Code indicates the uses 
permitted in the I-1 and I-2 zone districts. Only public and private public facilities are permitted as 
primary uses, although other uses are allowed as accessory, conditionally permitted, and temporary 
uses, as indicated in Appendix A. 
B. ?Uses listed as conditionally permitted uses are subject to the review requirements and conditions 
contained in Chapter 16.68 of this Development Code. Temporary uses and conditions are subject to 
the review requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.80.. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.35.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 15, 11-24-2015) 


16.16.030 - Site plan approval required. 
    A Site Plan approval, as described in Chapter 16.76, is required for all projects in the I-1 and I-2 
districts involving the construction of new buildings. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.35.030, 1995) 


16.16.040 - Development standards. 
    Table 35-1 indicates the development standards for the institutional/public facilities zone districts.

Chapter 16.18 - RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT 
Sections: 


16.18.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The recreation and open space (OS) district is established to provide public open space areas for 
active and passive recreational use. This zone district applies to public open space lands which have 
been acquired in fee ownership by the City or other public agency, and includes public recreational 
facilities and passive parks, as well as the Chino Hills State Park. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.40.010, 1995) 


16.18.020 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
A. ?Appendix A: Regulation of Uses by Zone District of this Development Code indicates the uses 
permitted in the OS zone district. Only public parks are permitted as primary uses, although other 
uses are allowed as accessory, conditionally permitted, and temporary uses, as indicated in 
Appendix A. 
B. ?Uses listed as conditionally permitted uses are subject to the review requirements and conditions 
contained in Chapter 16.68 of this Development Code. Temporary uses and conditions are subject to 
the review requirements and conditions contained in Chapter 16.80. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.40.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 16, 11-24-2015) 


16.18.030 - Development standards. 
    No specific development standards apply to public facility buildings constructed within public parks. 
Buildings shall be designed and constructed to reflect the character of the parks in which they are located 
and to ensure compatibility with development on adjacent properties. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.40.030, 1995) 


Chapter 16.20 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
Sections: 


16.20.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A. ?The Planned Development (PD) district is established to allow flexible development plans to be 
prepared. Such plans are intended to promote integrated, cohesive, mixed-use neighborhoods and 
to incorporate urban design considerations into the planning process. 
B. ?Chapter 16.60, 16.62 and 16.74 of this Development Code outline the applicable procedures for 
establishing a PD district and for reviewing subsequent development applications for projects located 
in a PD. 
(Ord. 112 § 10, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.45.010, 1995) 


16.20.020 - PD districts established. 
A. ?Existing PD developments are indicated on the Official Zoning Map. These include the following, 
listed with the case numbers assigned by the County of San Bernardino or the City of Chino Hills and 
the name of the major project with which each PD is associated: 
1. ?PD 5-157 (Oak Tree Downs)

Community Development and are incorporated into this Development Code by reference. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.45.020, 1995) 


16.20.030 - Requirements for application of the PD district. 
    A full level of public services and facilities must either exist or be planned. In addition, all of the 
following conditions must apply in order to apply the PD district: 
A. ?The PD district could serve to preserve the value and character of an area which is: 
1. ?Varied in topographical relief, and/or 
2. ?Characterized by significant amenities and natural features. 
B. ?The site in question would benefit from design flexibility. 
C. ?The site in question is at least twenty-five (25) acres in size. 
D. ?With respect to all applications which seek to increase density for residential development 
projects, including residential developments in the Planned Development district, a fiscal impact 
analysis shall be prepared as required by the City and paid for by the applicant. Further, this 
report shall include an analysis of the project's effect on the City's revenues, expenditures, 
service levels, capital improvement needs and project's ability to general tax revenue. 
(Ord. 112 § 11, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.45.030, 1995) 


16.20.040 - Permitted uses, accessory uses, temporary uses, and conditional uses. 
    Each PD district may establish its own unique land use regulations regarding uses permitted by right, 
permitted accessory uses, and conditionally permitted uses. However, the following general guidelines 
shall apply: 
A. ?Where a PD does not establish specific permitted, conditionally permitted, accessory, or 
temporary uses, these shall be the same as those shown in Appendix A of this Development 
Code (at the end of Title 16) for the land use district which most closely corresponds to the 
proposed land use(s) in the PD. 
B. ?Permitted accessory uses shall be subject to the same conditions of use and development as 
are contained in this Development Code. 
C. ?Those uses listed in Appendix A (Regulation of Uses By Zoning District) of this Development 
Code as conditionally permitted uses shall be permitted in a Planned Development (PD) district 
only subject to the granting of a Conditional Use Permit by the Planning Commission pursuant 
to the provisions of Chapter 16.68 (Conditional Use Permits). Certain uses, such as antennas, 
private kennels, automobile maintenance, automobile service station, and car wash uses, 
although permitted in a PD district subject to the granting of a Conditional Use Permit by the 
Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 16.68 (Conditional Use Permits), 
require the imposition of additional development standards beyond those set forth for the PD 
district. These additional standards are required to ensure that such uses are operated in a 
manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding land uses. 
D. ?Uses listed in Appendix A of this Development Code as temporary uses shall be permitted in a 
PD zone only subject to the temporary use regulations contained in Chapters 16.40 and 16.80 
of this Development Code. 
E. ?All uses designated in Appendix A as prohibited shall also be prohibited in the PD zone. 
(Ord. 106 § 3, 1998; Ord. 68 § 9.45.040, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 292, § 17, 11-24-2015) 


16.20.050 - Development standards. 
    Each PD district may establish unique development standards which shall be prepared in 
conjunction with the subject PD application. The final development plans approved by the City Council 
shall serve as the applicable zoning regulations. Whenever a PD zone does not contain any standards for 
a particular aspect of development (such as setbacks, lot size, or permitted uses), then the development 
standards for the zoning district which is closest to the proposed use shall apply. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.45.050, 1995) 


16.20.060 - Minimum development standards for residential uses in a PD. 
    All single-family detached residential developments in a Planned Development district or in a PD 
shall comply with the following minimum development standards, regardless of whether such 
development product is referred to as a "condominium," an "air space lot," or any other terminology, 
unless a reduced lot size and different minimum development standards are approved by the City Council 
per Section 16.20.070 (Reduced lot sizes): 
A. ?Lot Size and Dimensions. The minimum lot size for single-family detached residential 
development in the PD district or in a PD is seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square feet 
with a minimum average lot width of sixty (60) feet to be provided in the development and in no 
case shall any seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square foot lot be less than fifty (50) feet in 
width. This minimum lot size and minimum lot width shall apply to all single-family detached 
residential lots in the PD district or in a PD. 
B. ?Setbacks. 
1. ?Front Yard. Single-family detached residential units in the PD district or in a PD shall have 
a minimum average front yard setback of twenty-two (22) feet and in no case shall any 
setback be less than twenty (20) feet, with the exception of side loaded garages with 
access provided from a curved driveway. For lots with side loaded garages (the garage 
entrance is perpendicular to the street), the front yard setback shall be a minimum of 
sixteen (16) feet. 
2. ?Side Yard. The minimum sideyard setback for residential uses in the PD district or in a PD 
shall be an aggregate of twenty (20) feet for each lot and a minimum setback of at least 
seven feet shall be provided on any given lot. Uniform sideyard setbacks are prohibited. 
Rather, the sideyard setbacks on each lot are to be different so that the same setback is 
randomly dispersed throughout the development in order to avoid the monotony which 
results from repeating the same sideyard setback on each lot. 
3. ?Rear Yard. Single-family detached residential units in a PD district or in a PD shall have a 
minimum rear yard setback of fifteen (15) feet. A flat, usable area with a minimum 
dimension of fifteen (15) feet is to be provided in the backyard and this area is not to 
include any area within the front or side yard setback. 
C. ?Driveway Length. Single-family detached residential lots in the PD district or in a PD shall have 
a minimum driveway length of nineteen (19) feet from the front of the garage door in the closed 
position to the end of the driveway for garages where the entrance is parallel to the street. 
D. ?Landscape Buffer Areas. All single-family detached residential developments in the PD district 
shall have a perimeter landscape buffer area between the development perimeter wall and any 
and all arterial/collector streets where the houses do not front onto the street. This buffer area 
shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width and shall be landscaped. The landscaped 
setback shall be part of a separate lot and shall not be included as part of any adjacent 
residential lot. This area is to be provided between the perimeter wall of the development and 
the sidewalk. 
1. ?The minimum size of shrubs to be planted within the landscape buffer area shall be five 
gallons. At maturity, the shrubs shall cover sixty (60) percent of the landscape buffer area. 
2. ?The trees to be planted within the landscape buffer area shall be a fifty (50) percent ratio of 
fifteen (15) gallon and twenty-four (24) inch box specimens. 
3. ?Ground cover shall be planted underneath all shrubs. 
4. ?Automatic irrigation shall be installed within the landscape buffer area, with separate valves 
provided to water the turf areas and shrub beds. 
5. ?If turf is installed within the landscape buffer area, such turf shall be drought tolerant and 
shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the total planting area of the landscape buffer. 
6. ?Herbaceous perennials shall be planted as accent color and shall cover at least three 
percent of the total planting area of the landscape buffer. All perennials shall be a minimum 
of one gallon in size. 
7. ?The landscape buffer area shall include such other improvements as deemed necessary by 
the City in order to achieve a fully landscaped appearance. 
E. ?Single-Story Elements. 
1. ?A minimum of ten (10) percent of all single-family detached residential units in a single-
family detached residential development shall be single-story structures, including corner 
lots, unless the Planning Commission determines, pursuant to the process described in 
Section 16.10.050(A) of this Development Code, that there are counterbalancing factors 
associated with the development which ensure that the intent of the residential design 
guidelines will be met notwithstanding such modification or waiver. 
2. ?This requirement may be satisfied if the Planning Commission finds, during the residential 
design review process undertaken pursuant to Section 16.10.050 (Residential design 
guidelines), that the design of ten (10) percent of the residential units to be built as part of 
the development, including those to be located on corner lots, is such that the units have a 
strong single-story element at the front of the structure so as to minimize the appearance 
of bulk and overcrowding when viewed from the street. A single-story element is defined as 
the first or lowest story in a building which qualifies as a story as set forth in the California 
Building Code and which does not exceed fourteen (14) feet in height for the first twenty-
five (25) feet from the front setback. Further, this single-story requirement may be modified 
or waived as set forth in subsection (a) of Section 16.10.050 (Residential design 
guidelines) if there are counterbalancing factors associated with the development which 
ensure that the intent of the guidelines will be met notwithstanding such modification or 
waiver. 
F. ?Walls. All walls within a PD development shall complement the architectural style of the 
development within which they are located. All walls shall be designed to be decorative, 
including architectural embellishments, whenever the walls are visible from any street and/or 
common area within the development. All walls shall be constructed of durable materials such 
as masonry, masonry combination, stone, brick, concrete, wrought iron (tubular steel), or other 
type of material as may be approved by the Planning Commission or the Community 
Development Director for durability, aesthetic, and/or sound attenuation purposes. No wood 
fencing shall be permitted; this prohibition against wood fencing is not applicable to fencing 
used as part of multi-purpose trails. No barbed wire, razor wire, or other similar temporary 
material shall be permitted as a wall material. 
G. ?Parking. Parking requirements for new residential construction on vacant property and any 
structural additions or reconstruction projects which are equal to fifty (50) percent or more of the 
floor area of the existing on-site buildings within the PD district shall comply with Chapter 16.34

16.20.080 - Grading standards. 
    A Planned Development may establish modified grading standards to reflect the unique 
characteristics of a particular project. Absent the approval of such modifications by the Planning 
Commission, the grading guidelines and standards contained in this Development Code shall apply. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.45.070, 1995) 


16.20.090 - Design review for residential projects. 
    Design review of the Planned Development districts is intended to promote orderly, attractive, and 
harmonious and compatible development, and the general welfare by preventing establishment of 
residences or erection of structures having qualities which are not properly related to their sites, 
surroundings, traffic circulation or their environmental setting within these districts. To achieve these 
objectives, the following requirements for design review apply within the PD district: 
A. ?Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section: 
1. ?"Custom homes" means homes which are designed by an architect in cooperation with a 
property owner or developer where the design will not be utilized on more than one parcel 
within a tract. Custom homes do not include those which are built on a "semi-custom" 
basis; that is, those which are built by the developer/builder of the residential tract to order, 
but from a limited number of styles offered by the developer/builder. 
2. ?"Production homes" means homes which are generally built by a single builder constructing 
an entire residential tract, or phase of such tract, based upon the offering of model homes 
or homes which are substantially similar to other homes within the tract, or a phase of such 
tract, and which offer the buyer only limited options in the exterior appearance of the unit 
(such as color or type of architectural detailing). 
3. ?"Model homes" means homes which are built in a tract or a phase of such tract for 
purposes of allowing the developer or owner to sell other parcels within the tract, or phase 
of such tract, by duplicating the design of such homes. 
4. ?"Residential construction" means new construction on vacant property; structural additions 
which are equal to fifty (50) percent or more of the floor area of existing onsite buildings; 
and reconstruction projects which are equal to fifty (50) percent or more of the floor area of 
existing buildings. 
B. ?Residential construction within the PD district shall be subject to design review prior to the 
issuance of any building permits (with the exception of grading permits, which may be issued 
prior to the completion of the design review process). The Building Official shall obtain written 
verification of the approval of residential design by the Planning Commission before issuing any 
building permits for residential construction within a PD district, except as follows: 
1. ?In the case of production homes, if: (a) the design of a model home or model homes in a 
tract has/have been approved by the Planning Commission; or (b) if a model home or 
model homes has/have been built or the permit(s) for a model home or model homes 
was/were issued prior to the effective date of this section; or (c) a model home or homes 
has/have already been approved through the plan check process; no further approvals are 
necessary if the proposed production home(s) are built within the same tract or in adjacent 
tracts of the PD, if the unit(s) will be located on lots which are within twenty (20) percent of 
the minimum lot size of, and duplicate, the model home(s) which previously received 
approval(s) as set forth in (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph. 
2. ?In the case of custom homes or production homes, if the Planning Commission has 
approved a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&R's) which have 
been recorded against the property for which a building permit is sought, and the CC&R's 
restrict the building of structures on the property with respect to architectural review, 
minimum square footage, materials to be used in the exterior construction of structures, 
roofing materials, setbacks and height, then no further design approval is necessary from 
the Planning Commission. 
C. ?The Planning Commission shall be responsible for design review of residential development 
within PD districts. 
D. ?1. ?The design of residential construction shall be considered by the Planning Commission 
upon application by the owner and/or developer. An application for design review shall be 
deemed complete when it contains all of the information requested by the design review 
application developed by the Community Development Director. 
2. ?An application can be filed at any time, including the filing of an application in conjunction 
with a Tentative Map application. 
a. ?If a complete application for design review for a property has been received by the 
City's Community Development Office less than sixty (60) days prior to, or after, the 
approval of the Tentative Map for the property, the Planning Commission shall have 
sixty (60) days to approve, approve with modifications or deny the application. 
b. ?If a complete application for design review for a property has been received by the 
City's Community Development Office at least sixty (60) days prior to the date a 
Tentative Map application for the property is set to be heard by the Planning 
Commission, the Planning Commission shall approve, approve with modifications, or 
deny the application at the same meeting where a decision is made by the Planning 
Commission on the Tentative Map application. 
c. ?If the Planning Commission does not take action within the time restrictions set forth 
above, the application shall be deemed approved. 
E. ?The following design elements of homes within a PD shall be considered by the Planning 
Commission: 
1. ?The compatibility of the proposed design with the character and architecture of residences 
located within the same tract, and adjacent tracts of the PD in which the property which is 
the subject of the application is located. 
2. ?The size of individual units in proportion to the lots on which they are to be placed, and 
their relationship to other existing residential dwelling units (particularly units within a tract 
and adjacent tracts of the PD in which the property which is the subject of the application is 
located). 
3. ?The number and mix of particular unit types or elevations within a residential tract of 
production homes. 
4. ?Types of materials to be used in the exterior construction of units. 
5. ?The type of roofing materials to be used. 
6. ?The placement of units on lots, including setbacks from front and side lot lines. 
F. ?If a proposed residential unit within a tract of the PD, or phase of such tract: (a) does not vary by 
more than ten (10) percent from the smallest or largest unit previously approved or constructed 
within the PD, or an adjacent tract within the PD; and (b) the unit is located within a tract which 
has minimum lot sizes within twenty (20) percent of the minimum lot size of the tract which is 
being used for the comparison stated in (a); then the size of the unit shall not be considered 
with respect to the Planning Commission's decision on a design review application. Once a 
determination has been made by the Community Development Director that a unit within a PD 
is within this ten (10) percent allowable unit size variation, the determination shall be used as 
the minimum or maximum unit size which can be built without the planning commission 
reviewing the size of the unit. 
G. ?The proposed price of homes shall not be a design review element. 
H. ?To encourage cohesive design within neighborhoods, the following design parameters shall be 
used as guidelines: 
1. ?Residential units within a tract of the PD, or phases of such tract, should generally not be 
permitted to vary from the average size of units previously approved or constructed within 
the tract, a phase of such tract, or adjacent tracts of the PD by more than twenty (20) 
percent. This percentage can be adjusted to account for the difference in lot sizes between 
the proposed unit(s) and units within the same tract of the PD, a phase of such tract, and 
adjacent tracts of the PD. 
2. ?Units within a phase of a tract of a PD should be required to maintain the same level of 
architectural detailing as units in the preceding phases of the tract. (As an example, if a 
front elevation in the first phase of a tract contained homes which were built with covering 
of enhanced materials such as brick or stone, units in all following phases should be built 
with the same type and approximate percentage of materials). 
I. ?1. ?The Community Development Director may approve the following changes to an approved 
residential design: 
a. ?Minor changes in the types and amounts of materials to be used in the exterior 
construction of the units. 
b. ?Minor changes in unit elevations. 
c. ?Minor changes in the number of particular floor plans of production homes to be built 
within a tract. 
2. ?The Community Development Director can at his or her sole discretion submit any request 
for changes with respect to the above elements to the Planning Commission. 
J. ?Time Limits. 
1. ?Applicability. The time limit provisions of this section shall apply to design reviews for all 
single-family detached residential development within the City, unless the development is 
part of a tract home design review, in which case the tract' home Design Review will not 
expire unless otherwise tied to the expiration of the tentative map in which the property is 
located. 
2. ?Use of Approved Design Review Plan. Any approved design review plan which is not used 
within the time specified in the grant of approval or, if no time is specified, within four years 
of the effective date of such approval, expires at the end of that period. For the purposes of 
this section, "used" means the commencement of construction activity authorized by the 
approval. 
3. ?[Expiration; Appeal.] Any applicant disputing the expiration of any design review plan under 
this section must appeal within ten (10) working days of the expiration date. The appeal 
must follow the process set forth in Section 16.58.060 of this Code. The appeal must be 
made to the Planning Commission for permits approved by the Planning Commission, and 
to the City Council for permits approved by the City Council.

from becoming a barrier between firefighting equipment/personnel and wildland areas. 
B. ?The Fire Hazard Overlay District shall be designated in the City's General Plan and updated as 
required based on information provided by California Department of Forestry and Fire (Cal Fire) or 
Chino Valley Fire District (CVFD). 
C. ?Project design and structures located within the "Fire Hazard Overlay District" shall also meet the 
requirements of Chapter 16.06.160, Fire Resistive Design Requirements, unless the requirements of 
the Fire Hazard Overlay District are more restrictive, in which case the more restrictive requirements 
shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 329, § 5, 6-12-2018) 


16.22.020 - General provisions. 
A. ?The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new construction, and to existing structures where 
construction to an existing structure results in an increase in size of fifty (50) percent or more, within 
the Fire Hazard Overlay District. 
B. ?All proposed development must meet all other applicable standards properly adopted by the Chino 
Valley Fire District. 
C. ?The area of the City regulated by the Fire Hazard Overlay District has been adopted as Figure 5-10,

1. ?Land development proposals shall be designed to blend into the natural landscape and to 
minimize scarring of vegetation and terrain. The ridgeline development standards 
contained in Chapter 16.08 of this Development Code shall be applied as appropriate. 
2. ?A one hundred fifty (150) foot building setback shall be maintained from the centerline of 
each scenic highway. The setback area shall be maintained in a natural condition to the 
greatest extent possible. Where improvements or plantings are required, they shall 
conform to the standards contained in this Development Code or the Chino Hills 
Landscape Manual. Variance from established setbacks shall only be approved if one or 
more of the following findings are made: 
a. ?Topographic characteristics preclude such a setback; 
b. ?Topographic or vegetative characteristics provide adequate screening of buildings and 
parking areas from the right-of-way; 
c. ?Property dimensions preclude such a setback; 
d. ?Placing the proposed structures beyond the required setback would destroy as scenic 
resource which would not be affected by placing the structures closer to the roadway. 
B. ?Access Drives. The number and size of right-of-way access drives should be minimized. 
Developments involving concentrations of commercial activities should be designed to function 
as an integral unit, with common parking and access drives provided. 
C. ?Landscaping. The removal of native vegetation, especially trees, shall be minimized. 
Replacement vegetation and landscaping shall be compatible with the local environment and, 
where practicable, capable of surviving with a minimum of maintenance and supplemental 
water. Landscaping and plantings should not obstruct significant views, either when installed or 
when mature growth is achieved. 
D. ?Parking and Storage Areas. Parking and permitted outside storage areas shall be screened 
from view to the maximum extent feasible from the scenic highway or the adjacent scenic or 
recreational resource. Screening should be provided by existing topography, by the strategic 
placement of buildings and structures, and by landscaping and plantings which are compatible 
with the local environment. 
E. ?Undergrounding of Utilities. 
1. ?New and existing utilities shall be constructed and routed underground except in those 
situations where natural features prevent the underground siting or where safety 
considerations or the size of the electrical lines necessitate aboveground construction and 
routing. 
2. ?Aboveground utilities shall be constructed and routed to minimize detrimental effects on the 
visual setting. Where practical, aboveground utilities shall be screened from view by 
existing topography or by existing topography, or by placement of buildings and structures. 
F. ?Grading. Grading shall conform with the ridgeline and grading development standards 
contained in Chapters 16.08 and 16.54, respectively, of this Development Code. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.57.030, 1995) 


Chapter 16.32 - SMALL LOT OVERLAY DISTRICT 
Sections: 


16.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The small lot (SL) overlay district is established to provide special development standards for 
subdivisions where substandard lots have been created through previous subdivision activity. The special 
standards are designed to ensure that the overall development intensity in areas where small lots exist 
does not exceed the ability of the City and other agencies to provide adequate services and facilities. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.59.010, 1995) 


16.32.020 - Locational criteria. 
A. ?The small lot overlay may be applied in areas predominated by lots or parcels legally established 
prior to the adoption of this Development Code which were not created through the use of the 
Planned Development process and where lots do not meet minimum size criteria as contained in this 
Development Code. The standards of the small lot overlay district shall apply to all lots within the 
boundaries of the district, regardless of their size. 
B. ?Areas in which the small lot overlay shall apply include the following: 
1. ?The Canon Lane area, including: 
a. ?Tract 1913

(Ord. 68 § 9.59.020, 1995) 


16.32.030 - Development standards. 
A. ?Front Yard Required. The front yard setback shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the front 
property line. 
B. ?Second Story Building Setback. The second story of the home shall be setback a minimum of five 
feet from the first story building face. 
C. ?Interior Side Yard Required. Interior side yards on each side of each lot shall be no less than five 
feet, provided there is at least ten (10) feet of separation between structures. 
D. ?Street Side Yard Setback. The street side yard setback for each lot shall be a minimum of five feet 
from the front property line. 
E. ?Rear Yard Setback. The rear yard setback for each lot shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from 
the rear property line. 
F. ?Lot Coverage by Building. The lot coverage by building for each lot shall be forty (40) percent 
maximum. 
G. ?Building Height. The maximum building height for each lot shall be thirty five (35) feet. 
H. ?Driveway Length. The driveway length for each lot shall be a minimum of nineteen (19) feet in 
length. For a side-loaded garage, the driveway length shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet. 
I. ?Dedication Requirement. Prior to the issuance of building permits, an offer of dedication and roadway 
improvements shall be made as required to meet the current City standards on all roads publicly 
owned and maintained. The City Engineer may at his discretion allow for the deposit of funds into the 
road trust in-lieu of construction of the required roadway improvement. 
(Ord. 194 § 3 (part), 2007: Ord. 68 § 9.59.030, 1995) 


16.32.040 - Special requirements. 
    The following requirements shall be met prior to the issuance of building permits for any lot within the 
small lot overlay district: 
A. ?Record of Ownership. To prove that the subject lots are or were owned by the same person, 
documentation shall be submitted showing the record ownership of the subject lots(s). 
B. ?Evidence of Water Service. A letter from the Engineering Department shall be submitted to the 
Community Development Department certifying that adequate line and storage capaCity exists 
or will exist to serve the proposed dwelling at the time of occupancy and that arrangements 
have been made to serve each dwelling with a potable water system. This requires that the 
water main be in place to serve the subject property or that financial arrangements have been 
made with the City for installation of the water main. 
C. ?Evidence of Sewer Service. Either (1) a letter from the City Engineer certifying that an adequate 
sanitary sewage disposal system exists or will exist, or (2) a letter from the County Department 
of Environmental Health Services that an adequate subsurface disposal systems exists or will 
exist to serve the proposed dwelling at the time of occupancy must be submitted. Where 
subsurface disposal is proposed, verification must be provided from the appropriate agency(ies) 
that the system meets or will comply with all applicable standards and codes. This may include 
but not be limited to submission of a percolation test. 
D. ?Survey Requirements. Each lot must be surveyed and staked in accordance with the provisions 
of the Land Surveyors Act by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, or evidence 
of a past survey shall be submitted to and approved by the County Surveyor as being in

Chapter 16.33 - EQUESTRIAN AND LARGE ANIMAL OVERLAY 
Sections: 


16.33.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A. ?Intent and purpose. The City of Chino Hills has a rich rural heritage of equestrian uses. Chapter 
16.33 is intended to preserve the City's equestrian heritage while establishing standards to ensure 
that the number of animals on a property, and associated uses and operations, do not create a 
negative impact on the environment and the surrounding community. The Equestrian and Large 
Animal Overlay District includes five different overlay categories throughout the City, namely "Level 
1", "Level 2", "Level 3", "Bayberry", and "Boys Republic". Each category is defined by specific 
locations within the City shown in Figure 1, Equestrian and Large Animal Overlay District Map below. 
Each overlay category has standards appropriate to the physical parameters of its location for 
maximum number of animals allowed, permitted uses, and best management practices in order to 
comply with water quality requirements. 
B. ?The following overlay districts are established in the Equestrian and Large Animal Overlay District: 
1. ?The Level 1 Overlay allows equestrian and large animal operations as an accessory use to a 
primary residential dwelling unit within the English Road area of the City's Agriculture Ranch 
General Plan land use designation areas. The City of Chino Hills' General Plan classifies the 
Agriculture Ranch land use designation as large lot residential development, suitable for 
equestrian estates. The Agriculture Ranch land use designation also allows for public and 
private stables and related uses as an accessory use to a primary residential dwelling unit. 
Given the historical equestrian commercial operations in the English Road community, and its 
Agriculture Ranch land use designation, the area is included in the Level 1 Overlay 
classification. 
2. ?The Level 2 Overlay provides for animal keeping and light equestrian and large animal 
operations as an accessory use to a primary residential dwelling unit. In order to ensure 
compatibility of land uses and preserve the quality of life for all residents, the Level 2 Overlay 
classification is proposed for low density residential and rural residential designated lots with a 
minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet of flat, usable topography and compatible for the 
keeping of large animals. This area is located between Eucalyptus Avenue and Soquel Canyon 
Parkway. 
3. ?The Level 3 Overlay provides for grazing on public and private open space land and vacant, 
undeveloped lots. Grazing on open space and undeveloped lands is part of the City's rural 
heritage. The Level 3 Overlay classification is proposed for large open space and undeveloped 
areas of five (5) acres or more, throughout the City that can support the grazing of large animals 
without the need to import feed. This allows for fuel modification in open space areas without 
the degradation of the land. 
4. ?The Bayberry Overlay has unique characteristics which deviate from the Level 2 Overlay, 
requiring specific and separate regulations. The Bayberry Overlay has existing large animal 
keeping uses on smaller lot sizes. These conditions require specific issues related to drainages 
and water quality, and existing unique animal uses. 
5. ?The Boys Republic Overlay is unique in that it is specific to the Boys Republic, which is an 
institutional and educational use that has historically included animal keeping operations, 
primarily of cows. As of the adoption of this Chapter 16.33, the Boys Republic site has four lots 
totaling one hundred ninety-three (193) acres. 
 
(Ord. No. 270, § 4.A, 4-8-2014; Ord. No. 274, § 3, 8-26-2014)

feeding large number of animals, and generally raising agricultural livestock for sale, slaughter, or milk 
production. 
    "Miniature animal" means a recognized adult large animal that is bred on a smaller scale than its 
larger scaled counterpart and which is at least half the size of a larger recognized "large animal." Two (2)

modifications, as appropriate), and any other conditions the Director may impose, as long 
as such modifications and conditions are reasonably necessary to ensure the project is 
consistent with the General Plan, compatible with surrounding land use, and meets the 
provisions and intent of this Code and other applicable law. 
4. ?If the findings required by subsection E below cannot be met, the Community Development 
Director shall deny the permit. 
E. ?Basis for Approval or Denial of Equestrian and Large Animal Keeping Permit. The Director shall

C. ?Permit approval attached to the property. An Equestrian and Large Animal Business Permit that is 
valid and in effect and granted pursuant to the provisions of this Development Code shall run with 
the land and shall continue to be valid upon change of ownership of the land, unless suspended or 
revoked by the City. 
D. ?Procedure for obtaining or modifying a permit.

(Ord. No. 270, § 4.A, 4-8-2014) 


16.33.070 - Equestrian and large animal use permit. 
A. ?Purpose. The City recognizes that certain uses, due to the nature of use, intensity, or size, require 
special review to determine if the use proposed, or the location of that use, is compatible with 
surrounding uses, or, through the imposition of development and use conditions, can be made 
compatible with surrounding uses. The Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit (EUP) is provided 
for the purpose of conditionally permitting more than the maximum animals per lot within each 
designated overlay permitted by right, and/or conditionally permitting certain types of animals not 
permitted by right, or conditionally permitting a commercial equestrian and large animal operation 
within the Level 2 Overlay. 
B. ?Application requirements. Applications for Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permits may be 
submitted only for those uses specified as EUP uses in Table 1 Permitted Uses and Animal Types. If 
the proposed use does not comply with applicable development standards, a separate Variance 
application shall be filed. The EUP and Variance applications may be processed concurrently. The 
application shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
i. ?Site Plan with dimensions showing dwelling unit(s) on or within one hundred (100) feet of the 
proposed animal keeping sites as well as all existing and proposed equestrian and large animal 
related structures including, but not limited to, barns, stables, arenas and rings. 
ii. ?Written proposed inventory of number of horses and other large animals and types and/or 
description of proposed commercial equestrian or large animal use. 
iii. ?Clean Water Equestrian Stewardship Program Certificate of Compliance. 
iv. ?Description of any proposed pasturing. 
v. ?Impact studies including traffic and noise, as determined to be reasonably necessary by the 
Director or his or her designee. 
C. ?Proceedings. 
1. ?An application shall be filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.58.020 of this Development 
Code. Upon acceptance of an Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit (EUP) application as 
complete, the Community Development Director or his or her designee shall review the 
application for conformance with the applicable policies of the Chino Hills General Plan and the 
provisions of this Development Code. If the application meets the requirements of this Code, the 
Community Development secretary shall schedule the matter for a public hearing before the 
Community Development Director pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 16.58 (Administrative 
Procedures) of this Development Code. Notice of the public hearing on all Equestrian and large 
animal use permit applications, shall be provided as set forth in Section 16.58.040 (Notice of 
public hearings). 
2. ?The Community Development Director shall hear and take action upon the application pursuant 
to the provisions of Chapter 16.58 of this Development Code. 
3. ?The Director shall act to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. 
D. ?Basis for approval or denial of Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit. The Director, and Planning 
Commission on appeal, in acting to approve an Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit application, 
may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure the project is consistent with the 
General Plan, compatible with surrounding land use, and meets the provisions and intent of this 
Development Code and other applicable law. In making such a determination, the hearing body shall 
find that the proposed use is in general in accord with the following principles and standards: 
1. ?That the proposed conditional use is consistent with the General Plan; 
2. ?That the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings, and structures have 
been considered, and that the use and number of animals will not adversely affect or be 
materially detrimental to these adjacent uses, buildings, or structures; 
3. ?That the site for the proposed conditional use is of adequate size and shape to accommodate 
the use and number of animals proposed; 
4. ?That the proposed conditional use complies with all applicable development standards of the 
zoning district and overlay district; 
5. ?That the proposed conditional use observes the spirit and intent of this Development Code; 
6. ?That the inventory of number of animals and types complies with the requirements of this Code; 
and 
7. ?That the Clean Water Equestrian Stewardship Program complies with the requirements of this 
Code including Chapter 13.16. 
E. ?Referral. The Director or designee may, at his or her discretion, refer the Equestrian and large 
animal use permit to the Planning Commission for review and approval. In this case, the Planning 
Commission shall have the authority to approve, deny, or conditionally approve the application. 
F. ?Time Limits. 
1. ?Use of Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit. Any EUP which is not used within the time 
specified in the grant of approval or, if no time is specified, within one year of the effective date 
of such approval, expires at the end of that period. The Planning Commission may extend such 
approval for a period of time not to exceed one year, provided an application requesting the 
extension is filed prior to the original extension date. For purposes of this section "used" means 
the commencement of construction activity or any activity authorized by the grant. 
2. ?Any applicant disputing the expiration of any EUP under this section must appeal within ten (10) 
working days of the expiration date. The appeal must follow the process set forth in Section 
16.58.060 of this Code. The appeal must be made to the Planning Commission for permits 
approved by the Planning Commission, and to the City Council for permits approved by the City 
Council. 
G. ?Permit Approval Attached to the Property. An Equestrian and Large Animal Use Permit that is valid 
and in effect and granted pursuant to the provisions of this Development Code shall run with the land 
and shall continue to be valid upon change of ownership of the land, unless suspended or revoked 
by the City pursuant to Section 16.33.100 below.

16.33.095 - Right of appeal. 
    Any decision made by the Director of Community Development or his or her designee pursuant to 
this chapter may be appealed to the Chino Hills Planning Commission in accordance with Section 
16.58.060 of the Chino Hills Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 270, § 4.A, 4-8-2014) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 270, § 4.A., adopted April 8, 2014, set out provisions intended for use 
as § 16.33.090. Inasmuch as the ordinance specified two such sections to be designated as 
16.33.090, at the editor's discretion, this section has been renumbered as § 16.33.095. 


16.33.100 - Enforcement. 
    The following applies to all permits issued pursuant to this Chapter: 
A. ?Inspections. The Community Development Director or his or her designee, or any official 
designated by the City to enforce the provisions of this Code, shall have the right at any time, 
upon reasonable request, and subject to any applicable protections under the United States 
Constitution or State Constitution, to enter and inspect any approved equestrian and large 
animal keeping area to determine compliance with any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter 
and the provisions of this Code. 
B. ?Reservation of Right to Review and Modify PermitChanged circumstances. The City, the 
Community Development Director, and the Planning Commission and City Council upon referral 
or appeal, retain and reserve the right and jurisdiction to review and to modify any permit issued 
or approved under this chapter including the conditions of approvalbased on changed 
circumstances. Changed circumstances include, but are not limited to, the modification of the 
use/business, a change in scope, size, number or types of animals, or nature of the 
use/business, or the expansion, alteration, reconfiguration, or change of use or a change in 
applicable federal, state or local law. If the Community Development Director deems such 
modifications are warranted, the Community Development Director shall cause notice of any 
such modification order to be served on the permit-holder by regular first-class U.S. mail and by 
posting the notice on the property. If no written objection is filed with the Community 
Development Director within twenty (20) days, the modification order shall become effective. If 
such a written objection is filed, the Community Development shall schedule the matter for a 
public hearing before the Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 16.58 
(Administrative Procedures) of this Development Code. Notice of the public hearing on changed 
circumstances shall be provided as set forth in Section 16.58.040 (Notice of public hearings). 
The Planning Commission shall hear and take action upon the application pursuant to the 
provisions of Chapter 16.58 of this Development Code, applying the applicable findings for such 
permit in this Chapter. The reservation of right to review and modify any permit issued or 
approved under this chapter by the City, the Community Development Director, the Planning 
Commission, and City Council is in addition to, and not in lieu of, the right of the City, the 
Community Development Director, the Planning Commission, and City Council to review and 
suspend or revoke any such permit pursuant to subsection C below. 
C. ?Suspension/revocation of permit. 
1. ?The Community Development Director or designee may issue an order suspending any 
permit issued pursuant to this Chapter pending a hearing before the Planning Commission 
upon a showing of probable cause by any official designated by the City to enforce the 
provisions of this Code of any of the following: 
a. ?That the permit was obtained by fraud, or that the applicant made a materially false 
representation on the subject application; or 
b. ?That the permit is being or recently has been exercised contrary to, or in violation of, 
the terms or conditions of such approval or other authorization; or 
c. ?That the permit is being or recently has been exercised in violation of any statute, law, 
or regulation; or 
d. ?That the use for which permit was granted, or other use(s) not directly related, is 
exercised in a manner detrimental to the public health and safety or in a manner 
which constitutes a nuisance. 
2. ?The Director shall cause notice of any such suspension order to be served on the permit-
holder by regular first-class U.S. mail and by posting the notice on the property. 
3. ?Whenever the Director has issued a suspension order, or whenever the Director suspects 
a violation but the requisite showing has not been made, the Director shall cause a noticed 
hearing to consider the revocation of a permit to be held by the Planning Commission 
within forty-five (45) days of the notice. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the permit-
holder, any party complaining of the violation, and to all adjoining residents and property 
owners. 
4. ?At the conclusion of the hearing, if the Planning Commission finds by a preponderance of 
the evidence that there is a violation of this Code or the conditions of any permit issued 
pursuant to this chapter, the Planning Commission may revoke the permit. If the Planning 
Commission does not so find, the Planning Commission shall order the termination of the 
suspension of the permit and order reinstatement of the permit. The decision of the 
Planning Commission may be appealed pursuant to Section 1.20.010 et seq., of the 
Municipal Code. The Director shall cause notice of the revocation or reinstatement order to 
be served on the permit-holder by regular first-class U.S. mail and by posting the notice on 
the property. 
D. ?Penalties. 
1. ?It is unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person, firm, or corporation to violate, disobey, 
omit, neglect, refuse to comply with, or resist the enforcement of any of the provisions of 
this chapter. Such behavior shall subject the violator to penalty as set forth in Section 
1.36.020 of this Code. Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. 
2. ?In addition to subsection 1 above, any violation of the provisions of this chapter or the 
conditions of operation of any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter are and shall be a 
public nuisance subject to abatement by the City through obtaining a court injunction from 
a court of competent jurisdiction or through the procedures set forth in Chapter 8.12 of this 
Code. 
(Ord. No. 270, § 4.A, 4-8-2014) 


Chapter 16.34 - PARKING AND LOADING 
Sections: 


16.34.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of the parking and loading regulations is to ensure that all land uses provide adequate 
off-street parking facilities and adequate facilities for vehicle movement and loading activities associated 
with a use. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the use of land does not negatively interfere 
with the use of and circulation on public rights-of-way, and that private on-site circulation does not pose a 
potential safety problem. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.65.010, 1995) 


16.34.020 - Applicability. 
A. ?The minimum standards of this chapter shall apply to all proposed land uses, buildings, and 
structures. 
B. ?The minimum standards of this chapter shall also apply to all proposed additions, enhancements, 
and modifications to existing land uses or structures. At the time the building or structure is added 
onto, enlarged, or the use is intensified so as to cause a need for additional parking, parking and 
loading spaces shall be provided for both the existing units and the modified or enlarged portions so 
as to conform to provisions of this chapter, except as indicated in subsection C of this section. 
C. ?Exemption for Existing Single-Family Homes. Structural additions or reconstruction project that is 
less than the fifty (50) percent of the square footage of the existing on-site buildings is not required to 
meet the parking requirement as indicated in Table 65-1, provided that the existing single-family 
home already provides two covered parking spaces. 
(Ord. 174 §§ 5, 6, 2005; Ord. 68 § 9.65.020, 1995) 


16.34.030 - Site plan and building permit required. 
A. ?A Site Plan shall be required for all required parking facilities. The plan shall consist of a detailed 
layout of the parking facility, site, and parking lot landscaping. The plan shall be accurately 
dimensioned, showing all required parking spaces, landscaped areas, driving aisles, ingress/egress 
points, etc. The Site Plan shall be submitted and reviewed in conjunction with any application for 
planning, land use, engineering, or building permit. 
B. ?A parking facility or driveway shall have building and engineering permits for the facility or driveway 
in accordance with applicable provisions contained in the Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.65.030, 1995) 


16.34.040 - Encroachment into right-of-way prohibited. 
    Land within the right-of-way of a proposed street or highway, or within the planned ultimate right-of-
way on a street or highway proposed to be widened, shall not be used to provide required parking and 
loading facilities. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.65.040, 1995) 


16.34.045 - Clear corner areas at street intersections and driveways for sight visibility. 
    See Section 16.06.080 of this Code. 
(Ord. 182 § 3(F), 2005) 


16.34.050 - Location of parking and loading facilities. 
A. ?Residential Uses. 
1. ?Required parking facilities for residential zone districts shall be located on the same lot or parcel 
of land as the use the parking facilities are intended to serve, or within a single development as 
approved by the Director of Community Development. The facilities shall be conveniently and 
safely located on the site. Required parking facilities provided by a given project shall be used 
exclusively for parking purposes by that project or residence, and shall not be leased, sold, or 
utilized by other projects or entities. 
2. ?Per Section 16.34.080 of this chapter, parking on unpaved areas is prohibited in all zoning 
districts. 
3. ?Within a required front yard area, vehicles may be parked only on a parking space as defined in 
Section 16.34.080 of this chapter. Vehicles parked within a front yard area may not extend past 
the right-of-way line at the front of the lot. 
4. ?Vehicles may be parked in a side or rear yard area, or within the buildable area of a lot on a 
parking space as defined in Section 16.34.080 of this chapter, provided that a minimum of three 
feet of clearance is provided between the vehicle and the adjacent outside wall of any structure 
containing windows. 
B. ?Nonresidential Uses. Required parking for nonresidential uses shall be located: 
1. ?On the same lot or parcel of land as the use which the facilities serve; or 
2. ?On an adjoining lot or parcel of land under the same ownership as the lot supporting the use the 
parking facilities serve, provided that the adjoining lot is merged with the property containing the 
primary use for which the parking is required; or a covenant of easement is recorded for parking 
purposes in accordance with Section 16.34.090(A); 
3. ?On a lot or parcel of land separated only by an alley (twenty (20) feet wide or less) from the lot 
or parcel supporting the use the parking facilities serve, provided: 
a. ?That such lots or parcels are under the same ownership; 
b. ?That such lots or parcels would be contiguous if not separated by the alley; 
c. ?That direct vehicular and pedestrian passage between such lots or parcels would be 
possible if the alley were vacated; 
d. ?That the parking and vehicular access on such lots or parcels can be designed to ensure 
safe pedestrian movement between the parking and the property containing the primary 
use it is intended to serve; and 
e. ?That a covenant of easement is recorded for parking purposes in accordance with Section 
16.34.090(A). 
(Ord. 68 § 9.65.050, 1995) 


16.34.060 - Number of parking spaces required. 
A. ?Required Spaces. 
1. ?Table 65-1 specifies the number of off-street parking spaces required for specific uses. The 
requirement for a use not specifically mentioned shall be the same as for a specified use which 
has the most similar traffic and/or parking-generating characteristics. The Community 
Development Director shall determine what constitutes similar traffic-generating characteristics. 
2. ?As provided in Chapter 16.72 (Minor Variances) of this Code, the Director of Community 
Development may approve up to a thirty (30) percent reduction in the number of required 
parking spaces. Reductions of more than thirty (30) percent may be approved by the Planning 
Commission, as provided in Chapter 16.70 (Major Variances). 
B. ?Fractional Spaces. If the calculation of required parking spaces results in a fractional number, that 
number shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

B. ?For signs oriented to a vehicular way, such signs shall have a minimum letter height in 
accordance with Table 1. For each additional thirty (30) feet from the street right-of-way, the 
minimum letter height shall be increased by one inch in order to be legible from the street. For 
example, if a sign is located sixty (60) feet from the right-of-way along a street with a speed limit 
of thirty-five (35) mph, the minimum letter height would be: 9 inches + (60 feet - 30 feet) &times 
1 inch/30 feet = 10 inches.

Editor's note Ord. No. 302, § 3, adopted Nov. 8, 2016, amended former Ch. 16.44, §§ 16.44.010
16.44.140, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 16.44 pertained to similar subject matter 
and derived from Ord. No. 139, §§ 9.81.0209.81.300, 2000; Ord. No. 292, §§ 21, 22, 11-24-2015. 


16.44.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of these requirements and guidelines is to regulate the location and design of "wireless 
communication facilities" as defined in this chapter to protect the public safety, the general welfare, and 
the quality of life in the City of Chino Hills, including preserving the character of the neighborhood and 
avoiding aesthetic blight. The City Council has found and determined that these requirements and 
guidelines for wireless communication facilities are necessary to attain such purpose. These regulations 
are intended to supersede applicable provisions of the City Municipal Code pertaining to antenna 
structures and appurtenant communications equipment and to establish minimum requirements and 
flexible guidelines for the governance of wireless communication facilities, taking into consideration the 
rapid technological advances and the proliferation in use of wireless communication services. The 
standards are intended to address adverse visual impacts and operational effects of these facilities 
through appropriate design, siting, screening techniques and locational standards while providing for the 
communication needs of residents, local businesses, and government agencies. This chapter provides a 
mechanism to ensure that all wireless communication facilities shall be erected, located, modified, 
operated and maintained at all times in compliance with this chapter and all applicable laws and 
regulations of the City of Chino Hills, the State of California, and the United States of America. This article 
is not intended to, and does not, address or regulate health impacts associated with telecommunication 
projects.

shall be placed on the real property on which the facility was located for the full amount of the cost of 
removal, repair, restoration, and storage. The Director of Community Development shall cause the 
lien to be recorded in the County of San Bernardino Recorder's Office.

A. ?Noise Measurement. Noise will be measured with a sound level meter which meets the standards of 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Section S14-1979, Type I or Type 2. Noise levels 
shall be measured using the "A" weighted sound pressure level scale in decibels (reference pressure 
= 20 micronewtons per meter squared). The unit of measure shall be designated as dB(A). The City 
Engineer shall be the noise control officer. 
B. ?Noise Standards. 
1. ?The noise standards contained in Table N-1 "Noise/Land Use Compatibility Matrix" in the Noise 
Element of the General Plan shall apply to land uses Citywide and shall be used to define 
acceptable and unacceptable noise levels. 
2. ?No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound at any location or allow 
the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by such 
person, which causes the noise level, when measured on any other property, either 
incorporated or unincorporated, to exceed: 
a. ?The "Zone C" noise standard for that receiving land use specified in Table N-1 of the 
General Plan Noise Element for a cumulative period of more than thirty (30) minutes in any 
hour; or 
b. ?The noise standard plus 5 dBA for a cumulative period of more than five minutes in any 
hour; or

Chapter 16.50 - GRADING REGULATIONS 
Sections: 


16.50.010 - Purpose. 
    Chino Hills derives its identity and character from its hillside setting and diverse topographic forms. 
The City's General Plan emphasizes the preservation and enhancement of the natural features which 
contribute to the scenic qualities of the area. The grading standards and guidelines contained in this 
chapter are established to preserve the hillside character of the community. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.91.010, 1995) 


16.50.020 - Scope of regulations. 
    Where the words "shall" or "will" are used in this chapter, the stated standards shall be mandatory. 
Where the words "should," "could," or similar language is used, the provisions shall be considered 
guidelines only, unless required by the Community Development Director, Planning Commission, or City 
Council through a discretionary approval process. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.91.020, 1995) 


16.50.030 - Grading guidelines applicable to all projects. 
    The grading standards listed in this section and illustrated in Figures 93-1 through 93-9 shall be 
required of all development projects, as approved by the Director of Community Development. 
A. ?The overall shape, height, and grade of any cut or fill slope shall be designed to simulate the 
existing natural contours and scale of the natural terrain of the site. 
B. ?The angle of the graded slope shall be gradually adjusted to the angle of the natural terrain. 
C. ?Sharp, angular forms shall be rounded and smoothed to blend with the natural terrain. 
D. ?Graded slopes shall be landscaped. 
E. ?Natural drainage courses shall be preserved whenever practicable, consistent with the need to 
minimize flood and erosion hazards. Stream banks shall be stabilized with landscaping, rock, or 
other materials that harmonize with the natural setting and contain flows and control erosion. 
F. ?During construction, measures shall be taken to control runoff from construction sites consistent 
with National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) requirements imposed by the 
State Regional Water Quality Control Board and Chapter 16.54 of this Code. 
G. ?Grading shall be phased so that prompt revegetation or construction can control erosion. 
Where possible, only those areas which will later be resurfaced, landscaped, or built on should 
be disturbed. Resurfacing of parking lots and roadways shall take place as soon as practicable 
and not at the completion of construction. 
H. ?Grading operations should be planned to avoid the rainy season. Grading during the rainy 
season shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 16.54 of this Code. 
I. ?Grading plans shall show the location of any abandoned oil wells, including wells not covered by 
structures. Prior to issuance of grading permits, the project proponent shall develop, in 
consultation with the State Department of Conservation, Division of Oil and Gas, an 
abandonment process which meets current state abandonment standards, and shall submit 
evidence to the Building Official of state approval of the process. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.91.030, 1995) 


16.50.040 - Grading guidelines for all projects. 
    Within the framework of the standards listed in Section 16.50.030, the City has developed guidelines 
to illustrate more desirable approaches to grading. These guidelines are intended to provide more specific 
direction on the intent of the grading standards. These guidelines are not requirements, but are provided 
to illustrate preferred approaches to grading; application of these standards shall be determined during 
the approval process for each project, including the issuance of grading permits. 
A. ?The toe and crest of any slope in excess of ten (10) feet vertical height should be rounded with 
vertical curves of radii no less than five feet and designed in proportion to the total height of the 
slope. 
B. ?Where cut or fill slopes over five feet in vertical height exceed one hundred (100) feet in 
horizontal length, the contours of the slope should be curved in a continuous, undulating fashion 
with varying radii to reflect the natural terrain. 
C. ?A manufactured slope bank should not exceed thirty (30) feet in vertical height unless no 
feasible alternative exists or unless grading can be significantly reduced by increasing slope 
height. However, the use of an alternative design is strongly recommended as the desirable 
approach in reducing grading and slope height. Any bank exceeding twenty-five (25) feet in 
height, regardless of length, should have variable gradients, unless the City requires a 
maximum 2:1 slope gradient due to onsite soil conditions. 
D. ?The provisions of subsection A and B above generally do not apply to side yard slopes (that is, 
slopes between residential lots) except where the side yard slope is highly visible. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.91.040, 1995) 


16.50.050 - Landscaping adjacent to open space areas. 
    The transition zone between development and the natural terrain shall be landscaped to accomplish 
the following general functions as required: 
A. ?Screening or edge treatment, i.e., berming and planting to buffer and soften the land use 
transition. Planting shall be consistent with the character established for the area in which the 
project is located; 
B. ?Erosion Control. See approved planting lists, especially ground covers, in this Development 
Code and the City of Chino Hills Landscape Manual; 
C. ?Fuel modification, per the standards of the City of Chino Hills and the Fire Authority; 
D. ?Skyline Enhancement. Plantings shall generally replicate the natural form of the ridgeline. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.91.050, 1995) 


16.50.060 - Grading on prominent knolls and ridgelines and Carbon Canyon area. 
    Grading in the vicinity of prominent knolls and ridgelines, and in the Carbon Canyon area (as defined 
in Section 16.08.050(A)(2) shall conform to the standards contained in Chapter 16.08 of this Code.

otherwise) to, or financial interest in the developer, or any contracting, engineering or geotechnical 
companies performing work on or providing services to the project being inspected. 
C. ?The Quality Control Engineer shall be responsible for inspection of the work in progress to assure 
compliance with the conditions of approval which may include, but are not limited to slope ratio, 
slope height, slope location, areas of land disturbance and/or set provisions regarding archeology, 
paleontology, landscaping, erosion control, protection of native plants and animals, or any other 
conditions of approval which will control or impact grading. The quality control engineer shall report 
to and file reports after each inspection or (if continuous inspections are necessary) weekly with the 
Building Official as required by the Building Official. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.92.030, 1995) 


16.52.040 - Developer's deposit. 
    Prior to the issuance of the grading permit, the developer shall post a deposit with the Building 
Official in the amount and in the form specified by the Building Official. The deposit funds held in trust 
shall be dispersed to the quality control engineer by the Building Official under the terms of the agreement 
between the City and the quality control engineer to pay for the services of the quality control engineer. 
The Building Official will notify the developer if and when it becomes apparent that the deposit will be 
exhausted and the developer shall make such additional deposit as required by the Building Official. If the 
developer fails to submit such additional deposit by the date specified by the Building Official, the Building 
Official shall suspend or revoke the grading permit, in accordance with the provisions of the California 
Building Code and order that work on the project cease. Upon completion of the work, unused funds shall 
be returned to the developer within sixty (60) days following the final grading and quality control 
inspection approvals. Billings shall be in accordance with the City's accounting procedures. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.92.040, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 225, § 3A, 6-9-2009) 


16.52.050 - Building Official authority. 
    The Building Official shall have authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations to clarify, 
interpret and enforce the provisions of this chapter. The Building Official may approve variations when 
such variations are not detrimental to the life, health, safety or welfare of the public and are necessary 
because of particular or peculiar circumstances, and will achieve the same level of protection as the 
original condition. Variations of the environmental conditions shall be applied for and processed in the 
same manner as other grading variations. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.92.050, 1995) 


16.52.060 - Authority to contract. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the Building Official may retain, on behalf of the City, independent 
engineers to serve as the quality control engineer on projects regulated by this chapter using a standard 
form contract approved by the City. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.92.060, 1995) 


16.52.070 - Noncompliance. 
    The Building Official is authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this chapter and may use 
any legal means to affect such enforcement, including suspending and/or revoking any permits that have 
been issued by the Building Official for the project, whether or not the permits are for the earthwork 
grading, and withholding issuance of any permits on the project for which applications have been filed. 
The Building Official is further authorized to expend any remaining funds in the developer's deposit to 
obtain compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.92.070, 1995)

A. ?Identify building and access construction envelopes and identify areas which will not be 
disturbed by construction activity in order to minimize disturbance of erodible areas of any 
proposed development site. 
B. ?The preservation of existing streams and drainage courses in their natural condition in order to 
retain their ability to accommodate runoff and water drainage with a minimum of erosion. 
C. ?All appropriate measures that will facilitate the preparation of an adequate soil erosion and 
sediment control plan and/or permit measures as specified by this chapter. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.93.040, 1995) 


16.54.050 - Soil erosion and sediment control plan. 
A. ?No land clearing or grading other than those activities listed as exemptions by this chapter or as 
determined by the Building Official shall occur unless the such clearing or grading is in compliance 
with an approved soil erosion and sediment control plan and/or permit issued in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter. 
B. ?A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted and approved in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter prior to the issuance of building permits, soil erosion and sediment control 
permits, grading permits or any other permit where, in the opinion of the Building Official, erosion can 
reasonably be expected to occur. 
C. ?Soil erosion and sediment control plans shall include the measures required by this chapter. 
Additional measures or modifications of proposed measures may be required by the Building Official 
prior to the approval of a soil erosion and sediment control plan. 
D. ?The Building Official shall specify the application requirement for soil erosion and sediment control 
plans and permits including, but not limited to: 
1. ?Requirements for the submittal of plans and supporting data as required by the Building Official 
to accompany applications for soil erosion and sediment control plans and/or permits; 
2. ?Licensing and/or certification requirements for those preparing soil erosion and sediment control 
plan and/or permit submittal; and 
3. ?The incorporation and coordination of soil erosion control plans and/or permits with other plan 
requirements. 
E. ?If in the Building Official's sole discretion he or she determines that no land disturbance will take 
place, the applicant shall not be required to include a soil erosion and sediment control plan and/or 
permit. Such activities may include, but are not limited to: 
1. ?Change of use permits where there would be no expansion of land-disturbing activities. 
2. ?Construction within an existing structure. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.93.050, 1995) 


16.54.060 - Runoff control. 
    Runoff from activities subject to a development permit shall be properly controlled to prevent erosion. 
Erosion control and surface flow containment facilities shall be constructed and maintained to prevent 
discharge of sediment into surface waters or storm drainage systems. The following measures shall be 
used for runoff control, and shall be designed and maintained to control runoff from a ten (10) year storm: 
A. ?Where soils having a permeability rate of more than two inches per hour, runoff in excess of 
predevelopment levels shall be retained on the site by methods and in quantities approved by 
the Building Official. This may be accomplished through the use of infiltration basins, percolation 
pits or trenches, or other suitable means. This requirement may be waived where the Building 
Official determines that high groundwater, slope stability problems, etc., would inhibit or be 
aggravated by on-site retention, or where retention will provide no benefits for groundwater 
recharge or erosion control. 
B. ?Where soils have a permeability rate of two inches per hour or less and on-site percolation is 
not feasible, runoff should be detained or dispersed over nonerodible vegetated surfaces so that 
the runoff rate does not exceed the predevelopment level. When the runoff rate must exceed 
the predevelopment level, the runoff water shall be discharged over nonerodible surfaces or at a 
veloCity that will not erode. On-site detention shall be required by the Building Official unless 
the applicant shows that the runoff which is created will not contribute to downstream erosion, 
flooding or sedimentation. 
C. ?Any concentrated runoff which cannot be effectively dispersed over nonerodible channels or 
conduits to the nearest drainage course shall be contained within on-site percolation devices. 
Where water will be discharged to natural ground or channels, appropriate energy dissipators 
shall be installed to prevent erosion at the point of discharge. 
D. ?Runoff from disturbed areas shall be detained or filtered by berms, vegetated filter strips, catch 
basins, or other means as necessary to prevent the escape of sediment from the disturbed 
area. 
E. ?No earth, organic or construction material shall be deposited or placed where it may be directly 
carried into a stream, lake, marsh, slough, lagoon or body of water. 
F. ?Where land-disturbing activities are in proximity to lakes or natural watercourses, a buffer zone 
is required along the land-water margin of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within 
twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activities. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.93.060, 1995) 


16.54.070 - Land clearing. 
    Land clearing shall be kept to a minimum. Vegetation removal shall be limited to that amount 
necessary for building, access, fire protection and construction as shown on the approved soil erosion 
and sediment control plan or as allowed by the Building Official through a soil erosion and sediment 
control permit. 
A. ?All disturbed surfaces shall be prepared and maintained to control erosion and to establish 
vegetative growth compatible with the area. This control shall consist of any one or a 
combination of the following: 
1. ?Effective temporary planting such as rye grass, or some other fast-germinating native seed, 
and/or mulching with straw, chippings or other slope stabilization material; 
2. ?Permanent planting of compatible drought-resistant species of ground cover, shrubs, trees, 
or other vegetation; 
3. ?Mulching, fertilizing, watering or other methods necessary to establish new vegetation. 
B. ?The protection required by this section shall be installed prior to calling for final approval of the 
project and at all times between October 15th and April 15th. Such protection shall be 
maintained for at least one year or until permanent protection is established. 
C. ?No land clearing activities except as otherwise allowed by this chapter shall take place prior to 
approval of the erosion control plan and/or permit. Vegetation removal between October 15th 
and April 15th shall not precede subsequent grading or construction activities by more than 
fifteen (15) days. During the period of October 15th to April 15th, erosion and sediment control 
measures shall be in place. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.93.070, 1995) 


16.54.080 - Winter operations. 
A. ?1. ?The Building Official shall only authorize the following between October 15th and April 15th 
when it is found that such projects comply with the provisions and are consistent with the 
purposes of this chapter: 
a. ?Contiguous land clearing operations involving greater than one acre in a one-year period of 
time; and 
b. ?Major grading operations (greater than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards). 
2. ?When construction will be delayed due to the limitation on winter operations, the date for 
expiration of the permit shall be extended by that amount of time that work is delayed by the 
requirements of this chapter. 
B. ?The Building Official shall stamp or attach the following statement to all development permits and 
plans issued within areas subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
?NOTICE: IF THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY WILL EXTEND INTO THE WINTER OPERATIONS 
PERIOD (OCTOBER 15 THROUGH APRIL 15), ADDITIONAL SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT 
CONTROL MEASURES MAY BE REQUIRED. 
?ANY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WHICH IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AN APPROVED SOIL 
EROSION CONTROL PLAN SHALL HAVE SUCH APPROVED PLAN AMENDED IF IT DOES NOT 
COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS ESTABLISHED FOR WINTER OPERATION BY SECTION 
16.54.080 OF THE CITY OF CHINO HILLS DEVELOPMENT CODE. ALL REQUIRED WINTER 
OPERATION EROSION CONTROL DEVICES SHALL BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO OCTOBER 15 
FOR ONGOING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND PRIOR TO ANY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY 
FOR THOSE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COMMENCING BETWEEN OCTOBER 15 AND APRIL 
15. 
C. ?The following winter operation measures shall be taken to prevent accelerated erosion. Additional 
measures may be required by the Building Official, when determined to be necessary by field 
inspection: 
1. ?Between October 15th and April 15th, disturbed surfaces not involved in the immediate 
operation shall be protected by mulching or other effective means of soil protection; 
2. ?All roads and driveways shall have drainage facilities sufficient to prevent erosion on or adjacent 
to the roadway or on downhill properties. Erosion-resistant surfacing may include, but is not 
limited to slag, crushed rock or natural soil when compacted to ninety (90) percent of maximum 
density as determined by Test D1557-58T of the American Society for Testing and Materials, as 
amended from time to time, for the top twelve (12) inches; 
3. ?Runoff from a site shall be detained or filtered by berms, vegetated filter strips, or catch basins 
to prevent the escape of sediment from the site. These drainage controls shall be maintained by 
the permittee or property owner as necessary to achieve their purpose throughout the life of the 
project; and 
4. ?Erosion control measures shall be in place at all times and by the end of each day's work on 
surfaces under construction. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.93.080, 1995) 


16.54.090 - Continued responsibility. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the property owner and the permittee to ensure that accelerated

conditions of such approval or other authorization; or 
3. ?That the HOP is being, or has been, exercised in violation of any statute, law, or regulation; or 
4. ?That the use for which the HOP was granted, or other use(s) not directly related, is exercised in 
a manner detrimental to the public health and safety or in a manner which constitutes a 
nuisance. 
    Then the Community Development Director may issue an order suspending the HOP. Such 
suspension/revocation order must contain a notice to the permit holder that the permit holder has a right 
to appeal the suspension before an impartial hearing officer within thirty (30) days. If the suspension is 
not appealed within thirty (30) days, then the suspension shall become a permanent revocation. The 
Director shall cause notice of the suspension/revocation order to be served on the permit-holder by 
regular first-class U.S. mail and by posting the notice on the property where the home occupation is 
conducted. 
B. ?If the permit holder files an appeal of the suspension/revocation order with the City Clerk within thirty 
(30) days of the order, then the City Manager must designate an impartial hearing officer by 
appointment or contract. The Director shall cause a noticed hearing to consider the revocation of the

information as is requested by the Community Development Director or his or her designee. 
The accuracy of all information, maps, and lists submitted shall be the responsibility of the 
applicant. The Director or his or her designee may reject any application that does not supply 
the following information: 
a. ?Name and address of the applicant; 
b. ?Evidence that the applicant: 
i. ?Is the owner of the premises involved, 
ii. ?Has written permission of the owner or owners to make the application,

e. ?The nature and specifics of the requested land use action. 
2. ?The following requirements shall apply to applications for Site Plan approvals and Conditional

and the effect the proposed use may have on those uses, buildings, and structures; 
b. ?Explain why the requested use will not cause negative impacts; endanger or otherwise 
imperil the public health, safety, or general welfare; and will not be materially detrimental to 
the property of other persons located in the vicinity of the proposed use; 
c. ?Provide a Site Plan indicating the area and dimensions of the proposed site for the 
requested use, and the location and dimensions of all uses, structures, yards, walls, 
fences, parking and loading facilities, landscaping, and other development features. 
3. ?The following additional information may be requested: 
a. ?Architectural renderings and plans, including elevations and proposed facade materials 
and colors;

i. ?Two copies of a map, drawn to scale, showing the location of all property included in 
the request, the location of all highways, streets, and alleys and the location and 
dimensions of all lots or parcels of land within a distance of three hundred (300) feet 
from the exterior boundaries of the subject property. One copy of such map shall 
indicate where such ownerships are located. 
ii. ?A notarized list of the names and addresses of all persons who are shown on the 
latest available assessment roll of the County of San Bernardino as owners of 
property within a distance of three hundred (300) feet from the exterior boundaries of 
the area actually to be occupied by the use. 
4. ?An application for major Variance or minor Variance shall include evidence to substantiate the 
basis for approval as provided in Sections 16.70.060 and 16.72.060, respectively. 
G. ?Withdrawal of an Application. Any application or petition for a land use action may be withdrawn at 
any time prior to a public hearing by filing with the Community Development Director a written 
request for withdrawal. The request for withdrawal shall be signed by all persons who signed the 
original application, or their designated agents or successors. Any such application or petition may 
be withdrawn after commencement of a hearing thereon, with approval of the hearing body. 
H. ?Inactive Application Deemed Withdrawn. When a project application is not active (the submittal of 
plans, technical studies, or other project-related documents) for one hundred twenty (120) days, the 
Community Development Department will send a letter to the applicant(s) advising that the 
application is inactive and subject to being deemed withdrawn. If a further sixty (60) days passes 
without project activity, the application shall be deemed withdrawn and any proposal to resume the 
project thereafter will require a new application. Alternatively, an additional one hundred eighty (180) 
days will be allowed for the processing of the project if a letter signed by the applicant(s) is submitted 
to the Community Development Department indicating that the applicant intends to pursue the 
application and will resume project-related activity within that time. The letter requesting the 
extension must be received by the Community Development Department prior to the automatic 
withdrawal as indicated above and shall be approved by the Community Development Director or his 
or her designee. One such extension may be approved.

whose property might, in the Director's judgment, be affected by the establishment of the use or 
zone requested. 
3. ?If the Director finds that the posting and mailing of notices prescribed elsewhere in this section 
may not give sufficient notice to the required property owners, then additional notices shall be 
posted at such locations as are deemed best suited to reach the attention of and inform those 
persons who may be affected. 
4. ?When the proposed use or amendment affects more than one thousand (1,000) property

    The City recognizes that certain uses, due to the nature of use, intensity, or size, require special 
review to determine if the use proposed, or the location of that use, is compatible with surrounding uses, 
or, through the imposition of development and use conditions, can be made compatible with surrounding 
uses. The Conditional Use Permit is provided for this purpose. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.130.010, 1995) 


16.68.020 - Application requirements. 
    Applications for Conditional Use Permits may be submitted only for those uses specified as 
conditional uses in the applicable zoning district in Appendix A: Regulation of Uses by Zoning District. If

may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure the project is consistent with the General 
Plan, compatible with surrounding land use, and meets the provisions and intent of this Development 
Code. In making such a determination, the hearing body shall find that the proposed use is in general in 
accord with the following principles and standards: 
A. ?That the proposed conditional use is consistent with the General Plan; 
B. ?That the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings, and structures have 
been considered, and that the use will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to these 
adjacent uses, buildings, or structures; 
C. ?That the site for the proposed conditional use is of adequate size and shape to accommodate 
the use and buildings proposed;

approval for a period of time not to exceed one year, provided an application requesting the 
extension is filed prior to the original expiration date. For purposes of this section "used" means the 
commencement of construction activity or any activity authorized by the grant. 
B. ?[Expiration; Appeal.] Any applicant disputing the expiration of any Conditional Use Permit under this

change in scope, emphasis, size, or nature of the business, or the expansion, alteration, reconfiguration, 
or change of use. The reservation of right to review any permit granted or approved under this chapter by

16.68.090 - New Conditional Use Permit requiredNew uses in existing centers. 
    Prior to the adoption of this Development Code, Conditional Use Permits were issued for 
retail/commercial centers as opposed to individual uses within the centers. This section requires issuance 
of a new Conditional Use Permit for any new use for which a Conditional Use Permit is required by the 
provisions of this Development Code which proposes to operate in a commercial or retail center in the 
City, whether or not a Conditional Use Permit was issued by San Bernardino County or the City on a 
center-wide basis. Such new Conditional Use Permit shall be specific as to the site, suite, store, or 
location, and shall authorize the use permitted thereunder.

Chapter 16.72 - MINOR VARIANCES 
Sections: 


16.72.010 - Purpose. 
A. ?The Variance procedure is provided pursuant to Section 65906 of the California Government Code 
to grant relief from zoning provisions when, because of special circumstances applicable to a 
property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of this 
Development Code deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and 
under the identical zoning classification. 
B. ?The City has established two types of Variance applications: major Variances and minor Variances. 
This chapter addresses minor Variances. Major Variances are addressed in the preceding Chapter 
16.70. 
C. ?Variances shall not be granted to authorize a use or activity on a property which is not otherwise 
expressly authorized by the provisions of this Development Code governing that property. A 
Variance is not a substitute for a zone change or zone text amendment. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.140.010, 1995) 


16.72.020 - Proposed actions subject to minor Variance application. 
A. ?A minor Variance application shall be filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.58.020 whenever 
any of the following deviations from the provisions of this Development Code is proposed: 
1. ?Up to a thirty (30) percent reduction in the number of required parking or loading spaces; 
2. ?Up to a forty (40) percent reduction of the required front yard, provided that a setback of at least 
fifteen (15) feet to the front property line is maintained; 
3. ?Up to a forty (40) percent reduction of the required side yard setback, provided that a setback of 
at least three feet is maintained, consistent with the requirements of the applicable fire overlay;

5. ?Up to a thirty (30) percent deviation from the required lot coverage standard; 
6. ?Up to a thirty (30) percent increase in the maximum height; 
7. ?Any wall height increase (excluding walls within the front yard setback) that does not exceed six 
feet above the highest adjacent grade shall be considered a minor Variance; and 
8. ?Up to a fifty (50) percent increase in the maximum coverage in front yard by impervious 
surfaces for properties with a lot width of less than fifty (50) feet or with an irregular frontage 
(such as a cul-de-sac lot), as reasonably required to provide a driveway and walkway. 
9. ?Any request to provide a carport as opposed to a garage in the RS low density residential 
zoning district, including small lot overlay zone.

Chapter 16.74 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 
Sections: 


16.74.010 - Purpose. 
A. ?The Planned Development (PD) process is established: (1) to facilitate the development of 
properties where greater flexibility in design would provide a more efficient use of the land, and (2) to 
provide for the detailed planning and design of some land uses over and above that which would 
otherwise be required. 
B. ?Where it is used as part of a land use planning process for a development process, Planned 
Development encourages the creative and imaginative planning of integrated, mixed-use 
developments which provide a balance of residential, commercial, industrial, open space, and 
support land uses. 
C. ?Where it is used in conjunction with a development project (a Conditional Use Permit, Tentative 
Map, or other project), Planned Development is used to provide detailed Site Planning, landscaping, 
and other requirements and standards which will govern a particular project. 
D. ?Once approved, a Planned Development will contain land use regulations and development 
standards that replace certain provisions of this Development Code. In a sense, each PD will be a 
mini-Development Code for the properties that it governs. Thus, a Planned Development ordinance 
must contain sufficient detail to allow City staff to implement its provisions and to describe to 
developers how properties within a Planned Development may be developed. Where no specific 
standard is contained in a Planned Development ordinance (for example, parking or landscaping 
standards), the applicable provisions of the Development Code shall govern. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.010, 1995) 


16.74.020 - Projects which require the preliminary and final development plan process. 
    A preliminary and final development plan shall be required for each of the following types of projects: 
A. ?Any project where the applicant proposes development of a type which cannot be achieved 
through the use of standards (including, but not limited to: lot sizes, setbacks, or land use types) 
as contained in this Code. 
B. ?Any Conditional Use Permit involving the construction of new buildings, even if the proposed 
development can be built in conformance with the standards contained in this Code. Conditional 
use permits involving the placement of a use in an existing building shall not require a 
preliminary or final development plan. 
C. ?Any other project which the Director of Community Development determines, at his or her sole 
discretion, would benefit from the use of the preliminary/final development plan process. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.020, 1995) 


16.74.030 - Two-step application process. 
    The application process for Planned Developments shall consist of a two-step approach involving a 
preliminary development plan (PDP) and a final development plan (FDP), as outlined in Figure 145-1 and 
described in the following sections. Applications for both preliminary development plans and final 
development plans shall be submitted as specified in Section 16.58.020 of this Development Code. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.030, 1995) 
 
Figure 145-1. 
Planned Development Process


16.74.040 - Preliminary development plan. 
A. ?Purpose. The preliminary development plan (PDP) functions as a development suitability analysis 
and comprehensive plan for the proposed development. As such, the PDP shall provide the 
information outlined in this section. 
B. ?Required Scope and Contents. The PDP shall set forth in text, maps, and diagrams the following, 
unless determined by the Director of Community Development to be unnecessary for a particular 
project: 
1. ?An existing setting description which includes: 
a. ?A description of the physical characteristics of the site, 
b. ?Available public services and facilities, 
c. ?The capaCity of the existing circulation system, and 
d. ?The existing and planned land use of adjacent properties; 
2. ?A discussion of specific objectives and limits for development of the property which recognize 
and respond to identified constraints; 
3. ?Proposed land uses which correspond to the land use categories established by the General 
Plan, and a statement of how the PDP relates to the General Plan; 
4. ?A land use and circulation plan; 
5. ?The distribution of land uses expressed in terms of acreage and the total number of residential 
units allowed; 
6. ?The density ranges of residential uses to correspond to density ranges established in the 
General Plan; 
7. ?a. ?Development standards for each of the proposed land use categories, including, but not 
limited to, regulations for setbacks, building heights, site coverage, parking, provision of 
open space, and grading, 
b. ?To the greatest extent possible, the PDP shall utilize the development standards 
established for the zoning districts most closely related to the uses proposed by the PDP. 
Deviations shall be permitted only where the applicant can justify that such deviation will 
enhance the quality of development, or is absolutely necessary to respond to conditions at 
the site; 
8. ?The level of public services and facilities required to serve the proposed development; 
9. ?Access requirements; 
10. ?Significant natural features and areas to be retained for common open space, and provisions 
for preserving, maintaining, and using those area; 
11. ?Known manmade and natural hazards, and the methods for mitigating the hazards. 
C. ?Process for Reviewing PDP. 
1. ?Prior to the formal submission of a PDP, the applicant shall meet with the Director of Community 
Development or his or her designee for the purpose of acquainting the applicant with the 
Planned Development process and its requirements. 
2. ?A completed PDP application shall be submitted to the Department of Community Development 
as set forth in Section 16.58.020 of this Development Code. 
3. ?The completed PDP application shall be processed in the manner prescribed for a Development 
Code amendment, as outlined in Chapter 16.62 of this Development Code. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.040, 1995) 


16.74.050 - Final development plan. 
A. ?Purpose. The purpose of the final development plan (FDP) is to allow for further definition of planned 
uses of individual properties within an approved preliminary development plan, and to allow those 
properties to be developed in phases, provided each phase can function as a complete and separate 
development from the remaining phases. 
B. ?Form and Content of Final Development Plan. 
1. ?The FDP shall be a detailed Site Plan which sets forth the location and dimensions of all uses 
and structures on a property in sufficient detail to permit preparation of construction drawings. In 
the case of a Tentative Tract Map, individual housing units need not be shown, unless 
determined necessary by the Director of Community Development. 
2. ?The FDP shall comply with all provisions of an approved PDP. 
C. ?Processing of a Final Development Plan. The Director of Community Development or his or her 
designee shall be responsible for reviewing all final development plans for compliance with an 
approved preliminary development plan. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.050, 1995) 


16.74.060 - Findings required for a preliminary development plan. 
    The Planning Commission and City Council shall be required to make the following findings of fact 
before approving a preliminary development plan: 
A. ?That the proposed PDP is consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives of the General 
Plan; and 
B. ?That a proposed PDP will not adversely affect surrounding properties. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.060, 1995) 


16.74.070 - Concurrent subdivision applications. 
    Applications for a Planned Development shall not constitute an application for a land division 
pursuant to the provisions of Title 16 of the Municipal Code. If a subdivision of land is proposed in 
conjunction with a Planned Development, a separate application and review shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of Title 16. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.145.070, 1995) 


Chapter 16.76 - SITE PLAN APPROVAL 
Sections: 


16.76.010 - Purpose. 
    The City recognizes that new development, in order to provide for safe and efficient circulation, 
compatibility with surrounding uses, attractive and efficient designs, and the provision of required 
landscaping, open space, and other areas, requires the formal review and approval of a detailed Site 
Plan. The Site Plan approval process is provided for this purpose. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.150.010, 1995) 


16.76.020 - Application requirements. 
    Applications for Site Plan Approval and subdivision map shall be submitted for all multi-family 
development, condominium conversion, clustered Agriculture-Ranch (R-A) and Rural Residential (R-R) 
development, mixed use projects and non-residential projects involving the construction of new buildings. 
(Ord. 194 §3 (part), 2007: Ord. 68 § 9.150.020, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 285, § 8, 6-9-2015;Ord. No. 298, § 6, 6-14-2016) 


16.76.030 - Required Site Plan contents. 
    Each Site Plan shall set forth in text, maps, and diagrams the following, unless determined by the 
Director of Community Development to be unnecessary for a particular project. The Director may also 
require at his or her discretion the submission of additional information as needed for a particular project: 
A. ?An existing setting description which includes: 
1. ?A description of the physical characteristics of the site, 
2. ?Available public services and facilities, 
3. ?The capacity of the existing circulation system, and 
4. ?The existing and planned land use of adjacent properties; 
B. ?A discussion of specific objectives and limits for development of the property which recognize 
and respond to identified constraints; 
C. ?The level of public services and facilities required to serve the proposed development; 
D. ?Proposed access and circulation, including parking areas, loading areas, and pedestrian 
walkways. The Site Plan shall also detail any improvements to adjacent or off-site roadways 
required to serve the proposed development;

setting forth its decision. The decision shall become effective thirty (30) days after the adoption of the 
resolution, unless an appeal has been filed. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.150.050, 1995) 


16.76.060 - Basis for approval or denial of a Site Plan. 
    The Commission, and Council on appeal, in acting to approve a Site Plan application, may impose 
conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure the project is consistent with the General Plan, 
compatible with surrounding land use, and meets the provisions and intent of this Development Code. In 
making such a determination, the hearing body shall find that the proposed use is in general in accord 
with the following principles and standards: 
A. ?That the proposed uses are consistent with the General Plan; 
B. ?That the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings, and structures have 
been considered, and that the use will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to these 
adjacent uses, buildings, or structures; 
C. ?That the site for the proposed use is of adequate size and shape to accommodate the use and 
buildings proposed; 
D. ?That the proposed use complies with all applicable development standards of the zoning 
district; and 
E. ?That the proposed use observes the spirit and intent of this Development Code. 
F. ?That the clustering site plan results in a substantial reduction in the following impacts than 
would have occurred had the property developed pursuant to development standards in Exhibit 
"A" Table 20-1(A): 
a. ?Grading; 
b. ?Roadways and driveway intrusions into sensitive habitat areas, open space, and the Chino 
Hills State Park; 
c. ?Impacts to environmental and visual resources. 
G. ?That the clustering site plan protects more open space than would have been required by 
Section 16.08.070. 
(Ord. 68 § 9.150.060, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 298, § 5, 6-14-2016) 


16.76.070 - Time limits. 
A. ?Use of Approved Site Plan. Any Site Plan which is not used within the time specified in the grant of 
approval or, if no time is specified, within two years of the effective date of such approval, expires at 
the end of that period. The Planning Commission may extend such approval for a period of time not 
to exceed two years, provided an application requesting the extension is filed prior to the original 
extension date. For purposes of this section "used" means the commencement of construction 
activity or any activity authorized by the grant. 
B. ?[Expiration; Appeal.] Any applicant disputing the expiration of any Site Plan under this section must 
appeal within ten (10) working days of the expiration date. The appeal must follow the process set 
forth in Section 16.58.060 of this Code. The appeal must be made to the Planning Commission for 
permits approved by the Planning Commission, and to the City Council for permits approved by the 
City Council. 
C. ?[Approval.] The approval of any Site Plan approval approved concurrently (as part of the same 
project) with a Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map shall be tied to the approval of the 
Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map as set forth in Subsection 16.58.050(G). 
(Ord. 68 § 9.150.070, 1995) 
(Ord. No. 252, § 3(f), (g), 1-24-2012; Ord. No. 261, § 3(h), 1-8-2013) 


16.76.080 - Site plan approval attached to the property. 
    An approved Site Plan which is valid and in effect pursuant to the provisions of this Development 
Code shall run with the land and shall continue to be valid upon change of ownership of the land or any 
lawfully existing building or structure on the land. Notwithstanding the above, for Site Plans approved for 
clustered single-family structures, once the original structure is constructed pursuant to the Site Plan, 
subsequent changes to the footprint, elevations, and materials and colors of single-family structures may 
proceed without seeking an amendment to the Site Plan as long as the footprint of such structures stays 
within the required setbacks set forth in the Site Plan, and the subsequent improvements are in 
compliance with all other applicable provisions set forth in Title 15 and 16 of this Code.

Chapter 16.78 - SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMITS 
Sections: 


16.78.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of a site development permit is to provide for administrative review and approval of 
detailed plans for a proposed use. Uses which require a site development permit are regarded as having 
a relatively low potential for adverse impacts on the subject site or surrounding community due to the 
nature or magnitude of the use. A site development permit may be granted at the discretion at the 
Director of Community Development or his or her designee and is not the automatic right of any applicant. 
(Ord. 94 § 2 (part), 1997) 


16.78.020 - Applications. 
    Each applicant for a site development permit shall submit the following to the Planning Division: 
A. ?A completed application on a form prescribed by the Director of Community Development 
(Director) or his or her designee; and 
B. ?The name and address of the applicant with evidence that he or she is the owner of the parcel 
involved or that he or she has the permission of the owner to make such application; and 
C. ?A legal description of the subject parcel or premises if requested by the Director; and 
D. ?Copies of plot plans in the number specified by the Planning Division; and 
E. ?An application fee equal to the amount charged for filing a Site Plan application in accordance 
with Section 16.58.030 of the Chino Hills Development Code and as established by resolution of 
the City Council; and 
F. ?A written statement explaining that the requested use will not cause negative impacts; endanger 
or otherwise imperil the public health, safety, or general welfare; and will not be materially 
detrimental to the property of other persons located in the vicinity of the proposed use; and 
G. ?Any other information as may be required by the Community Development Department. 
(Ord. 94 § 2 (part), 1997) 


16.78.030 - Processing. 
    Site development permits shall be acted upon administratively by the Director or designee. A public 
hearing shall not be required. 
A. ?Review of Application. An application shall be filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 
16.58.020 of this Development Code. Upon acceptance of a site development permit application 
as complete, the Director of Community Development or his or her designee shall review the 
proposed plans under all applicable regulations and guidelines set forth in the Chino Hills 
Development Code. The Director of Community Development or his or her designee shall not 
authorize or approve a site development permit for a land use that is less restrictive than the 
mandatory requirements set forth in the Development Code. Discretionary guidelines expressed 
therein may be used by the Director or his or her designee to determine the approval, denial, or 
conditional approval of the permit. Establishment, maintenance, and operation of the use or 
uses proposed by the application shall be in compliance at all times with the information and 
specifications shown on the approved site development permit, regulations set forth in the 
Chino Hills Development Code, and all other laws of the City of Chino Hills, the State of 
California, and the United States of America. 
B. ?Determination. The Director or designee shall have the authority to approve, conditionally 
approve, or deny the application for a site development permit in accordance with the provisions 
of this chapter and subject to the requirements of the Chino Hills Development Code. As a 
condition of approval, the Director or designee may impose additional requirements as deemed 
reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with this Development Code; the General 
Plan; and the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
C. ?Referral. The Director or designee may, at his or her discretion, refer the site development 
permit to the Planning Commission for review and approval. In this case, the Planning

16.78.040 - Findings. 
    The following findings shall be made prior to the approval of any site development permit: 
A. ?That the requested site development permit will not adversely affect the purpose and intent of 
this chapter, and the proposed use is consistent with the General Plan; and 
B. ?That the proposed use, activity, and/or improvement(s) are consistent with the provisions of the 
Development Code for the City; and 
C. ?That the proposed use will not have significant adverse effects on adjoining land uses and other 
permitted uses of the area in which it is proposed to be located; and 
D. ?That the approval of the permit application is in compliance with the requirements of the 
California Environmental Quality Act; and 
E. ?That the application will not result in conditions or circumstances contrary to the public health, 
safety, and general welfare of the City. 
(Ord. 94 § 2 (part), 1997) 


16.78.050 - Authorization. 
A. ?A site development permit provides authorization for a precise plan of development. Any substantial 
change from the original Site Plan and/or design plans shall be submitted to the Planning Division 
under reapplication for a site development permit. No modification to the Site Plan and/or design 
plans or the conditions of the approval for a site development permit shall be permitted without the 
approval of the Director of Community Development or his or her designee. 
B. ?The applicant shall comply with any restriction or condition required by the Director of Community 
Development or his or her designee, or by the Planning Commission on appeal, in the granting of a 
site development permit. If such conditions are not met, the Planning Commission may hold a public 
hearing in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.36.070 of the Chino Hills Development Code to 
determine if the site development permit should be revoked or modified. Upon the revocation of a 
site development permit, the further use of the property or structure on such property by authority of 
such permit shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
C. ?All acts of the Director of Community Development or his or her designee shall be construed as 
administrative acts performed for the purpose of assuring that the intent and purpose of this chapter 
shall apply in individual cases, and shall not be construed as amendments to the provisions of this 
chapter, the Development Code, or to the official Zoning Map. 
(Ord. 94 § 2 (part), 1997) 


16.78.060 - Time limits. 
A. ?Use of Site Development Permit. Any site development permit which is not used within the time 
specified in the grant of approval or, if no time is specified, within one year of the effective date of 
such approval, expires at the end of that period. The Community Development Director or his or her 
designee may extend such approval for a period of time not to exceed one year, provided an 
application requesting the extension is filed prior to the original extension date. For purposes of this 
section "used" means the commencement of construction activity or any activity authorized by the 
grant. 
B. ?[Expiration; Appeal.] Any applicant disputing the expiration of any site development permit under this 
section must appeal within ten (10) working days of the expiration date. The appeal must follow the 
process set forth in Section 16.78.080 of this Code.

    Any decision by the Director of Community Development or his or her designee may be appealed to 
the Chino Hills Planning Commission in accordance with Section 16.58.060 of the Chino Hills 
Development Code. 
(Ord. 94 § 2 (part), 1997) 


16.78.090 - Reservation of right to review site development permitChanged circumstances. 
    Any site development permit granted or approved under this chapter shall be granted or approved 
with the City and its Planning Commission and City Council retaining and reserving the right and 
jurisdiction to review and modify the permitincluding the conditions of approvalbased on changed 
circumstances. Changed circumstances include, but are not limited to, the modification of the business, a 
change in scope, emphasis, size, or nature of the business, or the expansion, alteration, reconfiguration, 
or change of use. The reservation of right to review any permit granted or approved under this chapter by 
the City, its Planning Commission, and City Council is in addition to, and not in-lieu-of, the right of the 
City, its Planning Commission, and City Council to review and revoke or modify any permit granted or 
approved under this chapter for any violations of the conditions imposed on such permit.

1. ?Alterations to a nonconforming structure are permissible, provided such alterations do not 
intensify any existing nonconformities nor create additional nonconformities. Alterations shall

such reconstruction does not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the appraised value of such 
structure at the time such damage occurred. 
2. ?If, in the process of reconstructing a nonconforming structure pursuant to this subsection, 
certain nonconformities can be brought into conformance, they shall be brought into 
conformance.

Chapter 16.86 - DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PARK AND RECREATION PURPOSES 
Sections: 


16.86.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the California 
Government Code which authorizes a City to require the dedication of land for park and recreation 
facilities or payment of in-lieu fees incident to and as a condition of approval of a Tentative Map or 
Tentative Parcel Map for certain subdivisions. 
(Ord. 66 § 1, 1995) 


16.86.020 - Park land dedication requirements. 
A. ?Applicability. The dedication of land for park and recreation facilities shall be required incident to and 
as a condition of the approval of a Tentative Map or Tentative Parcel Map for a subdivision, except 
subdivisions for which Tentative Maps or Tentative Parcel Maps have been filed prior to thirty (30) 
days after the effective date of this chapter. Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not 
used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, 
however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit 
is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels 
within four years, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition 
to the issuance of such permit. Subdivisions within the Los Serranos area as shown on Exhibit 1 to 
the Park Study Report dated May 11, 1995, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter. 
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivision or to condominium 
projects or stock cooperatives which consist of division of airspace in an existing multifamily 
residential building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
B. ?Use of Land and Fees. The land, fees or combination of land and fees, are to be used only for the 
purpose of providing park or recreational facilities within the City which will serve or benefit future 
inhabitants of such subdivision, and the park and recreational facilities so developed shall bear a 
reasonable relationship to the needs therefor by the inhabitants of the subdivision. The park and 
recreational facilities shall be consistent with the standards and policies for park and recreation 
facilities, adopted in the General Plan, the Park, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan or an 
applicable specific plan. 
C. ?Establishment and Development Time. The City Council shall specify by resolution at the time 
approval is given to the final map when the development of a park or recreation facility to serve the 
subject subdivision will begin. The starting date shall be reasonable with respect to (1) the need for 
such park or facility, (2) weather constraints, (3) minimized disruption of the neighborhood, and (4) 
the accumulation of the necessary funds and land. 
D. ?Land Disposition. In the event that opportunities for better recreation facilities than those provided by 
the dedication materialize, the land so dedicated may be sold with the proceeds therefrom being 
used for suitable park and recreation facilities which serve the neighborhood in which that 
subdivision is located. 
E. ?Standards for Dedications. The amount of land required to be dedicated to the City for park and 
recreation facilities incident to and as a condition of the approval of a Tentative Map or Tentative 
Parcel Map for a subdivision shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use or benefits of the park 
and recreation facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. It is found and determined that 
the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that three acres of usable land for 
each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within the City be devoted to neighborhood or 
community park and recreation facilities. 
F. ?Amount of Land to be Dedicated. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the number of acres 
or fraction of an acre of usable land required to be dedicated to the City for park and recreation 
facilities incident to and as a condition of the approval of a Tentative Map or Tentative Parcel Map 
shall be the product of the following: 
1. ?The number of proposed dwelling units within the subdivision; multiplied by 
2. ?The average number of residents per dwelling unit within the incorporated territory of the City, 
as determined by the most recent federal census or a census taken pursuant to the provisions 
of Title 4, Division 3, Part 2 of the California Government Code (commencing with Section 
40200), or such other acceptable means of determination provided by California Government

16.86.030 - Payment of in-lieu fees for park and recreation purposes. 
A. ?Amount of In-Lieu Fees Required. Where a fee is required to be paid in-lieu-of dedicating land, the 
fee shall be based on the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required 
for dedication, as provided in Section 16.86.020(F). Such fee shall be determined each year in the 
amount as set forth in a park fee study. The fair market value of a buildable acre shall be based on 
the most recent appraisal of similarly situated property for usable park land within the City as 
determined by the City Manager in consultation with the Parks and Landscape Director. If the 
subdivider objects to such evaluation, the subdivider may, at its own expense, obtain an appraisal of 
the property by a qualified real estate appraiser approved by the City Manager, which appraisal may 
be accepted by the City Council if found reasonable or the City and subdivider may agree to the fair 
market value. 
B. ?Fifty Parcels or Less. The payment of fees in-lieu-of dedication may be required only in subdivisions 
containing fifty (50) or less lots or parcels, except that when a condominium project, stock 
cooperative or community apartment project exceeds fifty (50) dwelling units, dedication of land may 
be required notwithstanding that the number of parcels may be less than fifty-one (51). 
(Ord. 66 § 3, 1995) 


16.86.040 - Combination of land and fees required. 
    When only a portion of the required land is dedicated as required by Section 16.86.020, an in-lieu 
fee for the remaining required acres of land shall be paid in accordance with Section 16.86.030. 
(Ord. 66 § 4, 1995) 


16.86.050 - Procedure. 
    The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be 
as follows: 
A. ?Action by Subdivider. At the time of filing a Tentative Map or Tentative Parcel Map for approval, 
the subdivider shall, as part of such filing state in writing whether such subdivider desires to 
dedicate property for park and recreation purposes or to pay a fee in-lieu thereof. If the 
subdivider desires to dedicate land for this purpose, the area shall be designated on the 
tentative tract or parcel map as submitted. 
B. ?Actions of City. At the time of the Tentative Map or Tentative Parcel Map approval, the Parks 
and Recreation Commission (the "Advisory Agency") shall recommend to the legislative body 
taking action on the subdivision whether to require dedication of the land within the subdivision, 
payment of a fee in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, and such legislative body shall 
incorporate such recommendation as a part of its approval of the Tentative Map or Tentative 
Parcel Map. 
C. ?Prerequisites for Approval of Final Map. Where dedication is offered and accepted, it shall be 
accomplished in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act. Where fees are required, such fees 
shall be deposited with the City prior to the approval of the final tract map. Open space 
covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to the 
approval of the final tract map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final tract 
map. 
D. ?Determination. The Advisory Agency shall recommend whether to require land dedication, 
require payment of a fee in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, by consideration of the 
following: 
1. ?Recreational element of the City's General Plan and the City's Park, Recreation and Open 
Space Master Plan; and 
2. ?Topography, geology, access and location of land within the subdivision available for 
dedication; and 
3. ?Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication. 
(Ord. 66 § 5, 1995) 


16.86.060 - Credit for private open space. 
    When private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision 
and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by future residents of the subdivision, such 
areas shall be credited up to twenty-five (25) percent against the requirement of a dedication of park and 
recreation purposes set forth in Section 16.86.020 or the payment of fees set forth in Section 16.86.030, 
provided the Advisory Agency finds that it is in the public interest to do so, and that the following 
standards are met: 
A. ?That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the 
zoning, land use district, and building regulations shall not be included in the computation of 
such private open space; and 
B. ?That the private ownership and maintenance of the private open space is adequately provided 
for by written agreement; and 
C. ?That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by 
recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of the property within 
the tract; and 
D. ?That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation 
purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access 
and location of the private open space land; and 
E. ?That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of 
the City's General Plan and Park Master Plan and are approved by the Parks and Recreation 
Commission; and 
F. ?That the private recreational facilities include one or more of the following active recreational 
elements: (1) Open spaces dedicated to the active recreational pursuits such as soccer, golf, 
baseball, softball and football; (2) basketball courts, tennis courts, badminton courts, 
shuffleboard courts or other similar hard-surfaced areas and volleyball courts, especially

ordinances adopting the financial plan or the Development Code, or with those ordinances as amended 
and superseded, the provisions of this chapter shall apply. 
(Ord. 66 § 7, 1995) 


16.86.080 - Effect on other ordinances. 
    Except as set out in Section 17.86.070, this chapter does not supersede or replace any existing

shall not be construed to limit the powers of the City Council to utilize any other method for accomplishing 
this purpose but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the City Council is authorized to 
impose as a condition to approving new development pursuant to state and local statutory and decisional 
law.

sole discretion of the City. 
4. ?Radius/Turn Around. There shall be a forty (40) foot radius turn-around area to ensure 
unrestricted access to and from the gate area and public street system. This requirement shall 
be treated as a general standard which may be decreased or increased based upon site and 
public health or safety considerations at the sole discretion of the City. 
5. ?Fire District Review. The Chino Valley independent fire district shall be asked to make its review 
and recommendations on any proposed plan. The gating plan shall conform with the fire 
district's development standards and be consistent with the fire district's fire protection 
standards for access into gated communities. Any modifications to the gating system shall be 
approved by the fire district. A negative recommendation from the fire district shall result in a 
termination of the application. 
6. ?Vehicle Code Enforcement. The Vehicle Code shall not be enforced on any private streets, 
unless specifically requested to by a sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent majority of the 
property owners in accordance with state law and approved by the City Council. 
7. ?Other Topographical Considerations. The City Engineer shall review the plan for other site and 
topographical layout considerations to ensure that the design of the gate system does not 
create health or safety hazards. 
8. ?Public Facilities. The proposal shall not block or inhibit access by the public to public, or quasi-
public facilities such as parks, schools, hiking, biking, and equestrian trails, etc. The plan shall 
clearly indicate how these public facilities will be accessible to the general community. 
D. ?Utility Coordination. The plan shall show the layout of adjacent utility facilities. Any utilities which are 
in conflict with the proposed gate system, or need to be relocated to provide accessibility as 
determined by the utility companies, shall be relocated at the applicant's expense. The plan shall 
also indicate that all utilities are provided access to the neighborhood to perform their functions. 
E. ?Financial Plan. The applicant shall submit a financial plan establishing the gate-guarded community 
and which demonstrates that the streets, gates, and related areas will be adequately maintained on 
a permanent basis. The financial plan shall be peer-reviewed by a consultant chosen and approved 
by the City. Notwithstanding any other section of this Code, in no case shall the City be considered a 
guarantor, warrantor, or have any obligation whatsoever to perform or pay for any maintenance, 
repair, replacement, or any other cost related to the gates or the private streets of a gate-guarded 
community established under this chapter. 
F. ?Contract Services. The applicant shall contact all contract services to provide access to the gated 
community to allow for continued service. Any modifications, new construction, or other features 
required to maintain service shall be completed at the applicant's own and sole cost and expense.

the City Council finds and determines that the public street(s) in question is/are no longer 
necessary for present or prospective public use. 
3. ?In determining whether to vacate a public street as a part of a gate-guarded neighborhood plan, 
the City Council will take into consideration the health, safety, aesthetic, social, and economic 
impacts arising from the proposed vacation of public street(s) as part of the specific application 
under review. 
4. ?The proposal will not inhibit circulation within City, block access roads necessary for emergency 
vehicles, or result in substandard streets or conditions outside of the gate-guarded

negative declaration, environmental impact report and mitigation monitoring plan, the conditions 
of the development approval, or the Administrative Policy adopted by the City Council. 
    The replacement ratio may be expanded or reduced as determined by the Director if the reduced 
ratio is consistent with any mitigation measure in a mitigated negative declaration or environmental 
impact report, and the Director makes at least one of the following additional findings: 
1. ?An expanded or reduced replacement ratio is consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
2. ?A reduced replacement ratio is appropriate because the protected tree(s) in question are 
located where the impact of the tree removal on the community is limited. 
3. ?A reduced replacement ratio is appropriate because the property in question has an 
adequate number of existing trees. 
4. ?A reduced replacement ratio is appropriate because a compensating payment is made to 
the City's Protected Tree Replacement Fund. 
D. ?When on-site features, project constraints, and/or other considerations exist which prevent 
reasonable on-site relocation, relocation to an approved off-site location may be permitted. Off-
site location of mitigation trees must be in City-accessible areas via public easements or City 
ownership. Off-site locations are may not be private property. 
E. ?A plan acceptable to the Director to ensure that the topography of the land and the effect of the 
tree removal will not cause soil erosion or increase flows of surface waters. 
F. ?A maintenance plan that includes maintenance measures for each replaced and/or relocated 
tree for a minimum period of five (5) years. The owner shall record a maintenance covenant, 
pursuant to Chapter 16.84 or any other applicable law, approved as to form by the City, against 
the property to that subsequent property owners are bound by this condition. It is the property 
owner's responsibility to request the removal of any such covenant from record once the 
maintenance period ends, and the City shall not unreasonably withhold consent for such 
removal. If during the required maintenance period the tree(s) is (are) declared unhealthy by a 
certified arborist, the diseased trees shall be removed and replaced at the cost of the owner. 
The size of the replacement trees shall be determined by the Director. A performance 
guarantee may also be required in accordance with Section 16.90.110. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.080 - Tree pruning. 
    All pruning of protected trees shall follow proper arboriculture practices as outlined within the 
International Society of Arboriculture Pruning Standards. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.090 - Expiration and extension. 
    The tree permit shall be exercised within one year of the issuance of the grading permit. Time 
extensions, for up to a total of two (2) additional years, may be granted by the Director. If a tree permit is 
not exercised within the established time frame, and a time extension is not granted, the tree permit will 
expire and will no longer be valid for the removal or relocation of a protected tree(s). 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.100 - Revocation. 
    A tree permit may be revoked or modified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 16.58.080 
of this Code if any of the following findings are made: 
A. ?The original findings cannot be supported. 
B. ?The original findings resulted from misrepresentation or fraud. 
C. ?The requirements of the tree permit have not been implemented in a timely manner. 
D. ?The tree permit holder's activities are in violation of any code, law, ordinance or statute. 
E. ?The tree permit holder's activities are detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare or 
constitute a nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.110 - Performance guarantee. 
    A tree permit applicant may be required to provide adequate performance security for the faithful 
performance of conditions of approval imposed as part of the tree permit. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.120 - Appeals. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, any appeal of actions and decisions of the Director 
authorized by this chapter shall be filed in writing with the City Clerk within ten (10) working days after the 
action or decision. The appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal, shall specify the factual basis for 
the appeal and shall be signed by the applicant. The appeal shall be heard by the City Manager, or by his 
or her designee, as the hearing officer. Notice of the hearing shall be sent by certified or registered mail to 
the appellant (unless such mail is refused or unclaimed, then the City shall subsequently send the mail 
via first class postage prepaid mail and such mailing shall be deemed actual service.) Within ten (10) 
days after the hearing, the hearing officer shall give written notice of the decision to the appellant. The 
decision of the hearing officer shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.130 - Emergency removals. 
    Notwithstanding the requirements of this chapter, in the case of an emergency caused by a 
protected tree being in a hazardous or dangerous condition posing an immediate threat to person or 
property, the Director, his or her designee, or any member of the Police Department or Fire Department 
(as that term is defined in Title 8 of this Code) may authorize removal of such a tree. 
(Ord. No. 259, § 3, 9-11-2012) 


16.90.140 - Penalties. 
A. ?Violation of any provision of this chapter may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor in accordance with 
Chapter 1.36. 
B. ?Any violation of this chapter that is committed during the construction or development of a project is 
grounds for suspension or revocation of any other permits required for the project by this 
Development Code. 
C. ?In addition to any other penalties provided by law, violations of this chapter may be subject to 
administrative citation in accordance with Chapter 1.18. 
D. ?In addition to any other penalties provided by law, violations of this chapter may be abated as a 
public nuisance and the City's costs of abatement recovered in accordance with Chapter 1.36. 
E. ?Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no development permit of any kind, including but not 
limited to, any grading permit, building permit or certificate of occupancy, shall be issued for any lot 
on which one or more protected trees have been removed or relocated in violation of the provisions 
of this chapter, unless and until the owner of such lot has been issued a tree permit in accordance 
with this [chapter].

CHINO HILLS DEVELOPMENT CODE 


APPENDIX B 
VILLAGE STRUCTURE AND IDENTITY 
Introduction 
The character of Chino Hills at large is a function of its topographic features, interconnecting natural open 
spaces and the landscaping treatment in medians of primary and major highways. These elements also 
become the determinants for area boundaries (shown in Figure Appendix B-1). Often, prominent ridge 
lines perform this function, such as between the Carbon Canyon and Soquel Canyon areas. In some 
cases, major highways, such as Peyton Drive, form boundaries, as between Los Ranchos, The Oaks, 
and Woodview. And, occasionally, property ownership lines influence the exact boundary alignment as in 
the case of Carbon Canyon and Los Ranchos areas. 
Beyond the identity provided by topography, the character of an area is established through entry 
statements, existing tree stands, drainage ways and landscaping within the commercial areas, and within 
parkways along primary and major highways and streets and pathways leading to the commercial 
centers. 
This Appendix identifies the character of the landscaping and related design treatments which should be 
used in the eight areas shown in Figure Appendix B-1. The intent of these guidelines is to provide 
direction in establishing or reinforcing the identity of various areas of the City. Landowners and 
developers are encouraged to design alternative landscape treatments which equally or better achieve 
the desired intent. 
Mandatory Standards for All Areas 
The following standards apply citywide, including in the eight areas mapped in Figure Appendix B-1. 
1) ?Disturbed areas between natural open space and developed lands shall be established with 
native materials in a natural setting consistent with fire safety and erosion standards. 
2) ?Enhancement of natural drainage courses/riparian habitat so that they are incorporated into 
active open space areas of the village and improved with facilities such as additional 
landscaping and pedestrian and bicycle pathways. 
3) ?Replacement of existing native type vegetation where original vegetation was eliminated by 
major public facilities such as roads. 
4) ?Parking areas should be screened from view through the use of berms, fencing and 
landscaping. 
5) ?Preservation of protected trees as defined in Section 16.90.020.G. 
Rolling Ridge Estates 
This area is located in the extreme northern portion of the City, along the west side of the Chino Valley 
Freeway (Highway 71), just south of the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60). It is characterized by rolling 
Hills and valleys that become very steep and rugged in the western half, where there are also some very 
significant strands of native oak trees. 
Because of its proximity to two major highways, this area has a high degree of visibility. This suggests 
some very intensive commercial and residential land sues along the Highway 71 corridor and also special 
care in preserving some natural features, such as knolls and ridge lines, to retain some degree of rural 
character and continuity with other villages. 
This area has two land use focal points. One is the regional shopping center planned on about 90 acres 
along Highway 71. It is surrounded by supporting commercial and high density (15 to 24 dwelling units 
per acre) residential uses. A commercial center is also provided more in the center of the area. It is 
intended to be the focus of activities for residents of the area and will contain convenience commercial 
and public uses. 
Landscape treatment for this area should include formal tree plantings and color in development areas 
within the urban area. Transportation corridors should feature a formal arrangement of median tree 
plantings. Parkways and areas between developments should be formal in nature, including screening to 
separate different uses and various housing projects. 
The following guidelines have been prepared to provide direction in establishing a design identity for this 
area: 
1) ?Tree stands in parkways and medians should be under planted with turf or Carissa grandiflora 
or Gazania hybrids. 
2) ?Screening to separate land uses should consist of large shrubs such as: Escallonia fradesi, 
Abelia grandiflora, Grevillea lanigera, Pittosporum tobira, and Xylosma congestum. 
3) ?Differing intensities of development should be provided with identity through the use of color 
treatment peculiar to each area of intensity. Suggested tree species include: Albizia julibrissin 
(Silk Tree), Bauhinia variegate (Purple Orchid Tree), Chorisia speciosa (Floss Silk Tree), 
Jacaranda acutifolia, Lagerstromeia indica (Crape Myrtle), Pyrus kawakamii (Evergreen Pear), 
and Tipuana tipu. 
4) ?Fencing is suggested to consist of brick pilasters five (5) feet in height, ten (10) feet on center 
with wrought iron or wood panels. 
5) ?The regional shopping center should be landscaped in a manner compatible with, and 
supportive of, the overall landscaping guidelines for adjacent areas of Rolling Ridge. 
Landscaping shall serve in lieu of fencing or barrier walls and should not conflict with 
appropriate view corridors to the regional center. 
Tres Hermanos 
This area is located in the northwestern portion of the City. It encompasses the upper Tonner Canyon 
area, a long, well-defined canyon with a broad grassland valley bottom. The valley contains a narrow 
drainage course, featuring several small, manmade reservoirs. 
The landscape treatment will capitalize on the view potential by creating view windows along major roads. 
Because the valley is relatively shallow, fencing should feature some bermed walls in earthen tones, 
banked with low grass forms. Lighting will be fairly strong along the major highways. 
The following guidelines have been prepared to aid in establishing a design identity for this area: 
1) ?The village core and adjacent high density development should be linked by safe, convenient 
and attractive pedestrian paths. Landscaping should feature materials used in the commercial 
center, and provide winter sun and summer shade. They should also be tastefully lighted to 
encourage evening use. Suggested tree types are Platanus racemosa and Populus fremontii. 
2) ?Grand Avenue and Tonner Canyon Road should have center medians landscaped to provide 
area identity and community wide continuity. Suggested tree types are Platanus racemosa for 
Grand Avenue and Tristania conferta for Tonner Canyon Road. 
3) ?Fencing is suggested to consist of a mixture of undulating berms and walls of slump stone or 
other appropriate materials. Berms should be planted in low grasses or ground covers. 
Baccharis pilularis or Gazania hybrids are suggested. 
4) ?Buffers adjacent to developments are suggested to consist of massing of broad tree types, 
include Schinus molle and Acacia baileyana. Underplanting of Acacia longifolia, Dodonea 
viscosa and Rhus species are suggested for screening. 
Los Ranchos 
This area is located in the mid-northern portion of the City. It is composed of rolling Hills and valleys 
generally devoid of any visually significant vegetation. English Creek and a tributary stream of Little Chino 
Creek add a riparian feature to two of the largest valleys. 
Much of the character of the area is derived from the large horse ranches located along English Road in 
the east central part of the area. The Country-western orientation inspired by these ranches will become 
the theme of the entire area. It appears in the architecture of "Ralphs" commercial center in the Gordon 
Ranch planned development, and is intended to be used in theme structures, fencing, equestrian paths 
and landscaping. 
The following guidelines are provided to assist in establishing a design identity for this area: 
1) ?Parkway landscaping should consist of a non-uniform arrangement of planting masses, 
including trees, shrubs and ground covers. Wherever possible, the streetscape edges should be 
left in their natural state. Recommended parkway trees are Cinnamon camphora, Eucalyptus 
polyanthemos, Gingko biloba, Gleditsia tricanthos inermis, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron 
tulipifera, Pinus eldarica and Platanus acerifolia. Suggested shrubs are Baccharis pilularis, 
Hypericum calycinum, Lonicera japonica and Rosmarinus officinalis. 
2) ?Natural drainage courses should be preserved and integrated into the local open space system. 
Landscaping should include seasonally water-oriented plants to stabilize and enhance the 
natural riparian streambeds. Suggested trees are Platanus racemosa and Populus fremontii. 
3) ?Fencing should be of a design, material and color that complements the area character. The 
primary materials should be stone and wood. An example is an open split rail fence, five (5) feet 
in height, 4 × 4 inch posts, eight (8) feet on center, strapped top and bottom by 2 × 8 inch top 
and bottom rails with diagonal straps of I × 6 inch boards. The use of stone pilasters is also 
suggested. 
Woodview 
This area is located in the mideastern portion of Chino Hills, generally along the west side of State 
Highway 71. Because of its accessibility and relatively level topography, most of the area has already 
developed. Included in this area are the communities of Los Serranos and Glenmeade, and the open 
spaces within Boys Republic, the Los Serranos Golf Course, and the Lake Los Serranos Club 
mobilehome community. 
Woodview has a very definite suburban character stemming from the single-family detached housing 
which predominates. Some visual relief is provided by the large open space uses noted above and, of 
equal importance, several much smaller landscape features. They include the median strip in Glenmeade 
Boulevard, the parkways along the south side of Carbon Canyon Road and west side of Pipeline Avenue, 
several natural drainage courses and the strong Eucalyptus windrows mostly in the southern end of the 
area. These features should be preserved, enhanced and reinforced. 
The primary landscape treatment in Woodview is the continued use of the Eucalyptus windrow. The trees 
should be planted along the drainage ways, major streets, entries and village core areas to strengthen the 
area identity. 
The following guidelines have been prepared to provide assistance in landscaping design in this area: 
1) ?Eucalyptus windrows should be continued or introduced along drainage ways, medians and 
parkways. Eucalyptus camaldulinsis and Eucalyptus cladocalyx are suggested at staggered 
intervals of twenty feet (20?) on center, ten feet (10?) on center for street medians. Eucalyptus 
sideroxylon is also recommended for color accent. 
2) ?Fencing should be provided in short runs not to exceed forty feet (40?) and five feet six inches 
(5?6?) to six feet (6?) in height. Suggested materials are 6 × 6 inch posts, 8 feet (8?) on center 
with 4 × 6 inch and 1 × 10 inch vertical shiplap. Fencing should face at 45 degree angles at 
intersections and have open slats at drainage corridors. 
3) ?Crosswalks at area entries and in the commercial areas should be textured with contrasting 
materials. 
Carbon Canyon 
The Carbon Canyon area is located in the mid-southwestern portion of the City. It is distinguished by an 
abundance of natural features, including winding, tree-covered streams, prominent ridge lines, steep 
hillside slopes and large stands of native oaks. The setting is highly valued by local residents and 
travelers on Carbon Canyon Road. Carbon Canyon Road, a State Highway, is the only paved road 
through the Hills directly into Orange County and has enabled much of the adjacent lands up and down 
the canyon to develop. The first areas to develop were Sleepy Hollow and the "Canon Lane" subdivision, 
tracts of small lots recorded in the 1920s. Located at the west end of the area next to Orange County, 
they have over the years evolved into small rural neighborhoods. Both are characterized by tiny lots, 
narrow streets and attractive homes. Most notably, however, they complement the natural setting and 
contribute substantially to the rural charm of the area. 
The landscape treatment of the area and the architectural treatment of structures in the core should 
feature natural materials such as river rock and unpainted roughhewn boards to enhance the rustic 
qualities of the area. The following guidelines have been prepared to provide direction in landscaping in 
the Carbon Canyon area: 
1) ?Landscaping should utilize native plant materials as much as possible. Recommended species 
include Platanus racemosa (Western Sycamore), Quercus species (Coast live oak and Scrub 
oak), Schinus molle (California [Pepper tree), Heteromeles arbutifolia (Toyon), and Rhus 
species. 
2) ?Introduced plant materials considered consistent with the rural character of the area include 
Acacia baileyana, Atriplex semi-baccata (Saltbush), Ceanothus griseus horizontalis (Wild lilac), 
Gazania hybrids, and Prunas lyonii (Catalina cherry). 
3) ?Landscaping should be limited to areas that have been disturbed, or for screening. Screening of 
development from Carbon Canyon Road is especially important. 
4) ?Fencing should have a rural appearance. Natural peeler poles with grapestake inserts is 
suggested where closed fencing is required. Open fencing of split-lot rail and/or barbed wire is 
suggested. 
The Oaks 
The Oaks, smallest of the areas, is located in the center of the City. Its character is defined primarily by 
natural features: an exceptionally prominent ridgeline forming the west boundary, a small grassland valley 
abutting the easterly edge, and many beautiful stands of oak trees in the numerous steep canyons. Lands 
immediately north, east and west are generally of a lower elevation. As a result, much of the area enjoys 
panoramic view of the surrounding area. 
The following guidelines have been prepared to aid in landscape design. They are intended to contribute 
to and enhance the character of the Oaks area: 
1) ?Plantings along transportation corridors in the area should consist of tight clustering of trees that 
serve as screening and link the commercial center with adjacent high density residential uses. 
Suggested species include Acacia baileyana, Koelreuteria paniculata, Lagerstroemia indica and 
Ficus ritusa. 
2) ?Skyline treatment should consist of clusters of tree plantings to soften the impact of 
development and to blend with and emulate the natural land form rather than intrude or conflict 
with it. 
3) ?Fencing should be limited and tempered by landscaping as much as possible. Where fencing is 
used, it should be wooden and confined to short runs to serve as a buffer rather than to 
accentuate. It is suggested that fencing consist of 6 × 6 inch posts, 8 feet on center, 5 feet 6 
inches in height with a variety of panels. 
Soquel Canyon 
This area is located in the southern central portion of the City. The land in this area is extremely rugged 
and relatively inaccessible at the present time. There are numerous steep canyons, precipitous ridge lines 
and undisturbed oak and riparian woodland communities. A substantial portion of the area is considered 
to be of high ecological sensitivity because of its value to wildlife. 
The landscape treatment for this area emphasizes the use of native materials in patterns or groupings 
that convey a natural appearance. The only two areas where supplemental planting will likely be required 
are along ridge lines and Soquel Canyon Parkway. Skyline plantings along ridge lines will be important to 
screen roadways and homes from surrounding viewpoints. Intense landscaping and some closed fencing 
along Soquel Canyon Parkway will be essential to screen adjacent development and direct the eye to 
open areas and tree breaks. 
The following guidelines have been prepared to provide assistance in landscape design in the Soquel 
Canyon area: 
1) ?Skyline plantings are suggested to consist of random groupings of Eucalyptus species, 
Melaleuca leucadendra and Tristania conferta, with plantings of shrubs such as Acacia 
longifolia, and Melaleuca nesophila. 
2) ?Screening of development along Soquel Canyon Parkway should consist of mass plantings of 
Acacia baileyana, Melalenca luecadendra and Schinus molle (California Pepper Tree). 
3) ?Some wood fencing may be used along Soquel Canyon Parkway to screen development. 
Suggested materials are rough cedar planking or grapestake. Shrubs noted above shall be 
planted in front of the fence. 
Rincon 
This area is located in the southeastern portion of the City, along State Highway 71. The terrain is 
diverse, varying from the relatively flat highway corridor to the very rugged hills in the central and western 
parts of the area. The most significant areas of ecological sensitivity are within the peninsula that extends 
far to the south. It contains prime predatorial bird habitats. 
The landscape treatment in Rincon Area protects and accentuates views along drainage ways and 
transportation corridors. Plantings are random rather than formal, intensifying with the progression from 
rural areas in the west to urban areas in the east. Landscaping tends to focus views and allow for view 
penetration at drainage ways. Heavy screening along Soquel Canyon Parkway will mitigate the visual 
impacts of development in proximity to the roadway, dropping out at those locations where view potential 
occurs. 
The following guidelines are provided to aid in establishing a design identity for the Rincon area: 
1) ?Fencing should be minimal. Lighting should be sparse and utilitarian along roadways in the rural 
areas. Lighting in the corridor should be more formal and urban in nature. 
2) ?Parkway tree plantings should be linear groupings of vertical tree types to accentuate the view 
windows at such places as drainage ways. Eucalyptus nicholii, Melaluca leucadendra and 
Tristania conferta are suggested. 
3) ?Drainage ways should be maintained in their natural state because of the high visibility from 
Soquel Canyon and Rincon roads. 
4) ?Screening along Soquel Canyon and Rincon Roads should consist of about fifty percent (50%) 
plantings and fifty percent (50%) fencing. Feijoa sellowiana, Tecomaria capensis and Xylosma 
congestum are recommended plant materials. The following fence specifications are suggested: 
Brick pilasters five feet (5?) in height, 16 × 16 inch, ten to twelve feet (10?-12?) on center with 
wrought iron inserts.

(Ord. No. 250, § 1, 1-24-2012) 


APPENDIX C 
Notes For Development Code  
Appendix C "General Citywide Landscape Design Standards" 
The following standards are excerpted from the Chino Hills Specific Plan, which formerly functioned as 
the policy and regulatory planning document for the majority of the area within Chino Hills. 
Because the following pages are an excerpt, the following guidelines should be followed when using the 
information in this Appendix: 
?References to "Villages" should be considered to apply to areas of Chino Hills, as shown in 
Appendix B to this Development Code. 
?The term "village cores" refers to the neighborhood commercial centers located within each of 
the areas shown in Appendix B. 
?Where a standard is provided in the Chino Hills General Plan or elsewhere in this 
Development Code, the standards in those locations shall supersede this Appendix. 
?Where necessary to provide background information, the Chino Hills Specific Plan may be 
consulted as a historical document (policies and regulations in the Chino Hills Specific Plan no 
longer apply). 


CHAPTER 8?LANDSCAPING 


Section CH3.0801 - Intent. 
(a) ?The individuality of and relationship between the villages is strengthened by the landscape plan. 
Overall community identity is greatly enhanced by the continuity of landscape materials along major 
thoroughfares. Conversely, village identity is established through landscaping at major entry points, 
along drainage corridors, within village cores and along collector roads leading to the core. 
(b) ?Guidelines for landscaping and plant selection to create village identity are provided in Chapter 12. 
The purpose of the following standards is to establish community-wide criteria and specifications for 
various landscape treatments which are likely to be common to many or all villages. The categories 
of landscape treatment are: 
(1) ?Grassland: To maintain the natural character of the Chino Hills, some existing grass land areas 
will be preserved and some graded areas will be reestablished as grassland. Reestablished 
grasslands will normally occur as transition zones between development and existing natural 
grassland areas. 
(2) ?Skyline: Skyline planting will be used along ridgelines where development is proposed to soften 
the impact of and draw the eye away from development as a skyline feature. 
(3) ?Ornamental Planting: The purpose of this type of planting within the community is to add 
interest through color and form. It will serve to attract attention to village entry signs and add 
color accent to the street scene. 
(4) ?Slope Planting: This type of landscape is both aesthetic and functional. Aesthetically, it will 
provide a pleasant backdrop along roadways, and it will provide a transition between 
development and adjacent roadways or various other uses. It also helps to improve the physical 
appearance of manufactured slopes by softening the hard edges and unifying the slope with the 
adjacent areas. Functionally, slope planting acts to hold the newly graded soil together, thus 
discouraging erosion. 
(5) ?Roadway Landscape: Roadway treatment includes berming, fencing and landscaping within 
the parkway, the land area lying between the paved road and adjacent private development. It 
also includes median plantings where appropriate. 
(6) ?Fuel Modification: A landscaped and irrigated area between inhabited structures and 
grasslands will frequently be used to reduce the acute fire danger in Chino Hills. Highly 
flammable native brush will be cleared and replaced with mostly low growing groundcover 
possessing a potentially high moisture content. 
(7) ?Solar Shading: Tree shading and vegetation will be used to reduce outdoor air temperatures 
and indoor air-conditioning demand and also make outdoor walking and bicycling more pleasant 
in warm weather. 


Section CH3.0802 - Landscaping Standards. 
(a) ?All residential, commercial, industrial, mixed use and public land uses shall include landscaping. 
These standards shall apply to all landscaped areas with the exception of private residential yards, in 
which case they serve as guidelines. 
(1) ?All landscaping must be done with drought tolerant plants from the attached lists of trees, 
shrubs, vines and groundcovers (Sections CH3.0803 - CH3.0805). 
(A) ?Drought tolerant shall include plants, which when established, require watering no more 
frequently than once every two to three weeks. 
(B) ?Other drought tolerant plants recommended by a registered landscape architect may be 
used if approved by the County Planning Department. 
(C) ?Grasses shall be used in reestablished grasslands between existing natural grasslands 
areas and development. Grasses are also permitted in other locations, especially for 
immediate and temporary erosion control, although high maintenance water demanding 
varieties should generally be limited to recreation areas. 
(D) ?Water demanding plants may be used in areas to be irrigated by an approved reclaimed 
wastewater or greywater system. 
(2) ?An irrigation system shall be required for any landscaped area to insure plantings are 
adequately watered. In commercial, industrial, public, and multiple residential areas where 
backbone water reclamation facilities are planned, the irrigation system shall be separate from 
(not interconnected with) the interior domestic water system. 
(3) ?Prior to issuance of any building permits, landscaping plans shall be approved by the County 
Planning Department for the project. Landscaping plans must address all of the appropriate 
grading and landscaping standards and guidelines contained in the Specific Plan. 
(4) ?Specific planting, staking, watering, and replacement requirements shall be established by the 
responsible service district for any landscaping in public areas including, but not limited to street 
rights-of-way and parks. 
(5) ?Graded slopes shall be promptly revegetated with groundcover or a combination of 
groundcover, shrubs and trees from the approved lists. Hydroseed may partially substitute for 
container plantings. Groundcovers shall possess moderate or high erosion control qualities and 
all plantings shall conform to the applicable village landscape guidelines. Further, appropriate 
fertilization and plant materials shall be verified by soil sampling and analysis by a soils 
laboratory to be indicated on the landscaping plans for the project. 
(6) ?Landscaping requirements for fuel modification zones (fuel breaks for fire safety) are 
established in the Fire Safety Standards of Section CH3.0902. 
(7) ?Landscape treatment at village entries and main or primary entrances into individual 
development projects shall conform to the appropriate village landscape guidelines and plants 
shall be selected from the approved landscaping lists. 
(8) ?Street trees should be long-lived (60 years), deep rooted, and require little maintenance 
(structurally strong, insect and disease resistant, and require little pruning). Tree selection shall 
be from the approved tree list. For medians and parkways where trees will be planted adjacent 
to the curb, recommended trees are asterisked. 
(9) ?Tree sizes and spacing within center medians shall be as follow: 
(A) ?Six-lane major arterials; Trees shall be 24-inch box minimum at 50 feet on center. 
(B) ?Four lane primary highways: Trees shall be grouped at 6 trees per 100 lineal feet with 
groupings at least 100 feet apart. They shall consist of mixed sizes, 5 and 15 gallon and 24 
inch box. 
(10) ?Tree sizes and spacing within parkways shall be as follows: 
(A) ?For parkways along the fronts of residential lots in conventional single family subdivision, 
trees shall be 15 gallon minimum at 30 feet on center. This requirement may be waived 
where average lot size exceeds ½ acre. 
(B) ?For parkways along the rear of residential lots, trees may be grouped or equally spaced 
depending upon the character of the village and the particular development. The number of 
trees shall be not less than indicated by Section CH3.0802(a)(10)(A) and (B). Tree sizes 
shall be mixed 5 and 15 gallon and 24 inch box. 
(C) ?For clustered housing projects consisting of attached or detached dwelling units, tree 
spacing shall be dictated by good design to achieve the desired screening, shading, and 
appearance. The number of trees shall be not less than indicated by Section 
CH3.0802(a)(10)(A) and (B). Tree sizes shall be mixed 5 and 15 gallon and 24 inch box. 
(11) ?In the interest of public safety, trees shall be planted not less than; 25 feet from beginning of 
curb returns at intersections; 10 feet from street lights; 10 feet from fire hydrants; and 10 feet 
from driveways. 
(12) ?Underplantings within medians shall be low profile shrubs, groundcover or grasses. They shall 
conform to the character of the village in which they are located, and be selected from the 
approved landscaping lists. 
(13) ?Parkway underplantings shall consist of low profile groundcover to fences or walls with shrub 
mounding in groupings to soften wall forms. Planting shall be selected from the approved lists of 
shrubs and groundcovers. 
(14) ?Parking lot trees shall have a mature height and spread of at least 30 feet. They should also 
be long-lived (60 years), clean, require little maintenance (structurally strong, insect and disease 
resistant, and require little pruning). Tree selection shall be from the approved tree list. They 
shall be 15 gallon and spaced to shade as shown in Figure 3-41. 
(15) ?Paths and trails which generally parallel the roadway but are not located within or adjacent to 
the paved section shall be landscaped with groundcover on both sides to 10 feet where 
possible. Materials shall be selected from the approved list of groundcovers and conform to the 
applicable village landscape guidelines. Trees picked from the approved tree list, shall also be 
planted to provide summer shade. 
(16) ?Deciduous trees from the approved tree list shall be used in south facing outdoor areas 
around buildings to provide solar access during winter months, while providing shade in hot 
summer months. 
(17) ?Trees and shrubs on west sides of buildings shall be concentrated to reduce heat buildup 
during hot afternoon hours. 
(18) ?Deciduous trees from the approved tree list shall be used where winter sun is to be available 
to outdoor recreation areas, especially areas to north of trees. 
 
SCALE 1? - 60? ? LANDSCAPE SHADING DIAGRAM ? FIGURE 3-41 
Trees planted on North/South axis will cast long shadows East and West during morning and afternoon 
hours in hot summer months. Trees with 35-foot height will caste a shadow approximately 30 feet of the 
East at 3 p.m. on June 21st.

Subdivision Map Act and the County Surveyor's standards as adopted by the Board of 
Supervisors: 
(1) ?It shall be legibly drawn, printed or reproduced by a process guaranteeing a permanent 
record in black on tracing cloth or polyester-base film. Certificates, affidavits and 
acknowledgements may be legibly stamped or printed upon the map with opaque ink. If ink 
is used on a polyester-base film, the ink surface shall be coated with a suitable substance 
to assure permanent legibility. 
(2) ?The size of each sheet shall be eighteen (18) by twenty-six (26) inches. A marginal line 
shall be drawn completely around each sheet, leaving an entirely blank margin of one (1) 
inch. The scale of the map shall be large enough to show all details clearly, and enough 
sheets shall be used to accomplish this end. The particular number of the sheet and the 
total number of sheets comprising the map shall be stated on each of the sheets, and its 
relation to each adjoining sheet shall be clearly shown. 
(3) ?All survey and mathematical information and data necessary to locate all monuments, and 
to locate and retrace any and all interior and exterior boundary lines appearing thereon 
shall be shown, including bearings and distances of straight lines, and radii and area length 
or chord bearings and length of all curves, and such information as may be necessary to

block letters, stating: 
COMPOSITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN NOTE; A Composite Development Plan (C.D.P.) affecting this 
map is on file in the San Bernardino County Office of Building and Safety in C.D.P. Book Page . 
(b) ?Title Sheets. Prior to filing, those certificates and acknowledgements set forth in this Division 
shall appear on the title sheet of the Final Map and may be combined where appropriate. The 
title sheet shall also contain a certificate, signed and acknowledged by all parties having any 
record title interests in real property subdivided, consenting to the preparation and recordation 
of the Final Map, and is required except as provided by the Subdivision Map Act. 
Each sheet of the Final Map shall also contain a title, consisting of the number of the subdivision and 
a subtitle consisting of a description of all property being subdivided by reference to such map or 
maps of the property shown thereon, as shall have been previously recorded or filed with the County 
Clerk pursuant to a final judgement in any action in partition, or shall have been previously filed in the 
Office of the County Recorder, or by reference to the plat of any United States Survey. The title 
sheet shall also show, in a form acceptable to the County Surveyor, such appropriate certificates and 
acknowledgements as required in the Subdivision Map Act, or any additional certificates as required 
by the County Surveyor or County standards. 
(c) ?Certificates on Final Maps. The certificates on Final Maps shall be governed by the provisions 
of the Subdivision Map Act and the Final and Parcel Map standards established by the County 
Surveyor's Office and as adopted and amended by the Board of Supervisors. 
(1) ?Dedications of, or offers to dedicate interests in real property for specified public purposes 
shall be made by a certificate on the title page of the Final Map, signed and acknowledged 
by those parties having any record title interest in the real property being subdivided, 
subject to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. 
In the event that any street shown on a subdivision map is not offered for dedication, the certificate 
may contain a statement to this effect. If such statement appears on the map and if the map is 
approved by the Board of Supervisors, the use of any such street or streets by the public shall be 
permissive only. 
Any offer of dedication of real property for street or public utility easement purposes shall be deemed 
not to include any public utility facilities located on or under such real property unless an intent to 
dedicate such facilities is expressly stated in the certificate, and then only to the extent so stated. 
Any dedication or agreements required within the remainder parcel of a Final Map shall be executed 
by the legal owners of record and any holder in a beneficial interest in a trust deed. 
(2) ?The Final Map shall contain a certificate for execution by the Clerk of the Board, stating that the 
Board of Supervisors approved the map and accepted, subject to improvement, or rejected on 
behalf of the public, any real property offered for dedication or public use in conformity with the 
terms of the offer of dedication. 
(3) ?A certificate is required indicating the engineer or surveyor responsible for the survey and Final 
Map. This certificate shall give the date of the survey, state that the survey and Final Map were 
made by the engineer or surveyor, and indicate that the survey is true and complete as shown. 
The certificate shall also state that all the monuments are of the character and occupy the positions 
indicated, or that they will be set in such positions on or before a specified later date. The certificate 
shall also state that the monuments are, or will be, sufficient to enable the survey to be retraced. 
At least one exterior boundary line of the land being subdivided shall be adequately monumented or 
referenced before the map may be recorded. 
(4) ?The County Surveyor shall issue a certificate, if all of the following requirements have been

required by this section within twenty (20) days from the time the Final Map is submitted to the 
County Surveyor by the subdivider for approval. 
(6) ?At the time the subdivider presents the Final Map, there shall be presented releases executed 
by the various public utilities, including cable television services as to location of their facilities 
and that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the establishment of any easements 
required for such facilities. The failure of any said public utility to notify the County Surveyor of 
the need for such easements within twenty (20) days of receipt of the advance copy of the Final 
Map shall be deemed notice that said provisions and arrangements have been made and no 
further release shall be required. 


83.040220 - Tentative Map. 
The following provisions shall govern the review of Tentative and Vesting Tentative Maps: 
(a) ?Action on Tentative Map. 
(1) ?The Planning Agency shall approve, conditionally approve, extend or disapprove the map 
or maps of the proposed subdivision within fifty (50) days after an application for a 
Tentative Map has been filed, deemed completed and accepted for filing except as 
otherwise provided by the Subdivision Map Act. An official copy of the Planning Agency's 
action shall be filed with the Tentative Map, and be reported directly to the subdivider and 
to the Real Estate Commission of the State of California. If no action is taken upon a 
Tentative Map by the Planning Agency within the time limits specified in this Division, or 
any authorized extension thereof, the Tentative Map as filed shall be deemed to be 
approved insofar as it complies with other applicable requirements of this Division, other 
applicable ordinances of the County of San Bernardino, and all applicable State laws, and 
it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the Board and the Secretary of the Planning Agency to 
certify such approval. This section shall be inapplicable to extensions of time which are 
reasonable and required in order to comply with any provision of State law, including the 
requirements for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970. 
Provided, however, if an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is prepared, the fifty (50) day 
period specified in this section shall not be applicable and the Planning Agency shall take 
action upon the Tentative Map within forty-five (45) days after certification of the EIR. Any 
revised Tentative Map or portion thereof filed with the Planning Agency shall comply with 
the requirements in effect at the time such revised map is considered by the Planning 
Agency. 
(2) ?A Tentative Map shall not be approved in the following cases: 
(A) ?In the case of a conversion of residential real property to a condominium project, 
community apartment project or stock cooperative, the Planning Agency shall not 
approve the Tentative Map unless evidence is provided by the subdivider, as required 
by Section 66452.9 of the California Government Code, that proper notification has 
been given to each of the tenants of the proposed conversion notifying of the 
subdivider's intent to convert. 
(B) ?In the case of a conversion of a stock cooperative or a community apartment project 
to a condominium, the Planning Agency shall not approve a Tentative Map unless 
evidence is provided by the subdivider, as required by Section 66452.10 of the 
California Government Code, that the required number of owners in the cooperative or 
project, as specified in the bylaws or other organizational documents, have voted in 
favor of such conversion. 
(C) ?The Planning Agency shall not approve a Tentative Map, or a Parcel Map for which a 
Tentative Map was not required, if it finds that the land is subject to a contract entered 
into pursuant to the California Land Conservation Act of 1965 (California Government 
Code Section 51296) and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of that land 
would be too small to sustain their agricultural use. For purposes of this section, land 
shall be presumed to be in parcels too small to sustain their agricultural use if the land 
is: (1), less than ten (10) acres in size in the case of prime agricultural land; or, (2), 
less than forty (40) acres in size in the case of land which is not prime agriculture 
land. For purposes of this section agricultural land shall be presumed to be in parcels 
large enough to sustain their agricultural use if the land is (1) at least 10 acres in size 
in the case of prime agricultural land, or (2) at least 40 acres in size in the case of land 
which is not prime agricultural. The Planning Agency may approve a subdivision with 
parcels smaller than those listed above if the findings in Subsections 83.040115 
(c)(8)(B)(i) and (ii), along with the other applicable findings listed in Section 
83.040115, are made or the land within the subdivision is subject to a contract when 
one of the following has occurred: 
(I) ?The Local Agency Formation Commission has approved the annexation of the 
land to a city and the city will not succeed to the contract as provided in California 
Government Code Sections 51243 and 51243.5. 
(II) ?Written notice of nonrenewal of the contract has been served prior to March 7, 
1985, as provided in California Government Code Section 51245. 
(III) ?Written notice of nonrenewal of the contract has been served on or after March 
7, 1985, as provided in California Government Code Section 51245, and, as a 
result of that notice, there are no more than three (3) years remaining in the term 
of the contract. 
(IV) ?The Board has granted tentative approval for cancellation of the contract as 
provided in California Government Code Section 51282. 
(3) ?The approval or conditional approval by the Advisory Agency of any revised or new 
Tentative Map shall annul all previous designs and approvals thereof. 
(4) ?When modifications in design are conditions of approval of a Tentative Map, the 
subdivider shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the submission of Final Maps, submit the 
ten (10) copies of the Tentative Map as modified to the Planning Agency for distribution to 
the Development Review Committee representatives. 
(b) ?Planning Officer Referral. When acting as the Planning Agency for subdivisions where a 
Tentative and Final Map are required, the Planning Officer shall determine, prior to taking an 
action to approve, conditionally approve, extend or deny the application, that the project is 
noncontroversial. For the purpose of this section, "noncontroversial" shall mean: (1) that no 
member of the Development Review Committee objects to the project or any portion thereof; (2) 
no specific written request has been received requesting public hearing review of the project 
from person(s) notified in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 83.010330(b); and (3) in 
the opinion of the Planning Officer, there has been no substantial objection to the proposed 
project from members of the public. If the Planning Officer determines the project to be 
controversial, the project may be referred by Planning Officer to the Planning Commission for 
action. 
(c) ?Review of Tentative Maps by Other Agencies. When a Tentative Map has been properly filed 
and the subdivider has furnished the required number of copies, the Office of Planning shall, 
within three (3) County business days of the filing and review cycle deadlines (Saturdays, 
Sundays and holidays excluded) forward a copy or copies thereof to the following: 
(1) ?County Assessor. 
(2) ?County Fire Warden, who shall distribute to the appropriate fire jurisdiction. 
(3) ?County Surveyor. 
(4) ?Building Official. 
(5) ?Director of the Department of Environmental Health Services. 
(6) ?Director of Transportation/Flood Control/ Airports and Road Commissioner. 
(7) ?District Engineer of the California Department of Transportation, Business and 
Transportation Agency, State of California, if a Federal or State highway is involved. 
(8) ?Regional Planning Team. 
(9) ?Office of Special Districts. 
(10) ?Any municipality entitled thereto. 
(11) ?Other public agencies or officers who, as determined by the Planning Agency, have an 
interest in the proposed subdivision. 
(12) ?Any appropriate public utilities and cable television system. 
(13) ?Chino Valley Regional Manager. 
(d) ?Reports on Tentative Map. Any report or recommendation on a Tentative Map by the staff of 
the Planning Agency or the Development Review Committee to the Planning Agency shall be in 
writing and a copy thereof sent to the subdivider, or any tenant of the subject property in the 
case of a proposed conversion of residential real property to a condominium project, community 
apartment project or stock cooperative project, at least three (3) days prior to any hearing or 
action on such map by such Planning Agency. In the event of failure of any officer, department, 
municipality, district or agency to report to the Planning Agency in writing within twenty (20) 
days after the filing deadline of the Tentative Map, it shall be deemed that said officer, 
department, municipality, district or agency has no objections to the proposed map. 
Wherever possible, the reports and recommendations of County departments shall be uniform in 
content and form and shall be presented to the Planning Agency by the Chairperson of the 
Development Review Committee or designee. 
(1) ?Required action in the case of waste discharge violations. The Development Review 
Committee shall report to the Planning Agency as to whether the discharge of waste from 
the proposed subdivision into an existing community sewer system will result in the 
violation of existing requirements prescribed by a California Regional Water Quality Control 
Board pursuant to Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the California Water 
Code. In the event that the Planning Agency finds that the proposed waste discharge 
would result in or add to violation of the requirements of such Board, it may disapprove the 
Tentative Map or maps of the subdivision, or take such other action as may be permitted 
by the policies of the Board of Supervisors. 
(e) ?Expiration of Approval. The initial approval period of an approved or conditionally 
approved Tentative Map and any associated development application shall expire thirty-six 
(36) months after its approval or conditional approval unless an extension is granted as 
hereinafter provided or as otherwise provided by the Development Code. The expiration of 
the approved or conditionally approved Tentative Map shall terminate all proceedings and 
no Final or Parcel Map of all or any portion of the real property included within such 
Tentative Map shall be filed without first processing a new Tentative Map. 
This initial approval period may be extended in the following circumstances: 
(1) ?If the subdivider is subject to a requirement of one hundred thousand dollars 
($100,000) or more to construct or improve or finance the construction or 
improvement of public improvements outside the boundaries of the Tentative Map in 
order to obtain a Final Map, each filing of a Final Map that is part of a series of 
multiple Final Maps authorized by Subsection 83.040201(c) of this Code and 
California Government Code Section 66456.1 shall extend the expiration of the 
approved or conditionally approved Tentative Map and any associated development 
project by thirty-six (36) months from the date of its expiration as provided in this 
section, or the date of the previously filed Final Map, whichever is later. Such 
extensions shall not extend the Tentative Map more than ten (10) years from its 
approval or conditional approval. However, a Tentative Map on property subject to a 
development agreement authorized by Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 65864) 
of Article 4 of Division 1 of the California Government Code may be extended for the 
period of time provided for in the agreement, but not beyond the duration of the 
agreement. The number of phased Final Maps which may be filed shall be determined 
by the Planning Agency at the time of the approval or conditional approval of the 
Tentative Map. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to notify the Office of 
Planning of the filing of the Final Map so that appropriate arrangements may be made 
to document such extension. 
"Public improvements," as used in this section, includes traffic controls, streets, roads, highways, 
bridges, overcrossings, street interchanges, flood control or storm drain facilities, sewer facilities, 
water facilities, and lighting facilities. 
(2) ?This period of time shall not include any period of time during which a moratorium, 
imposed after approval of the Tentative Map, is in existence, provided however that 
the length of the moratorium does not exceed five (5) years. 
Once a moratorium is terminated, the map shall be valid for the same period of time as that which 
remained of the map approval period at the time that the moratorium was imposed. However, if the 
remaining time is less than one hundred twenty (120) days, the map shall be valid for one hundred 
twenty (120) days following the termination of the moratorium. 
(3) ?In addition, this period of time, including any extension granted pursuant to 
Subsection (f), shall not include any period of time during which a lawsuit has been 
filed and is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction involving the approval or 
conditional approval of a Tentative Map if a stay of the time period is approved by the 
County pursuant to this section. Within ten (10) days of the service of the initial 
petition or complaint in the lawsuit upon the County, the subdivider may apply to the 
County for a stay pursuant to the County's adopted procedures. Within forty (40) days 
after receiving the application, the County shall either stay the time period for up to 
five (5) years or deny the requested stay. 
(f) ?Time Extensions on Approved Tentative Maps and/or any related development applications. 
The Planning Officer may approve extensions of time for a period or periods not exceeding a 
total of thirty-six (36) months unless otherwise provided by the Development Code. Any 
application of a subdivider for such extension of time shall be made in writing to the Planning 
Officer not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. Such extension of time is 
subject to an extension fee as found in the County Schedule of Fees. If the Final Map is not 
recorded within the approved extension, then the subdivision must be refiled in accordance with 
all provisions of this Division. 
(g) ?Withdrawal of Tentative Maps. Any subdivider or record owner of property upon which a 
Tentative Map has been filed may withdraw such map at any time until the recordation of the 
appropriate Final Map. Notice of such withdrawal shall be made in writing to the Planning 
Agency. Refund in filing fees for any such map withdrawn shall be made in accordance with the 
County Schedule of Fees. 
(h) ?Appeal by Subdivider. The subdivider, or any tenant of the subject property in the case of a 
proposed conversion of residential real property to a condominium project, community 
apartment project or stock cooperative project, may appeal any action of the Planning Agency 
with respect to a Tentative Map. Any such appeal shall be filed with the Office of Planning for an 
action taken by the Planning Officer, or with the Clerk of the Board for an action taken by the 
Planning Commission. Such appeals shall be filed within ten (10) days after the action of the 
Planning Agency to deny a request for extension of time for an approved or conditionally 
approved Tentative Map. After the filing of an appeal, the appeal body shall set the matter for 
public hearing. Such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the date of a request filed 
by the subdivider or the appellant. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided. Within ten (10) 
days following the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal hearing body shall render its decision. 
The decision of the appeal hearing body shall comply with the provisions of this Division and 
shall include all findings required by this Division. If the appeal hearing body fails to act upon an 
appeal within the time limit specified in this Division, the action of the Planning Agency shall be 
deemed to be upheld, and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Planning Commission or 
the Clerk of the Board, whichever body has heard the appeal, to certify such action. The fee for 
filing of an appeal shall be established in the County Schedule of Fees. 
(i) ?Complaint by Interested Person. Any interested person adversely affected by a decision of the 
Planning Agency may file a complaint with the appropriate appeal body concerning any decision 
of the Planning Agency. Any such complaint shall be filed with the Secretary of the Planning 
Commission or Clerk of the Board, depending upon the reviewing authority taking action. Such 
appeals shall be filed within ten (10) days after the action of the Planning Agency which is the 
subject of the complaint. Upon the filing of the complaint, the appeal hearing body shall set the 
matter for public hearing. Such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the filing of the 
complaint. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided. 
Upon conclusion of the hearing, the appeal body shall within ten (10) days declare its findings, based 
upon the testimony and documents produced before it, or sustain, modify, reject or overrule any 
recommendations or rulings of the Planning Agency and make such findings as are consistent with 
the provisions of this Division. 
The fee for filing of a complaint shall be the same as that required for an appeal of a subdivision. 


83.040225 - Final Map. 
The following provisions shall govern the filing and recording of the Final Map: 
(a) ?Filing the Advance Copy of the Final Map. After receipt of the report of the Planning Agency 
approving or conditionally approving the Tentative Map, and at least fifty (50) days prior to the 
expiration of the approval or conditional approval or any approved extension of time as provided 
by this Division, the subdivider may cause the real property included within the map, or any part 
thereof, to be surveyed and a Final Map thereof prepared in accordance with the approved or 
conditionally approved Tentative Map, and an advance copy of the Final Map to be submitted to 
the County Surveyor. The advance copy of the Final Map shall be accompanied by the following 
information: 
(1) ?Traverse sheets showing closures with allowable limits of exterior boundary and of 
irregular blocks and lots in subdivision. 
(2) ?Preliminary title report. 
(3) ?Fees for examining Final Map in the amount specified in the County Schedule of Fees 
adopted by the Board of Supervisors. 
(4) ?In the case of the conversion of residential property to a condominium, community 
apartment, or stock cooperative, evidence shall be submitted that the notices of intention to 
convert to prospective tenants, as required by California Government Code Section 
66427.1, have been given. 
(5) ?Composite Development Plan as subject to the provisions of Article 5 of this Division. 
(6) ?Any additional information as may be required by the Planning Agency or County 
standards shall be submitted to the appropriate County department. 
(b) ?The County Surveyor shall be the primary coordinator in seeing that the conditions of approval 
of the Tentative Map have been fulfilled. The County Surveyor shall transmit maps to and 
request written reports from the County departments and public utilities, including any cable 
television systems, which have submitted recommendations on the Tentative Map. Within 
twenty (20) days after receipt of such an advance copy of the Final Map, said Department or 
utility shall issue a preliminary written report as to the compliance or noncompliance of the 
advance Final Map as to the matters under its jurisdiction. 
(c) ?Filing Official Copy of the Final Map. If the advance copy of the Final Map has been found 
satisfactory by the County Surveyor, the subdivider shall cause the Final Map to be officially 
filed with the County Surveyor at least twenty (20) days prior to expiration of the approval or 
conditional approval or any approved extension of time as provided by this Division. The Final 
Map shall not be officially filed until the engineer or surveyor has received notification from the 
County Surveyor that all provisions of the Tentative Map approval, the Subdivision Map Act, 
County Code and County standards have been complied with. The official filing of the Final Map 
with the County Surveyor will constitute the Final Map filing date. 
(d) ?Checking and Reports to the Board of Supervisors. After the issuance of a receipt for the 
official filing of the Final Map, the County Surveyor shall examine it as to sufficiency of affidavits 
and acknowledgements, correctness of surveying data, mathematical data and computations 
and other matters which may require checking to insure compliance with the provisions of the 
Subdivision Map Act and this Division. 
If the Final Map is found to be in substantial compliance with the Tentative Map and is in correct form 
and the matters shown thereon are sufficient and the County Surveyor is satisfied that all of the 
conditions of approval have been met, County Surveyor shall endorse approval thereon. The County 
Surveyor shall combine with the Final Map the agreements, easements and securities as required by 
this Division. Such material shall be transmitted by the Environmental Public Works Agency to the 
Board of Supervisors for its consideration of the Final Map. 
(e) ?Approval of Final Map by the Board of Supervisors. 
(1) ?The Board of Supervisors shall, within a period of ten (10) days after the filing of the Final 
Map for approval or at its next regular meeting after the meeting at which it receives the 
map, whichever is later, approve the map if it conforms to all the requirements of the 
Subdivision Map Act and this Division applicable at the time of approval or conditional 
approval of the Tentative Map and any rulings made thereunder or, if it does not so 
conform, disapprove the map. 
(2) ?If the Board does not approve or disapprove the map within the prescribed time, or any 
authorized extension thereof, and the map conforms to all said requirements and rulings, it 
shall be deemed approved, and the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall certify its 
approval thereon. 
(f) ?Time Limit for Filing Final Map. If the subdivider fails to file the Final Map with the County 
Recorder and the required accompanying data with the appropriate County departments within 
thirty-six (36) months after the date of first approval by the Planning Agency or within any 
authorized extension of time, the Tentative Map approval or conditional approval shall become 
void. In such a case, a new filing fee shall be paid and a new Tentative Map approval shall be 
obtained. 
(g) ?Improvement Agreement. If at the time of approval of the Final Map by the Board of 
Supervisors, any improvements required by local ordinance or as a condition of the approval of 
the Tentative Map have not been completed in accordance with County standards applicable at 
the time of the approval or conditional approval of the Tentative Map, the Board of Supervisors, 
as a condition precedent to approval of the Final Map, shall require the subdivider to enter into 
an agreement with the Board of Supervisors upon mutually agreeable terms to thereafter 
complete such improvements at the subdivider's expense. The Board of Supervisors shall 
require that performance of such agreement is guaranteed by appropriate securities. 
(h) ?If sixty (60) days prior to the submittal of a Final or Parcel Map, the subdivider has failed to 
comply with the Tentative Map or minor subdivision plot plan conditions which require the 
subdivider to construct or install offsite improvements on land in which neither the subdivider 
nor the County has sufficient title or interest, including an easement or license, then at the time 
the Parcel or Final Map is filed with the local agency, to permit the improvements to be made, 
the subdivider shall enter into an agreement with the County through its Department of 
Engineering Contract Services to pay all costs of the County in acquiring such property. The 
County shall have one hundred twenty (120) days from the filing of the Final Map or Parcel 
Map, pursuant to Section 66457 of the Subdivision Map Act, to obtain interest in the land to 
permit the improvement(s) to be made by negotiation or proceedings pursuant to Title 7 
(commencing with Section 1230.010) of Part 3 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, 
including proceedings for immediate possession of the property under Article 3 (commencing 
with Section 1255.410) of Article 6 of such Title. In the event the County fails to meet the one 
hundred twenty (120) day time limitation, the condition for construction of offsite improvements 
shall be conclusively deemed to be waived. Prior to approval of the Final Map, the County may 
require the subdivider to enter into an agreement to complete the improvements, pursuant to 
Subsection (6) above at such time as the County acquires an interest in the land which will 
permit the improvements to be made. 
"Off-site improvements," as used in this subsection, do not include improvements which are 
necessary to assure replacement or construction of housing for persons and families of low or 
moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the California Health and Safety Code. 


83.040230 - Conditions of Map Approval. 
The conditions of map approval shall be as follows: 
(a) ?Subdivisions for which a Tentative and Final Map are required. As a condition of approval of a 
map of five (5) or more parcels, the Planning Agency may require such dedications and 
improvements as are necessary to insure that the lots to be created are provided with adequate 
public services and utilities, possibly including any appropriate cable television services, to meet 
the needs of future residents or users; are of adequate design in all respects; act to mitigate any 
potential environmental impacts identified in the Environmental Impact Report or by other 
means; and provide for proper grading and erosion control, including the prevention of 
sedimentation or damage to off-site property. All improvements shall be in accordance with 
adopted County standards. 
(b) ?Access. 
(1) ?Except as provided below, lots created by a subdivision of land shall abut upon a recorded 
dedicated public right-of-way of a width as established by the County Master Plan of 
Highways or County Highway Right-of-Way Standards, or shall be assured of access to the 
County road system by an approved access which connects a lot or lots to a maintained 
public street or state highway. 
(2) ?The Planning Agency may waive the requirements for approved access to subdivisions 
having lot sizes of forty (40) gross acres or more when all of the following findings are 
made: 
(A) ?The applicant is or will be subject to severe hardship unless the waiver is approved; 
and 
(B) ?There is an existing traveled roadway which has been in existence for at least five (5) 
years which roadway is at least twenty (20) feet in width at all points; and 
(C) ?The roadway has capability for normal passenger car use to each lot in the 
subdivision. 
(3) ?Private road easements may be approved for access to each lot if it is determined that 
public street access cannot be provided due to certain title limitations or topographical 
conditions. 
(4) ?Road easements of record established prior to the effective date of this Article shall be 
recognized as legal access to each lot of the subdivision. 
(5) ?Existing traveled roads for which a court has determined that a prescriptive right by users 
exists for public use shall be recognized as legal access to each lot of the subdivision. 
(c) ?In determining whether to approve or disapprove an application for a Tentative Map, the 
County shall apply only those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the date the 
proposal for the subdivision was accepted as complete, as provided in California Government 
Code Section 66474.2. 


Article 3 - PARCEL MAP AND MINOR SUBDIVISION PLOT PLAN 
Sections: 


83.040301 - Filing Criteria for Tentative and Parcel Maps, and Minor Subdivision Plot Plans. 
(a) ?The provisions of this section and the Subdivision Map Act shall govern the necessity for Parcel 
Maps and Minor Subdivisions. 
(1) ?A Tentative Map may be required and a Parcel Map shall be required for subdivisions where a 
Final Map is not otherwise required by this Division, unless waived pursuant to this Division. A 
Parcel Map shall not be required for subdivisions created, pursuant to California Government 
Code 66428, by short-term leases of a portion of the operating right-of-way of a railroad 
corporation defined as such by Section 230 of the California Public Utilities Code, or land 
conveyed to or from a governmental agency, public entity, common carrier, public utility, or for 
land conveyed to a subsidiary of a public utility for conveyance to such public utility for rights-of-
way. A Parcel Map may be required if a showing is made in individual cases, upon substantial 
evidence, that public policy necessitates such a Parcel Map. 
(2) ?A Parcel Map shall not be required for the construction of a condominium project or for the 
conversion of an existing structure to a condominium on a single parcel shown on a Final Map 
or Parcel Map recorded after January 1, 1960. Provided, however, the Planning Officer may 
require that a Parcel Map be filed for the purposes of obtaining improvements, additional 
easements and dedications, or other circumstances which warrant the filing of a new map. 
(3) ?The Director of the Department of Land Management except as otherwise provided may waive 
the requirement for a Parcel Map, where two (2), three (3), or four (4) parcels and any 
remainder parcel are involved, and the smallest parcel created is two and one-half (2½) gross 
acres or a two and one-half (2½) acre aliquot part of a section or greater; provided said Director 
has made a finding that the proposed division of land complies with the requirements as to: (A) 
area; (B) improvement and design; (C) flood water drainage control; (D) appropriate improved 
public roads; (E) sanitary disposal facilities; (F) potable water supply availability; (G) 
environmental protection; (H) other requirements of this Division; (I) the Subdivision Map Act; 
(J) other applicable ordinances of the County of San Bernardino; and (K) adequate survey data 
exists to identify the property as determined by the County Surveyor. A record of survey 
recorded after January 1, 1983, shall not constitute adequate survey data to permit a waiver of 
the requirement for a Parcel Map. Said finding shall be based upon evidence, information, and 
recommendations of the Development Review Committee or individual Development Review 
Committee member acting within the departmental area of expertise. 
(4) ?The Director of the Department of Land Management shall not waive a Parcel Map as a 
condition of approval of a Vesting Tentative Parcel Map. 
(5) ?Where the requirement for a Parcel Map is waived pursuant to provisions of this section, a 
Tentative Map may be required by the Planning Officer. The Planning Officer may establish 
application procedures for subdivisions which are not subject to the requirement for Tentative 
and Final Maps. 
(6) ?When a Parcel Map rather than a Final Map is required by this Division, the subdivider has the 
option of submitting a Tentative Map. 
(7) ?The subdivider shall submit a Tentative Map in place of a minor subdivision plot plan to obtain 
the rights conferred by the Subdivision Map Act and this Division for a Vesting Tentative Map. 
(8) ?The requirements of Subsection 83.040201(e), (f), and (g) shall apply to the filing of Parcel 
Maps for the conversion of residential real property to another use. 


83.040305 - Subdivision Plot Plan Content.

(a) ?Standards and Preparation. The Parcel Map shall be prepared by, or under the direction of, a 
registered Civil Engineer licensed to practice land surveying or a licensed Land Surveyor; shall 
show the location of streets and property lines bounding the property; and shall conform to all of 
the following provisions and adopted County standards. 
(1) ?The Parcel Map shall be legibly drawn, printed, or reproduced by a process guaranteeing 
a permanent record in black on tracing cloth or polyester based film. Certificates, affidavits, 
and acknow-ledgements shall be legibly stamped or printed upon the map with opaque ink. 
If ink is used on polyester based film, the ink surface shall be coated with a suitable 
substance to assure permanent legibility. 
(2) ?The size of each sheet shall be eighteen (18) by twenty-six (26) inches. A marginal line 
shall be drawn completely around each sheet, leaving an entirely blank margin of one (1) 
inch. The scale of the map shall be large enough to show all details clearly and enough 
sheets shall be used to accomplish this end. The particular number of the sheet and the 
total number of sheets comprising the map shall be stated on each of the sheets, and its 
relation to each adjoining sheet shall be clearly shown. 
(3) ?Each lot shall be numbered and each street shall be named. 
(4) ?The exterior boundary of the land included within the subdivision shall be indicated as an 
opaque ink line three (3) times as wide as the widest line on the map excluding the border 
line. The map shall show the location of each parcel and its relation to surround surveys. 
(5) ?If the map includes a remainder parcel and the gross area of the remainder parcel or 
similar named parcel is five (5) acres or less, it shall be surveyed and mapped. If the 
remainder parcel or similar named parcel is more than five (5) acres, that parcel shall show 
record information and parcel size only. 
(6) ?Existing natural drainage courses and proposed drainage easements, as necessary, shall 
be shown on the Parcel Map. 
(7) ?Additional notes which do not affect record title interests shall not be shown on the Parcel

number or numbers from the County Recorder. 
(c) ?Certificates on Parcel Maps. The statements on Parcel Maps shall be as required by the 
County Surveyor's standards and adopted by the County Board of Supervisors. 
(1) ?Subject to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, a statement, signed and 
acknowledged by the legal owner of record in the real property subdivided, consenting to 
the preparation and recordation of the Parcel Map is required. 
(2) ?Offers to dedicate interest in real property for specified public purposes shall be made by 
a statement on the Parcel Map, signed and acknowledged by the legal owner of record in 
the real property being subdivided, subject to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. 
The signature of either the holder of beneficial interests under trust deeds or the trustee 
under such trust deeds, but not both, may be omitted. The signature of either shall 
constitute a full and complete subordination of the lien of the Deed of Trust to the map and 
any interest created by the map. 
However, with respect to a division of land into four (4) or fewer parcels, where dedications or offers 
of dedications are not required, the statement shall be signed and acknowledged by the legal owner 
of record only. 
(3) ?In all cases where a Parcel Map is required, such map shall be based upon a field survey 
made in conformance with the Land Surveyors Act, except in the case of Reversion to 
Acreage. 
(4) ?The Parcel Map shall contain a certificate for execution by the County Surveyor, stating 
that the Surveyor approved the map and accepted, subject to improvement, or rejected on 
behalf of the public, any real property offered for dedication for public use in conformity 
with the terms of the offer of dedication. The County Surveyor is hereby empowered to 
accept such dedications on behalf of the County Board of Supervisors and County Flood 
Control District. 


83.040320 - Minor Subdivision Procedures. 
The provisions for the review of minor subdivision, plot plans, Tentative and Parcel Maps shall be as 
required in Section 83.040220 of this Code, unless otherwise indicated in that section.

(a) ?Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by this 
Division, requires the filing of a Tentative Map or a Tentative Parcel Map for a residential 
development, a Vesting Tentative Map may instead be filed in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
(b) ?If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of

hereinafter provided. 


83.040410 - Procedures. 
The following provisions shall govern the filing, processing and review of Vesting Tentative Maps: 
(a) ?A Vesting Tentative Map shall be processed and reviewed in the same manner as set forth in 
this Division for a Tentative Map, except as hereinafter provided. 
(1) ?Prior to filing a Vesting Tentative Map, the subdivider shall have a preapplication 
conference with the Development Review Committee to determine if any additional 
information should be filed with the Vesting Tentative Map application. The applicant shall 
submit to the Development Review Committee prior to the preapplication conference all 
information that is required of a Tentative Map application. This information will be 
reviewed by the Committee and additional information may be required by the Committee 
to be submitted with the Vesting Tentative Map application. Preliminary Environmental 
Review of the proposed project shall be completed prior to the preapplication conference. 
The minutes of the preapplication conference shall dictate the filing requirements for the Vesting 
Tentative Map, and shall accompany the filing of said map. The information required by the 
Development Review Committee for formal submission of the proposed project may include, but is 
not limited to the following: 
(A) ?Drainage plan for control of both on-site and off-site storm runoff, water courses, 
channels, existing culverts, and drainpipes including existing and proposed facilities 
for control of storm waters, data as to the amount of runoff and the approximate 
grade, and dimension of proposed facilities for control of storm waters. 
(B) ?Building envelopes. 
(C) ?Proposed land use and types of structures. 
(D) ?Detailed circulation information (existing and proposed). This information may 
include area wide traffic data sufficient for the County to determine future needs.

the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by this 
Division for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a Tentative Map. 
(5) ?Any time prior to the expiration of a Vesting Tentative Map, the subdivider or assignee 
may apply for an amendment to the Vesting Tentative Map. No application for amendment 
shall be required when the reviewing authority finds that such amendment is a minor 
modification that is in substantial compliance with the original approval and no new 
conditions of approval are required. 
(6) ?For a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the land use district or 
Specific Plan in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The

Parcel Map is recorded, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
(1) ?An initial time period of one (1) year. Where several Final Maps are recorded on various 
phases of a project covered by a single Vesting Tentative Map, this initial time period shall 
begin for each phase when the Final Map for that phase is recorded. 
(2) ?The initial time period set forth in this Code shall be automatically extended by any time used

bond or cash deposit shall be posted with the County Transportation and Flood Control 
Department for the street improvements abutting said lots as required for the approved tentative 
subdivision. 
(4) ?Filing Maps with County Recorder. After the approval by the County of a Final or Parcel Map of 
a subdivision within the unincorporated territory, the map shall be transmitted ultimately to the 
County Recorder. 
(A) ?Certificate of Taxes for Final Maps or Parcel Maps by the Clerk of the Board. When the 
subdivider files with the Clerk of the Board a certificate prepared by the appropriate state or 
local official giving his or her estimate of those taxes or assessments, and when all security 
required under the provisions of this section to secure the payment of taxes and 
assessments which are a lien on a subdivision but which are not due and payable, have 
been deposited with and approved by the County, the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors 
shall ratify that such deposits have been made and shall transmit the Final Map to the

means to correct errors which may be found in Final or Parcel Maps. 
(A) ?Amendment to a Final or Parcel Map. After a Final Map or Parcel Map is filed in the 
Office of the County Recorder, it may be amended by a certificate of correction or an 
amending map in the following circumstances: 
(I) ?To correct an error in any course or distance shown thereon; 
(II) ?To show any course or distance that was omitted therefrom; 
(III) ?To correct an error in the description of the real property shown on the map; 
(IV) ?To indicate monuments set after the death, disability, or retirement from 
practice of the engineer or surveyor charged with the responsibilities for setting 
monuments; 
(V) ?To show the proper location or character of any monument which has been 
changed in location or character or originally was shown at the wrong location or 
incorrectly as to its character; 
(VI) ?To correct any other type of map error or omission as approved by the County 
Surveyor which does not affect any property right. Such errors and omissions 
may include, but are not limited to: lot numbers, acreage, street names, and 
identification of adjacent record maps. 
(B) ?Preparation of Amending Map. The amending map or Certificate of Correction shall 
be prepared by a registered Civil Engineer licensed to practice land surveying or 
licensed Land Surveyor. An amending map shall conform to the requirements of the 
Article governing Final Map form and content, if a Final Map; or the Article governing 
Parcel Map form and content, if a Parcel Map. The amending map or Certificate of 
Correction shall set forth in detail the corrections made and show the names of the 
present fee owners of the property affected by the correction or omission. 
(C) ?Map Amendment Examined by County Surveyor. The County Surveyor shall 
examine the amending map or Certificate of Correction, and if the only changes made 
are those set forth in this subsection, the County Surveyor shall certify to this fact on 
the amending map or Certificate of Correction. 
(D) ?Filing of Map Amendment with County Recorder. The amending map or Certificate of 
Correction certified by the County Surveyor shall be filed in the Office of the County 
Recorder in which the original map was filed. Upon such filing, the County Recorder 
shall index the names of the fee owners and the appropriate tract designation shown 
on the amending map or Certificate of Correction in the general index and map index 
respectively. Thereupon, the original map shall be deemed to have been conclusively 
so corrected, and thereafter shall impart constructive notice of all such corrections in 
the same manner as though set forth upon the original map. 
(E) ?Upon recordation of an amending map or Certificate of Correction, the County 
Recorder shall within sixty (60) days of recording transmit a certified copy to the 
County Surveyor who shall maintain an index of recorded Certificates of Correction. 
The amending map shall contain a Certificate of Preparation that is signed by the 
registered civil engineer licensed to practice land surveying or licensed land surveyor 
who prepared the map and a prominently displayed note on the map which briefly lists 
the changes to the satisfaction of the County Surveyor. 
(6) ?Further modifications of Final Maps. In addition to the amendments authorized by 
Subsection 83.041105(a) (5), after a Final Map or Parcel Map is filed in the Office of the 
County Recorder, such a recorded Final Map may be modified by a Certificate of 
Correction or an amending map if the Board of Supervisors makes each of the following 
findings: 
(A) ?That there are changes in circumstances which make one or all of the conditions of 
such a map no longer appropriate or necessary; and 
(B) ?That the modifications do not impose any additional burden on the present fee owner 
of the property; and 
(C) ?That the present fee owner of the property has consented in writing to the 
modifications; and 
(D) ?That the modifications do not alter any right, title, or interest in the real property 
reflected on the recorded map; and 
(E) ?That the map, as modified, conforms with each of the findings required for map 
approval. 
Any such modification shall be set for public hearing. The Board of Supervisors shall confine the 
hearing to consideration of and action on the proposed modification. These map amendments shall 
also be subject to the preparation, review, and recordation requirements of Subsection 83.041105(a) 
(5) where applicable. 


83.041115 - General Requirements. 
The procedures set forth in this section shall govern the requirements for Soils Report, Special Map 
Requirement, Environmental Review, Dedications, Monument, and Improvement requirements. 
(a) ?Soils Report Requirement. The requirements set forth in this subsection shall apply to the Soils 
Report. 
(1) ?A preliminary soils report may be required as part of the Tentative Map approval, providing 
the Planning Officer makes a finding, based upon existing knowledge of soil qualities, that 
a preliminary analysis is necessary. Said findings shall be based upon evidence, 
information and recommendations of the Development Review Committee or Development 
Review Committee member acting within the departmental area of expertise. 
(2) ?If the County has knowledge of, or the preliminary Soils Report indicates, the present of 
critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to 
structural defects, a soils investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required. Such 
soils investigation shall be done by a Civil Engineer registered in this State, who shall 
recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each 
structure proposed to be constructed in the area where such soil problems exist. 
If the Planning Agency has knowledge of areas of districts which are characterized by such 
expansive soils or other soils problems, upon the recommendation of the Planning Officer, 
Development Review Committee or Environmental Review Committee, the Planning Agency may 
require that a soils investigation be prepared for each lot of any subdivision proposed within said 
areas or districts. 
(3) ?The Planning Agency may approve the subdivision or portion thereof where such soils 
problems exist if it determines that the Development Review Committee's recommended 
action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed. As a 
condition for the issuance of any building permit, it shall be required that the approved 
recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure. 
(4) ?Each report shall be kept on file at the Office of Building and Safety for public inspection. 
The location of these reports shall be referenced on the Composite Development Plan. 
(b) ?Special Map Requirement. Prior to Tentative or Parcel Map approval, the Planning Officer may 
require that the following information be reflected on the Tentative Map or minor subdivision plot 
plan: 
(1) ?Submittal of a map showing any or all existing easements and locations of rock outcrops, 
high groundwater and spring discharge. 
(2) ?Delineation of the portions of lots allocated for the subsurface disposal of sewage effluent. 
(3) ?The approximate size of irregularly shaped lots where it is deemed necessary in order to 
accomplish the objectives of this Article and of the General Plan. 
(4) ?A plan may be required where watercourses, significant drainage channels or bodies of 
water traverse or adjoin a lot, showing how sewage disposal systems will be installed and 
maintained. 
Lines depicting the required setbacks from such watercourses, drainage channels or bodies of water 
shall be indicated on a copy of the Tentative Map. Said map shall be reviewed by the Development 
Review Committee and recommendations shall be forwarded to the Planning Agency. When 
subsurface waste-disposal systems are proposed, a preliminary soils report shall be provided by the 
subdivider which shall ascertain the acceptability of subsurface sewage-disposal systems where 
such will be the method for waste disposal. 
This information shall be incorporated into the Composite Development Plan to be filed with the 
Office of Building and Safety. The location of any special maps shall be referenced on the Composite 
Development Plan. 
(c) ?Dedications. 
(1) ?Streets, Highways and Flood Control Rights-of-Way. As a condition of approval of a map, 
the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of all parcels of 
land within the subdivision that are needed for: 
(A) ?Streets. 
(B) ?Alleys. 
(C) ?Access rights and abutters' rights. 
(D) ?Drainage easements. 
(E) ?Public utility easements. 
(F) ?Other public easements. In addition, the subdivider shall improve or agree to improve 
all streets, alleys, including access rights and abutters' rights, drainage, public utility 
easements and other public easements. The subdivider may also be required to 
dedicate such additional land as may be necessary and feasible to provide bicycle 
paths for the use and safety of residents of the subdivision. 
(2) ?Drainage Rights-of-Way. When, in the opinion of the Planning Agency, drainage rights-of-
way are necessary, the subdivider shall offer to dedicate upon the Final Map of the 
subdivision the necessary rights-of-way for such drainage facilities. 
(3) ?Flood Control Dedication. Where dedication is offered for Flood Control District rights-of-
way, such rights-of-way shall be shown as lots lettered alphabetically on the Final Map. 
Such offer of dedication shall be made by an appropriate certificate on the title sheet of the 
Final Map, and, in addition, an executed deed conveying fee title to said right-of-way to the 
Flood Control District shall be delivered to said District. 
(4) ?Certification of Board Action. At the time the Board of Supervisors approves a Final Map, it 
shall also accept, subject to improvement, or reject any offer of dedication. The Clerk of the 
Board shall certify on the map the action of the Board of Supervisors. 
(5) ?Resolution of Acceptance. The Clerk of the Board shall cause a resolution of acceptance 
of dedications by the Board of Supervisors, to be filed with the County Recorder. 
(6) ?If at the time the Final Map is approved, any streets, paths, alleys, public utility 
easements, rights-of-way for local transit facilities such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, 
landing pads, and similar items, which directly benefit the residents of a subdivision, or 
storm drainage easements are rejected, subject to Section 771.010 of the California Code 
of Civil Procedure, the offer of dedication shall remain open and the Board of Supervisors 
may by resolution at any later date, and without further action by the subdivider, rescind its 
action and accept and open the streets, paths, alleys, rights-of-way for local transit facilities 
such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads, and similar items, which directly 
benefit the residents of a subdivision, or storm drainage easements for public use. Such 
acceptance shall be recorded in the Office of the County Recorder. 
(d) ?Monuments. The provisions of this subsection shall govern the placement of monuments for a 
subdivision. 
(1) ?Boundary Monuments. At the time of making the survey for the Parcel Map or the Final 
Map, the engineer or surveyor shall set sufficient durable monuments to conform with the 
County Surveyor's standards and standards described in Section 8771 of the California 
Business and Professions Code so that another engineer or surveyor may readily retrace 
the survey. The Parcel Map or the Final Map shall show said monuments found or set at or 
near each boundary corner and at intermediate points approximately one thousand (1,000) 
feet apart or at such lesser distances as may be made necessary by topography or contour 
to insure accuracy in reestablishment of any point or line without unreasonable difficulty. 
The precise position and character of each monument shall be shown on the Final Map, 
together with the relative heights of the top of each such monument with respect to the 
surface of the ground. 
(2) ?Deferment, Final Map or Parcel Map Monuments. Interior monuments need not be set at 
the time the Final Map is filed if the engineer or surveyor certifies on the map that the 
monuments will be set on or before a specified later date. All monuments so deferred and 
the furnishing of notes thereon as required in County Surveyor's standards, shall be 
agreed to be set and furnished by the subdivider. Such agreement shall be included and 
guaranteed in the "agreement in Lieu of Improvements" as provided by this Division and 
accompanied by a cash deposit. 
(3) ?Monument Inspection. All monuments shall be subject to inspection and approval by the 
County Surveyor. 
(4) ?Centerline Monuments. Durable monuments as described in County Surveyor's standards 
shall be set. 
(e) ?Improvement Plans: 
(1) ?Submission of Improvement Plans. All improvement plans shall be submitted to the 
appropriate County agency or department, checked and approved prior to presentation of 
the Final Map to the Board of Supervisors for acceptance. 
(2) ?Preparation of Plans and Specifications. All plans and specifications in connection with 
improvements shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered professional 
engineer. 
(3) ?Street and Drainage Plans and Profiles. Plans, profiles and specifications of proposed 
street and drainage improvements shall be submitted to the County Transportation and 
Flood Control Department, checked and approved prior to presentation of the Final Map to 
the Board of Supervisors for acceptance. These plans and profiles shall show full details of 
the proposed improvements which shall be according to the standards of the County of 
San Bernardino. 
(4) ?Water Systems Plans. Plans, specifications and all necessary details of the proposed 
water system to be installed shall be submitted to the Director of the Department of 
Environmental Health Services for review, provided that the supplier has certified that it is 
willing and able to supply water upon request. 
(5) ?Sanitary Sewer Plans. Plans, profiles, specifications and all necessary details of the 
sanitary sewers to be installed shall be submitted to the Director of the Department of 
Environmental Health Services for review; provided, however, that prior to submitting such 
plans, that shall have been approved by the governmental jurisdiction by which the 
subdivision is to be served, or if a private sewage disposal company is to service the tract, 
the plans shall have been approved by the Director of the Department of Environmental 
Health Services. 


83.041120 - Subdivision Design and Improvement Standards. 
The Design and Improvement Standards found in this section shall be considered as requirements for 
map approval. 
(a) ?Land-Use Standards. The land-use standards in this subsection shall be applied as 
requirements for map approval. 
The minimum areas and dimensions of lots shall be as required for the particular land use district 
classification in which the property is classified by the San Bernardino County Development Code; 
provided, however, that: 
(1) ?Lot or parcel side lines shall be approximately normal to street lines. 
(2) ?Each lot or parcel on a dead-end street where the side lines thereof are converging from 
front to the rear of such lot or parcel, shall have an average width of not less than sixty (60) 
feet, or that width required by the Development Code, whichever is greater, measured 
along the front building setback line. 
(3) ?Each lot or parcel on a curved street where the side lines thereof are converging from the 
front to the rear of such lot or parcel, shall have an average width of not less than sixty (60) 
feet, or that width required by the Development Code, whichever is greater. 
(4) ?Double frontage lots shall be discouraged except where essential to provide separation of 
residential developments from major or secondary highways or due to topographical 
conditions. When double frontage lots are permitted, vehicular access rights shall be 
dedicated to the County along the street designated by the Planning Agency. 
(5) ?The Planning Agency may require lots larger than the above minimum sizes specified in 
multiple-residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions. 
When lots or parcels twice or more the required area or width are shown as part of a subdivision of 
land, the Planning Agency may require such lots or parcels to be so established as to make practical 
a further division into allowable building sites, without injury to adjoining property. 
(6) ?In desert areas or in hilly or mountainous lands, the Planning Agency may require lots 
larger than required minimums. Larger lots shall be required if it is deemed necessary in 
order to conform to the Land Use Element of the County General Plan. 
(7) ?Modification of the Lot Design Standards may be allowed under the following 
circumstances: 
(A) ?Pursuant to the Lot Area Regulations of Division 7, Chapter 4, of Title 8 of this Code. 
(B) ?Pursuant to the Planned Development regulations of Division 8, Chapter 5, of Title 8 
of this Code. 
(8) ?This subsection does not apply to any lot or parcel which the subdivider offers to dedicate 
to the County or any public agency or district. 
(9) ?When a land use district classification line divides a lot or parcel, the area and frontage 
requirements for such lot or parcel shall be those of the land use district that requires the 
greater or most restrictive standards between the two districts involved. 
EXAMPLE: If the Line between a Neighborhood Commercial (CN) District and a Single Residential 
(RS) District divides a parcel, the applicable area and frontage requirements would be those for the 
CN as they are greater than those for the RS District. 
(b) ?Circulation Standards. The circulation standards in this subsection shall be applied as 
requirements for map approval. 
(1) ?If the General Plan designates a general location of a proposed highway and any portion 
thereof may be wholly or partially within any proposed subdivision or may be affected by a 
proposed subdivision prior to the approval of the proposed subdivision, a specific 
alignment plan shall be prepared and adopted. Each such roadway shall conform in width 
and alignment with that shown or indicated on the General or Specific Plan or any 
standards adopted pursuant thereto. As a condition of approval of said subdivision, the 
subdivider shall be required to make dedications and construct such reasonable 
improvements as required by the specific alignment plan. Such requirements may be 
waived by the Planning Agency upon recommendation of the County Transportation and 
Flood Control Department, if the proposed highway is located upon a section line or its 
precise alignment can be otherwise determined. 
(2) ?The following provisions shall apply as standards governing circulation design and shall 
be required for map approval: 
(A) ?The circulation design of all subdivisions shall be compatible and coordinate with the 
County General Plan and the existing street and land use pattern in the surrounding 
area. 
(B) ?Any part-width highway lying along and adjacent to any boundary of a subdivision 
shall have such a part-width and alignment as will conform to the route lines shown on 
the Master Plan of Highways covering the same portion of such subdivision. 
(C) ?Each street intended to be extended into adjoining property shall be terminated by a 
one (1) foot parcel of land extending across the end of the street and, in the case of a 
part-width street, a one (1) foot parcel of land shall extend along the entire side of the 
street. Said parcels shall be designated alphabetically as a lot, labeled as a future 
street and offered for dedication by appropriate certificate on the Final or Parcel Map. 
The offer of dedication of said future street shall include a restriction against the use 
of same for access purposes until such time as it is accepted as a public street. 
Where it is determined by the Planning Agency that to protect the public health, safety 
and general welfare, it is necessary to extend a street beyond the boundaries of the 
subdivision for adequate traffic needs, the subdivider shall provide separate deeds for 
the necessary easements or rights-of-way to accommodate such traffic facilities. Such 
rights-of-way shall be improved in accordance with County standards or as required 
by the Planning Agency. 
(D) ?Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, except as provided 
below, and shall terminate with a turn-around as specified in the adopted County 
Road Standards. The Planning Agency may approved a cul-de-sac which exceeds six 
hundred (600) feet if the Planning Agency finds that said cul-de-sac will not be 
injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(E) ?Road grades shall not exceed twelve percent (12%) unless it can be demonstrated 
that in order to accomplish the objectives of the County General Plan a road grade in 
excess of twelve percent (12%) is necessary. In such circumstances, the Planning 
Agency may approve a road grade not to exceed fourteen percent (14%) grade for a 
distance not to exceed five hundred (500) feet if a finding is made, based upon the 
recommendations of the County Director of Transportation and Flood Control and the 
County Fire Warden, that said roadway will not create an unacceptable hazardous risk 
to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(F) ?Access to a Subdivision. The subdivision and each phase thereof shall have two (2) 
points of vehicular ingress and egress from existing and surrounding streets, one of 
which may be emergency only. Where providing such access is physically impossible 
or a cul-de-sac is proposed, this requirement may be waived or modified. 
(c) ?Public Services and Facilities. The public services and facilities standards in this subsection 
shall be applied as requirements for map approval. 
(1) ?These standards shall regulate the placement of utilities within the subdivision. 
(A) ?Utility lines, including but not limited to electric, telephone, communications, street 
lighting and cable television, within or directly serving each subdivision, shall be 
placed underground. The subdivider is responsible for complying with the 
requirements of this subsection without expense to the County, and he shall make 
necessary arrangements with the utility company for the installation of such facilities. 
Appurtenances and associated equipment such as boxes and meter cabinets and 
concealed ducts in an underground system may be placed above ground. Waiver of 
the requirements for underground utilities shall be made through the Public Utilities 
Commission. This subsection shall not apply to existing utility or common carrier 
routes in use at the time the subdivision is completed which do not provide service to 
the area subdivided. Aerial routes still in existence at the time the subdivision is 
completed may be reinforced from time to time as conditions dictate; however, all 
provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the requirements of any underground 
district created pursuant to San Bernardino County Code Section 67.011 in existence 
prior to the subdivision of the land or created subsequent thereto. 
(B) ?Overhead utility lines where permitted shall be located at the rear of lots or parcels 
where practical, and along the sides of lots or parcels where necessary. 
(C) ?If a local cable television system is available to serve the project, any subdivision for 
which a Tentative Map is required shall be designed to provide the appropriate cable 
television system an opportunity to construct, install, and maintain on land as reserved 
for cable television service or by separate instrument, any equipment necessary to 
extend cable television services to each residential parcel in the subdivision. 
"Appropriate cable television systems," as used in this subsection, means those franchised or 
licensed to serve the geographical area in which the subdivision is located. 
This subsection shall not apply to the conversion of existing dwelling units to condominiums, 
community apartments, or stock cooperatives. 
(D) ?Whenever the County imposes as a condition of its approval of a Tentative Map or a 
Parcel Map a requirement that necessitates replacing, undergrounding, or 
permanently or tempor-arily relocating existing facilities of a telephone corporation or 
cable television system, common carrier or other public utility, the developer or 
subdivider shall reimburse the appropriate facility provider for all costs for the 
replacement, undergrounding, or relocation. All these costs shall be billed after they 
are incurred, and shall include a credit for any required advance payments and for the 
salvage value of any facilities replaced. Under no circumstances shall the telephone 
corporation or cable television system be reimbursed for costs incurred in excess of 
the cost to replace the facilities with substantially similar facilities. 
(2) ?Public Services and Facilities Fees. The fee requirements of Division 1 of Title 8 of this 
Code shall be imposed as conditions of all map approvals, including Parcel Maps. 
(d) ?The standards herein shall be related to public safety. 
(1) ?The standards herein shall govern drainage works. 
(A) ?When a subdivision lies in the path of existing watercourses or overflows therefrom 
or natural drainage from upstream properties, it shall not be approved unless 
adequate dedicated rights-of-way or improvements are provided in a manner 
satisfactory to the Planning Agency. 
(B) ?When, in the opinion of the Planning Agency, a subdivision may cause an unnatural 
increase or concentration of surface waters onto downstream property, said 
subdivision shall not be approved by the Planning Agency unless drainage outlets are 
provided which will be adequate to render the County of San Bernardino and the 
County Flood Control District harmless from any damages caused therefrom. 
(C) ?The location, type and size of watercourses or drainage works, and all drainage of 
streets and other drainage works between streets, shall be in accordance with County 
standards or as required by the Planning Agency. 
(D) ?When, in the opinion of the Planning Agency, drainage rights-of-way are necessary, 
the subdivider shall offer to dedicate upon the Final Map of the subdivision the 
necessary rights-of-way for such drainage facilities. 
(E) ?Where dedication is offered or granted for Flood Control District rights-of-way, such 
rights-of-way shall be shown as lots lettered alphabetically on the Final Map. Such 
offer of dedication or grant shall be made by an appropriate statement on the title 
sheet of the Final map. 
(2) ?The standards contained herein related to fire protection measures shall be considered as 
requirements for map approval. 
(A) ?Subdivision design shall provide for safe and ready access for fire and other 
emergency equipment and for routes of escape to safely handle evacuations. 
(B) ?The subdivision shall be served by water supplies for community fire protection in 
accordance with the standards set by the appropriate fire authority. 
(C) ?In hazardous fire areas, all flammable or combustible vegetation shall be removed 
from around all structures, in accordance with the requirements of the San Bernardino 
County Uniform Fire Code. Where erosion is probable, the slopes shall be planted 
with fire resistive ground cover. 
(3) ?The standards contained herein related to sewage disposal systems shall be considered 
as requirements for map approval. 
(A) ?Subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be located as far as practical from a 
perennial or intermittent stream pursuant to San Bernardino County Code, Division 3, 
Article 5, Sections 33.055 and 33.056, and the requirements of the Department of 
Environmental Health Services and the Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
(B) ?When a soils or a geologic hazards report for a subdivision is prepared (either at the 
developer's volition or as a requirement of any governmental agency), it shall include 
findings and recommendations concerning probable adverse effects of such hazards 
to the integrity of water supply and sewage disposal facilities and structures. 
(e) ?Environmental and Public Health. Lands to be subdivided for residential, park, playground or 
land recreation purposes may be subject to environmental quality standards as established by 
ordinances and regulations of the different departments and agencies within the County. 


83.041125 - Improvement Security. 
The necessity for improvement security and the related requirements shall be governed by the following 
regulations: 
(a) ?Requirement for Improvement Security. If all required improvements, engineering and 
inspection are not satisfactorily completed before the Final Map is approved, the owner or 
owners of the subdivision shall, prior to the approval of the Final Map, enter as contractor into 
an agreement with the County Board of Supervisors whereby in consideration of the acceptance 
by the County Board of Supervisors of the streets, easements and any other land offered for 
dedication, the contractor agrees to furnish the equipment, labor and material necessary to 
complete the work within the time specified in the agreement.

(100%) of the contract for the faithful performance of the work, and has further 
bonded to the nonprofit corporation and the County as co-obligee an amount of 
not less than fifty percent (50%) of the contract for the payment of labor and 
materials, and those bonds comply with the provisions of this Article. 
(II) ?All moneys payable to the contractor by the nonprofit corporation are deposited 
in a depository complying with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and out 
of which moneys progress payments are conditioned upon:

upon in the contract for the work. No less than ten percent (10%) of the total 
contract price shall be retained for the sixty (60) days following the filing of the 
notice of completion. 
(D) ?An amount as determined by the County Director of Transportation and Flood 
Control, but not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total estimated cost of 
improvements or performance of the required act necessary for the guarantee and 
warranty of the improvement for a period of one (1) year following the completion and 
acceptance thereof, against any defective work or labor done, or defective materials 
furnished. 
As part of the obligation guaranteed by the security and in addition to the face amount of the 
security, there shall be included costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable 
attorney's fees incurred by the County in successfully enforcing the obligation secured.

and shall not be subject to enforcement of a money judgement by any creditors of the depositor until 
the obligation secured thereby is performed to the satisfaction of the County. 
(3) ?Forfeiture on Failure to Complete. Upon the failure of a subdivider to complete any 
improvements and work within two (2) years from the date the agreement is executed, the 
County Board of Supervisors may, upon notice in writing served by registered mail 
addressed to the last known address of the person, firm or corporation signing such 
contract, determine that said improvement work or any part thereof is uncompleted and 
may cause to be forfeited to the County or Flood Control District, such sum of money or

Code and other acceptance of the work, be reduced to an amount equal to the total 
claimed by all claimants for whom claims of lien have been recorded and notice 
thereof given in writing to the County Board of Supervisors, and if no such claims 
have been recorded, the security shall be released in full. 
Such release shall not apply to any required guarantee and warranty period, nor to the amount of the 
security deemed necessary by the County for such guarantee and warranty period, nor to cost and 
reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees.

event of such defective work, the security shall be held until all work is considered 
satisfactory and acceptable by the County. 
(5) ?Reimbursement for (Oversized) Supplemental Improvements. The Planning Agency may, 
at the request of a public agency, require that the improvements installed for the benefit of 
the subdivision contain supplemental size, capacity or number for the benefit of property 
not within the subdivision as a condition precedent to the approval of a subdivision or 
Parcel Map, and thereafter dedication of such improvements to the said public agency. 
However, the subdivider shall be reimbursed by said public agency for that portion of the 
cost of such improvements equal to the difference between actual cost and the amount it 
would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements pursuant to the provisions of 
the Subdivision Map Act. Standards and procedures for requiring such improvements and 
for reimbursement shall be contained in the operating rules and regulations of said public 
agencies and shall be made a public record. 


Article 12 - ENFORCEMENT 
Sections: 
The procedures set forth in this Article shall provide for the enforcement of the State Subdivision Map Act 
and the provisions of this Division of the San Bernardino County Code in conjunction with those 
provisions specified by Division 1, Chapter 2, of this Title. 


83.041201 - Prohibition and Penalty. 
This section shall provide the prohibition and penalty provisions of this division. 
(a) ?Prohibition on Transfers. No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or portion of parcels 
of real property, or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, 
except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a Final Map or Parcel Map is 
required by this Division and the Subdivision Map Act, until such map thereof in full compliance 
with the provisions of this Division has been filed for record by the County Recorder. 
Conveyance of any part of a division of real property for which a Final or Parcel Map is required by 
this Division shall not be made by parcel or block number, initial or other designation, unless and 
until such map has been filed for record by the County Recorder. 
(b) ?Prohibition on Issuance of Permits. No officer, board, commission, agency, department or 
special district of the County shall issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to develop 
any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of 
the provisions of this Division if it finds or is informed by the Planning Officer that development 
of such real property is contrary to the public health and safety. Prior to making such a finding 
that the development of such real property is contrary to the public health and safety, the 
Planning Officer shall conduct a review. 
At said review, the Officer shall consider all information and evidence submitted. The decision of the 
Planning Officer may be appealed therefrom, within thirty (30) days, to the Planning Commission by 
any person aggrieved, or by an officer, board, department or agency of the County. The authority to 
deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefore was the owner of 
the real property at the time of such violation, or whether the applicant therefor, if the current owner 
of the real property, was with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time 
of such violation, at the time of the acquisition of his interest in such real property. If any officer, 
board, commission, agency, department or special district of the County issues any permit or grants 
approval for the development of any such real property, it may request a report from the Planning 
Officer and impose any additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the 
property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. 
For parcels created before March 4, 1972, notice of said review shall be given, by registered mail, to 
the owner of such real property as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll book. Said review 
shall be held not less than fourteen (14) days nor more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the 
owner of the notice of review. 
(c) ?Statement of Limitations. This section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision 
offered for sale or lease, contract for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or 
exempt from any law regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time 
the subdivision was established. 
(d) ?Penalties. Penalties shall be as specified in Division 1, Chapter 2, of this Title. 


83.041205 - Remedies. 
The following remedies are available pursuant to the provisions of this subsection: 
(a) ?Voiding of Sale by Grantee. Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property 
which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of 
this Division is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to 
purchase, heirs, personal representative or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one (1) 
year after the date of discovery of the violation of the provisions of this division; but the deed of 
conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, 
buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the 
grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or any assignee, heir or devisee. 
(b) ?Superior Court Action by Grantee. Any grantee, or his successor in interest, of real property 
which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of 
this Division may, within one (1) year of the date of discovery of such violation bring an action in 
the Superior Court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such division of 
property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property in violation of 
the provisions of this Division, and against any successors in interest who have actual or 
constructive knowledge of such a division of property. 
(c) ?Statement of Limitations. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of 
any parcel of real property identified in a Certificate of Subdivision Compliance filed pursuant to 
Article 9, or identified in a recorded Final Subdivision Map, Parcel Map, or Official Map and after 
the date of recording. The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights 
of a grantee or his successor in interest under any other provision of law. 
This subsection does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which any aggrieved local 
agency or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled. Any 
such local agency or other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit 
regarding any real property attempted to be subdivided or sold, leased or financed in violation of this 
Division, or to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision or sale, lease or financing in 
violation of this Division, in the Superior Court of the County of San Bernardino. 
(d) ?Request for Certificate of Subdivision Compliance. Any person owning real property may 
request a Certificate of Subdivision Compliance in accordance with the provisions of Article 9. 
(e) ?Notice of Violation. Whenever the Planning Officer has knowledge that real property has been 
divided in violation of the provisions of this division, then within the guidelines set forth by 
County Counsel, the Planning Officer shall cause to be mailed by certified mail to the then 
current owner of record of the property a Notice of Intention to record a Notice of Violation, 
describing the real property in detail, naming the owners thereof, describing the violation, and 
stating that an opportunity will be given to the owner to present evidence. The notice shall 
specify a time, date and place at which the owner may present evidence to the Planning Agency 
why such notice should not be recorded. The notice shall also contain a description of the 
violations and an explanation as to why the subject parcel is not lawful under Subdivision (a) or 
(b) of Section 66412.6 of the Government Code for the State of California. Evidence shall be 
presented by the owner to the Planning Agency no sooner than thirty (30) days and no later 
than sixty (60) days from the date of mailing. If, after the owner has presented evidence, it is 
determined that there has been no violation, the Planning Officer shall cause to be filed for 
record with the County Recorder a release of the Notice of Intention to record a Notice of 
Violation. If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the Planning Agency determines 
that the property has in fact been illegally divided, or if within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such 
copy the owner of such real property fails to inform the Planning Agency of his objection to 
recording the Notice of Violation, the Planning Agency shall cause to be filed for record with the 
County Recorder the Notice of Violation. The Notice of Intention to record a Notice of Violation 
and the Notice of Violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the 
violation to all successors in interest in such property. The County Recorder shall index the 
names of the fee owners in the general index. 


Article 13 - RESIDENT INITIATED MOBILEHOME PARK CONVERSION 
Sections: 


83.041301 - Intent. 
The intent of this Article is to facilitate resident purchase of mobilehome parks. This Article allows the 
waiver of certain subdivision requirements and expedites local government processing for mobilehome 
park conversions to condominiums or stock cooperatives. Such conversions will preserve an important 
source of affordable housing. 
For the purposes of this Article, an application for subdivision shall be considered "resident initiated" when 
signed by a resident organization formed by the tenants of the subject mobilehome park for the purpose 
of purchasing the mobilehome park. The proposed conversion shall be supported by a minimum of two-
thirds ( 2/3 ) of the current residents of the park. The resident organization shall have a legally binding 
contract, which, if the conditions of the contract are met, would result in the acquisition of an interest in 
the mobilehome park. A preapplication conference may be requested by the applicant(s) prior to 
formation of the resident organization or prior to entering into a legally binding contract provided the 
Planning Agency determines in writing that it is reasonable to believe that such contract may be entered 
into within one (1) year. 


83.041305 - Exclusions. 
The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the following: 
(a) ?The purchase of a mobilehome park by a non-profit corporation which is subject to the 
provisions of Section 11010.8 of the California Business and Professions Code. 
(b) ?Special Occupancy Parks (e.g. Recreation Vehicle Parks) as defined in Section 2008 of the 
Mobilehome Parks Act, Title 25 of the California State Administrative Code. 


83.041310 - Waiver of Tentative and Final Map Requirements. 
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Division the requirement for the filing of a Tentative Subdivision 
Map and the preparation, filing and recordation of a Final Map, for a mobilehome park conversion to a 
condominium or stock cooperative on a single parcel, may be waived by the Planning Agency provided 
that the following procedures are followed by a resident organization desiring to convert their park and the 
necessary findings are made by the Planning Agency: 
(a) ?Pre-application conference. 
Prior to filing an application for mobilehome park conversion the resident association shall have a 
preapplication conference with the Development Review Committee. This conference shall be 
scheduled in accordance with the policy established by the Board for the Housing Incentive Program. 
The purpose of this conference is to determine that the proposal qualifies under the provisions of this 
Article. 
The following information shall be submitted with the application for this conference: 
(1) ?Previously approved plot plan for the mobilehome park. If none exists, a plot plan shall be 
filed in accordance with the requirements established by the County reviewing authority 
and available at the information counter of the San Bernardino County Government Center 
or in the regional offices of the Department of Land Management. 
(2) ?A supplemental report to include the following information: 
(A) ?Name of consultant(s), if any. 
(B) ?Disclosure of all known fees and costs for the conversion process. 
(C) ?Documentation demonstrating that two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the residents of the 
mobilehome park support the proposed conversion. 
(D) ?Declarations from those residents supporting the conversion that their principal place 
of residence is within the subject mobilehome park. 
(E) ?The location of the park and results of a field inspection done by the applicant(s) or 
consultant regarding the status of the compliance of the park with the County health 
and safety standards in effect at the time the park was created. Any on-site 
dedications or public improvements to be required, if any, shall be identified by the 
committee. 
(F) ?Proposed tentative schedules to expedite meeting and coordinating any 
requirements of the San Bernardino County Planning Agency and the Department of 
Real Estate, including but not limited to the Public Report. Such schedule shall include 
an outline of the permits and noticing required to allow this conversion and the 
estimated time at which such permits are obtained. 
(G) ?Evidence showing that the sixty (60) day Notice of Intent to file the conversion 
application [as required by Subsection 66427.1(a) of the Subdivision Map Act] has 
been met. 
(H) ?Initial report on the impact of the conversion on the residents of the mobilehome 
park. This report is needed to determine whether an impact report as required in 
Section 66427.4 of the Subdivision Map Act is needed. The report shall specify 
whether any residents of the park are to be involuntarily displaced and any proposed 
measures to mitigate such displacement. A resident who is offered an opportunity to 
remain in the park after the conversion through continuation of the tenancy at 
generally the same terms as existed prior to proposed conversion, shall not be 
considered involuntarily displaced. At the preapplication conference the Development 
Review Committee shall indicate whether an impact report needs to be filed with the 
formal application for the conversion. If it is required, the Development Review 
Committee shall identify in detail any additional items to be required as mitigation 
measures to assist any displaced residents. No current resident shall be involuntarily 
displaced without proper notice, assistance or compensation, to be worked out on a 
case-by-case basis. Such noticing, assistance or compensation may include, but is 
not limited to, the following: 
(I) ?The project shall comply with the mobilehome Residency Law, Section 798, et. 
seq., of the California Civil Code. 
(II) ?The project applicant(s) may be required to provide relocation assistance 
pursuant to federal, state or local laws. 
(b) ?The Development Review Committee shall field check the park prior to the scheduled meeting. 
The Development Review Committee shall establish if the proposed mobilehome park 
conversion meets the intent and is capable of meeting the provisions of this Article. The 
Planning Officer shall attempt to inform the applicant(s) at the earliest opportunity if a public 
hearing is to be required. If the proposed mobilehome park conversion is acceptable, the 
Development Review Committee shall identify the information the applicant needs to file to 
proceed with the proposal. Such information shall include the following: 
(1) ?Development Review Committee preap-plication conference minutes. These minutes shall 
include the proposed tentative schedules required by Subsection 83.041310 (a)(2)(F). 
(2) ?If the parcel upon which the park lies was created prior to January 1, 1960, a Parcel Map 
Application shall be required. Such application shall be processed concurrently with any 
other information filed pursuant to the preapplication conference. 
(3) ?Mobilehome Park Conversion Impact Report, if required at the preapplication conference 
to meet the requirements of Section 66427.4 of the Subdivision Map Act. Such report shall 
be given to each resident within the mobilehome park. 
(4) ?Mobilehome Park Plot Plan if no plot plan was previously approved. 
(5) ?Any special information which was identified by the committee. Among such information 
may be information to assist in the environmental review of the proposal. 
(6) ?Certificate of Subdivision Compliance Application. 
The review and processing of any application pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same 
review and time requirements and appeal procedures as are provided in this Division for Tentative 
Subdivision Maps. In any case where waiver of the Tentative and Final Map is granted the Planning 
Officer shall cause to be filed for record with the County Recorder a Certificate of Subdivision 
Compliance pursuant to Article 9 of this Division. The Planning Officer may require a public hearing 
pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 83.040220(b) of this Code. Should a public hearing be 
required the noticing provisions of Section 66451.3 of the Subdivision Map Act shall be met. 
(c) ?Findings of Approval. 
A mobilehome park conversion shall be approved or conditionally approved only if the following are 
found and justified as being true: 
(1) ?The mobilehome park complies with the requirements established by State law and 
County Ordinance for such uses at the time the mobilehome park was constructed. Such 
regulations shall include those regarding to area, improvement and design, flood water 
drainage control, public roads, sanitary disposal facilities, water supply and distribution 
systems, environmental protection and other requirements of the Subdivision Map Act or 
this Division. 
(2) ?Any measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the conversion on current residents of 
the park have been required as conditions of approval. 
(3) ?Applicable noticing requirements of the Subdivision Map Act have been, or will be met. 
(d) ?Conditions of Approval. 
The following conditions may be required by the Planning Agency as conditions of approval for the 
proposed conversion: 
(1) ?Subdivisions permitted by this Article may include conditions requiring a Compliance 
Survey inspection to the satisfaction of the Planning Agency. However, such survey shall 
be limited to require improvements relating only to items of a health and safety nature. 
(2) ?The mobilehome condominiums or stock cooperatives shall be subject to Title 25 of the 
California State Administrative Code. 
(3) ?Only additional onsite improvements or development standards which were applicable at

on permanent foundations as a result of the conditional approval. 


CHAPTER 5 - RIPARIAN PLANT CONSERVATION 
Sections: 


89.0501 - Purpose. 
The County finds that it is in the public interest to promote healthy and abundant riparian habitats. 
Riparian habitats are located along the sides of canyon bottoms, streams and rivers, providing watershed 
protection as well as control transmission and storage of natural water supplies. Riparian areas provide a 
unique wildlife habitat and contribute to an attractive environment. Rare, endangered and threatened 
plants and animals are most often found in riparian areas. Riparian areas also provide natural soil erosion 
and sedimentation control protecting stream banks subject to erosion and undercutting. In addition 
riparian areas provide sufficient shade to reduce temperature and evaporation and the growth of algae in 
streams. The provisions of this chapter are designed to augment and coordinate with the responsibilities 
of the California Department of Fish and Game. 


89.0505 - Scope. 
(a) ?The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all riparian areas located on private land within the 
unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County and to riparian areas on public land owned by the 
County of San Bernardino, except as specified by Chapter 1 of this Division and this chapter. 
(b) ?EXCEPTIONS. 
(1) ?The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to emergency Flood Control District operations 
or water conservation measures established and authorized by an appropriate independent 
Special District with such responsibility. 
(2) ?The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to any area that has an existing man-made 
impervious structure which is greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in roof area 
between the area proposed to be disturbed by a development permit and the bank of a subject 
stream, as measured in a straight line perpendicular to the centerline of such stream. 


89.0510 - Subject Areas and Plants. 
The removal of any vegetation within two hundred (200) feet of the bank of a stream or in an area 
indicated as a protected riparian area on an overlay map or Specific Plan, shall be subject to a tree or 
plant removal permit in accordance with the procedures detailed by Chapters 3 and 4 of this Division for 
each respective regional area and shall be subject to environmental review, except as otherwise provided 
or excepted by the provisions of this Division. For the purposes of this chapter, streams include those 
shown on United States Geological Survey Quadrangle topographic maps as perennial or intermittent, 
blue or brown lines (solid or dashed), and river wash areas. Pre-construction inspections shall include the 
verification of the presence of any riparian vegetation. Any necessary conditions of approval for removal 
of riparian vegetation may be imposed in addition to and in combination with any condition imposed 
pursuant to Chapters 3 and 4 of this Division. 


DIVISION 10 - SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 
Chapters: 


CHAPTER 1 - SURFACE MINING AND LAND RECLAMATION 
Sections: 


810.0101 - Intent. 
It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors to create and maintain an effective and comprehensive surface 
mining and reclamation policy with regulation of surface mining operations so as to assure that: 
(a) ?Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized and that mined lands are reclaimed 
to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land use. 
(b) ?The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged, while giving consideration to 
values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage and aesthetic enjoyment. 
(c) ?Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated. 
(d) ?The extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic well-being of the County and 
to the needs of society, and that reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize 
adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety. 
(e) ?The reclamation of mined lands as provided in this chapter will permit the continued mining of 
minerals and will provide for the protection and subsequent beneficial use of the mined and 
reclaimed land. 
(f) ?Surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological 
and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the 
specification therefore may vary accordingly. 


810.0110 - Scope. 
(a) ?The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County. 
(b) ?The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to: 
(1) ?Excavations or grading for farming, on-site construction or restoration of land following a flood 
or natural disaster. 
(2) ?Reclamation of lands mined prior to January 1, 1976. 
(3) ?Operations conducted prior to January 1, 1976, on mining claims located under the mining laws 
of 1872, et seq., and not recorded by January 1, 1976, as abandoned. 
(4) ?Those underground operations with tailings or waste dumps in total amounts of less than one 
thousand (1,000) cubic yards not exceeding one (1) acre in extent at any one site of 
underground access opening, providing such openings are secured. 
(5) ?Surface mining operations that are required by Federal law in order to protect a mining claim, if 
such operations are conducted solely for that purpose. 
(6) ?Prospecting for, or the extraction of, minerals for commercial purposes and the removal of 
overburden in total amounts of less than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards in any one location 
of one (1) acre or less. 
(7) ?Such operations that the County determines to be of an infrequent nature and that involve only 
minor surface disturbance. 


810.0115 - Conditional Use Permit and Reclamation Plan Required. 
(a) ?Any person who proposes to engage in surface mining activity shall, prior to the commencement of 
said operations, first file and obtain approval from the Planning Officer for a Conditional Use Permit 
application as provided in Section 84.0320 of the Development Code and a Reclamation Plan in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in this Chapter, and as further provided in Section 2772(f) of

DIVISION 11 - PUBLIC FACILITIES FINANCING 
Chapters: 


CHAPTER 1 - DRAINAGE FACILITIES FINANCING 
Sections: 


811.0101 - Intent. 
The intent of this chapter is to require the payment of drainage fees for most new construction that is 
within an adopted Local Area Drainage Plan. Such fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of building 
permits for the purposes of defraying the actual or estimated costs of constructing planned drainage 
facilities. The authority for this Chapter is derived from the power granted to local governments by the 
Constitution of the State of California to preserve the public health, safety and general welfare. 


811.0105 - Establishment of Area Drainage Plans. 
(a) ?The provisions of this Chapter shall only affect those unincorporated portions of the County that are 
within the boundaries of an adopted Area Drainage Plan. 
(b) ?The Board of Supervisors in adopting an Area Drainage Plan shall find and determine that 
development or redevelopment of the property in the Plan Area will require the construction of the 
facilities described in the Plan Area and that the drainage fees are fairly apportioned within the 
drainage area. 
(c) ?The drainage fees shall be fairly apportioned based on one of the following: 1) on the basis of 
benefits conferred on property proposed to be developed or redeveloped, 2) on the need for 
drainage facilities created by such development and the development of other property in the 
drainage area, or 3) on the basis of the proportionate storm water run-off from each parcel. Fees to 
be paid shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total actual or estimated costs of all 
facilities within such area which would be assessable on such property if such costs were 
apportioned uniformly on a per acre basis. 
(d) ?The Board of Supervisors, in adopting or amending the Area Drainage Plan, shall do all of the 
following: 
(1) ?Identify the purpose of the fee. 
(2) ?Identify the use to which the fee is to be put. If the use is financing public facilities, then the 
facilities should be identified. The facilities may be identified by reference to any public 
document which identifies the facilities for which the fee is charged. 
(3) ?Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the type of 
development project on which the fee is imposed. 
(4) ?Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facility and 
the type of development project on which the fee is imposed. 
(5) ?Determine how there is a relationship between the amount of the fees and the cost of the flood 
control facilities, or portion thereof, attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed. 
(e) ?Area Drainage Plans and/or the drainage fee may be adopted by the Board, and thereafter 
amended at any time, only after holding a public hearing. The requirements of Government Code 
Section 66004 shall be followed prior to holding a public hearing establishing or modifying a fee for 
an Area Drainage Plan. 


811.0110 - Fee Collection and Accounting. 
(a) ?Except as otherwise provided in Section 811.0120(c), whenever a building permit, grading permit, or 
other County approval in connection with new construction is requested within the boundaries of an 
Area Drainage Plan, the specified drainage fee shall be deposited to the appropriate Planned 
Drainage Facilities Fund. Any interest income earned by the money in the fund shall also be 
deposited in the fund. The amount of the drainage fee shall be specified within the schedule of fees 
for each Area Drainage Plan. The established fee shall be paid to the County prior to the issuance of 
building permits, grading permits, or other County approvals in connection with new construction. 
(b) ?Drainage fees required by this chapter shall be paid to the County and deposited into a Drainage 
Facilities Fund. A separate fund shall be established for each Drainage Area. Monies in such funds 
shall be expended solely for the construction and reimbursement for the construction of drainage 
facilities, including related administration expenses, within the area from which the fees comprising 
the fund were collected, and/or to reimburse the local agency for the cost of engineering, right of way 
acquisition and administrative services required to design and construct facilities within the Area 
Drainage Plan. 
(c) ?Money may be advanced by a local agency to design and construct drainage facilities, related 
administrative services or to acquire necessary right-of-way within the area of an adopted Area 
Drainage Plan. Money so advanced shall be reimbursed to the local agency from the appropriate 
Planned Drainage Facilities Fund. 


811.0115 - Drainage Fee Calculation. 
(a) ?Fees assessed at the time of the issuance of a building permit, grading permit or other County 
approval related to new construction shall be based upon the total area of the parcel provided said 
parcel has a net area of less than one (1) acre. 
(b) ?Fees assessed at the time a building permit, grading permit or other County approval related to new 
construction is issued on a parcel which has a net area of one (1) acre or more shall be based on: 
The area of the developed portion of the parcel or one (1) acre, whichever is greater. As used in this 
chapter, the phrase "area of developed portion of the parcel" means the area of that portion of the 
parcel lying within a single rectangle which encloses all improvements, landscaped areas, storage 
areas and parking areas; plus the area of all improvements related to the required access that are 
outside the area of the described rectangle. 
(c) ?The amount of fees assessed and the area on which said fee is based shall be determined by the 
Building Official. The Building Official may require an applicant to submit all information necessary to 
calculate said fee(s). 


811.0120 - Credit and Exceptions. 
(a) ?(1) ?When required for the implementation of an adopted Area Drainage Plan, an agreement may 
be entered into between a developer and the County whereby the developer may advance 
money for the construction of facilities, or design of such facilities within an Area Drainage Plan. 
Subject to the restrictions in subsection (a) (2), the sole security to the developer for repayment 
of money or other consideration advanced shall be money subsequently accruing in the 
appropriate Planned Drainage Facilities Fund. Reimbursement shall be for the amount agreed 
upon in advance only and shall not include interest or other charges. The agreement shall 
expire fifteen years after the date it was entered into, and any subsequent money paid into the 
fund shall accrue to the fund without obligation to a developer whose agreement has expired. 
(2) ?The County may designate that up to twenty- five percent (25%) of the funds collected in a 
Planned Drainage Facilities Fund be utilized for reimbursement for any agreement entered into 
pursuant to subsection (a) (1). Other than the amount so designated by the County, Planned 
Drainage Facilities Funds shall not be used as reimbursement for any agreements authorized 
by subsection (a) (1). 
(b) ?An agreement may be entered into between a developer and the County whereby considerations 
such as dedication of right-of-way, actual construction, or design work by a civil engineer may be 
accepted in lieu of part or all of the payment of drainage fees, the Board of Supervisors shall find that 
the alternative is acceptable and is equal to or greater in value than the required fee, prior to 
approving such an agreement. 
(c) ?Drainage fees shall not be required as a condition of building permits on existing developed parcels 
for: 
(1) ?Maintenance and repair of existing improvements. 
(2) ?Reconstruction, when permits are issued within two years of the destruction of a structure due 
to fire, vandalism, wind, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters. 
(3) ?Construction of garages, carports, storage buildings, patio covers, swimming pools, and similar 
structures, accessory to a single-family residence. 
(4) ?Other construction or reconstruction which does not involve grading causing an increased rate 
of runoff when such construction or reconstruction falls within the boundaries of the rectangle 
described in Section 811.0115 as the "area of the developed portion of the parcel," as it existed 
prior to the effective date of an applicable area drainage plan. Applicant shall be responsible for 
providing sufficient information to establish that the proposed grading would not increase the 
rate of runoff. Assessment of fees due to such grading shall apply to only the portion of the 
parcel on which grading would contribute to an increased rate of runoff. 
(d) ?If a drainage fee for a parcel, or portion thereof, has been previously paid, credit shall be given for 
such prior payment toward any fee payment required by this chapter. 
(e) ?The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to property subject to other assessments for 
the same drainage facilities. 


811.0125. - Surplus and Refunds. 
(a) ?After completion of facilities and the payment of all claims from any planned Drainage Facilities 
Fund, the Board of Supervisors shall determine by resolution or other legislative action the amount of 
the surplus, if any, remaining in any of these funds. Any surplus shall be used, in those amounts as 
the Board may determine, for one or more of the following purposes: 
(1) ?For transfer to the General Fund of the County, provided that the amount of the transfer shall 
not exceed five percent (5%) of the total amount expended from the particular fund, and 
provided that the funds transferred are used to support the operation and maintenance of those 
facilities for which the fees were collected. 
(2) ?For the construction of additional or modified facilities within the same Area Drainage Plan. 
(3) ?As a refund in the manner provided in subsection (b), below. 
(b) ?Any surplus remaining shall be refunded as follows: 
(1) ?There shall be refunded to the current owners of property for which a fee was previously 
collected, the balance of such monies in the same proportion which each individual fee 
collected bears to the total of all individual fees collected from the particular drainage area; 
(2) ?Where property for which a fee was previously collected has subsequently been subdivided 
into more than one lot, each current owner of a lot shall share in the refund payable to the 
owners of the property for which a fee was previously collected in the same proportion which 
the area of each individual lot bears to the total area of the property for which a fee was 
previously collected; and 
(3) ?There shall be transferred to the general fund of the County any remaining portion of the 
surplus which has not been paid to or claimed by the persons entitled thereto within two years 
from the date either of the completion of the improvements, or the adoption by the Board of 
Supervisors of a resolution declaring a surplus, whichever is later to occur. 
(c) ?Subject to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above, commencing on the fifth year after 
imposition of a fee for an Area Drainage Plan and annually thereafter, the Board shall hold a hearing 
with respect to any portion of the fee remaining unexpended or uncommitted five or more years, and 
shall refund to the then owners of lots or units in development projects within the Area Drainage Plan 
on a pro rata basis any such unexpended or uncommitted fees plus interest accrued thereon, for 
which the Board is unable to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the need for the fee 
and the purpose for which it was charged. When applicable, refunds shall be made in accordance 
with Government Code Section 66001. 


811.0130 - Subject Areas. 
The provisions of this Chapter shall be applied only to areas within the boundaries of Local Area Drainage 
Plans that have been adopted by the Board of Supervisors, and shall have no force or effect in any other 
portion of the County. The rules, regulations, fees and plan areas are contained in the associated texts of 
each Area Drainage Plan. 


CHAPTER 2 - TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES FINANCING 
Sections: 


811.0201 - Intent. 
The intent of this chapter is to require the payment of transportation facilities fees for new development 
that is within the boundaries of an adopted Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan. Such fees shall be 
for the purposes of defraying the actual or estimated costs of constructing transportation facilities that are 
necessary to accommodate vehicular traffic generated by new development within the Local Area 
Transportation Facilities Plan from which such fees are collected. The authority for this chapter is derived 
from the power granted to local governments by the Constitution of the State of California to preserve the 
public health, safety and general welfare. 


811.0205 - Establishment Of Local Area Transportation Facilities Plans. 
(a) ?The provisions of this chapter shall only effect those unincorporated portions of the County that are 
within the boundaries of an adopted Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan. 
(b) ?The Board of Supervisors, in adopting or amending a Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan, 
shall do all of the following:

provided with the fees. 
(3) ?Determine that a reasonable relationship exists between the fee's use and the type of 
development project on which the fee is imposed. 
(4) ?Determine that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for the transportation 
facilities and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed. 
(5) ?Determine that a relationship exists between the amount of the fee and the cost of the 
Transportation Facility, or portion thereof, attributable to the development on which the fee is 
imposed. 
(c) ?The transportation facilities which constitute major thoroughfares as set forth in California 
Government Code Section 66484 and the railways, freeways, streams or canyons for which bridges 
are required, shall be identified in the circulation, transportation or flood control element of the 
County General Plan in the area of Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan at least 30 days prior to 
implementation of a fee for such facilities. Major thoroughfares shall be in addition to, or a 
reconstruction of, existing major thoroughfares, and bridges shall be original bridges or additions to 
existing bridges. 
(d) ?Local Area Transportation Facilities Plans and/or the transportation facilities fee may be adopted by 
the Board, and thereafter amended at any time, only after holding a public hearing. The requirements 
of California Government Code Section 66004 shall be followed prior to holding a public hearing 
establishing or increasing a fee for transportation facilities, and, if major thoroughfares or bridges are 
included, the provisions of California Government Code Section 66484 shall also be followed. 
(e) ?A public hearing concerning fees to construct major thoroughfares or bridges is subject to protest by 
the owners of property within the Plan area. If, prior to the conclusion of such a public hearing, there 
is a written protest, filed with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors, by the owners of more than one-
half of the area of the property to be benefited by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not 
withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented to less than one-half of that to be benefited, then the 
proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the Board of Supervisors shall not, for the one year 
from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same 
improvement or acquisition under the provisions of Section 66484 of the California Government 
Code.

within the boundaries of a Local Transportation Facilities Plan, provided that the sole security to the 
developer for repayment of money or other consideration advanced shall be money subsequently 
accruing in the applicable Local Transportation Facilities Fund. Reimbur-sement shall only be for the 
amount agreed upon in advance, and shall not include interest or other charges. The total amount of 
money reimbursed within a Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan for one fiscal year shall not 
exceed approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the fees collected within such plan area during 
the same fiscal year, except as may otherwise be provided in the applicable Local Area 
Transportation Facilities Plan. The agreement shall expire twenty (20) years after the date it was 
entered into, and any subsequent money paid into the fund shall accrue to the fund without 
obligation to the developer whose agreement has expired. 
(b) ?AGREEMENTS FOR CONSIDERATION IN-LIEU OF FEES 
An agreement may be entered into between a developer and the County whereby considerations 
such as dedication of land, right-of-way, equipment, facilities, actual construction, or design work by 
a civil engineer may be accepted in-lieu of part or all of the payment of transportation facilities fees. 
Prior to approving such an agreement, the Board of Supervisors shall find that the in-lieu 
consideration is equal to or greater in value than the required fee. 


811.0230 - Exclusions. 
(a) ?Intent 
The intent of this section is to exclude from the payment of transportation facilities fees the 
replacement of structures or uses with new structures or uses, that generate the same or a lesser 
amount of vehicular traffic than those being replaced on the same parcel, including: 
(1) ?Legally established existing structures, or uses in operation (including mobilehome parks), on 
the effective date of the applicable Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan. Expansion of such 
structures or uses shall be subject to such fees. 
(2) ?Replacements of structures or uses for which fees have been paid pursuant to this Chapter 
where such replaced structure or use generates the same or less traffic as the structure or use 
for which the fees were originally paid. 
(b) ?Residential Exclusions 
No transportation facilities fees shall be required for residential building permits or residential 
mobilehome setdown permits for the following: 
(1) ?Alterations, repairs, and construction of garages, carports, accessory storage buildings, patio 
covers, swimming pools, spas, boundary or decorative fences, amateur radio devices or earth 
stations or any other residential accessory structures. 
(2) ?Replacement of a legally established residential dwelling unit, including a unit destroyed or 
damaged by fire, flood, or other accidents or catastrophe provided that: 
(A) ?Such a replacement will not result in an increase in the number of residential dwelling 
units, and; 
(B) ?The proposed type of residential dwelling unit (i.e., single family, multi family, 
mobilehome, etc.) is within a fee category, as identified in the applicable Local Area 
Transportation Facilities Plan, for which the per-dwelling unit fee amount is less than or 
equal to the per-dwelling unit amount of the fee category for the dwelling unit to be 
replaced. If the proposed type of residential dwelling unit is within a fee category for which 
the fee amount is greater than the amount of the fee category for the dwelling unit being 
replaced, the amount of the fee required shall be the difference between the two fee 
categories. 
(c) ?Non-Residential Exclusions 
No transportation facilities fees shall be required for non-residential uses or buildings for the 
following activities: 
(1) ?Alterations and Repairs. 
(2) ?Replacement of non-residential structures or uses if: 
(A) ?New or replacement construction will not increase the area or square footage upon which 
fees are assessed as prescribed in the applicable Local Area Transportation Facilities 
Plan; and 
(B) ?The proposed type of structure or use is within a fee category (as identified in the 
applicable Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan) that has a fee amount that is less than 
or equal to the amount of the fee category for the structure or use to be replaced. If the 
proposed type of structure or use is within a fee category that has a fee amount that is 
greater than the amount of the fee category for the structure or use being replaced, the 
amount of the fee required shall be the difference between the two fee categories. 
(d) ?Relationship To Other Transportation Facilities Assessments 
The provisions of this Chapter shall not be applicable to property subject to other assessments which 
wholly provide for the same transportation facilities as the applicable Local Transportation Facilities 
Plan. Where such assessments partially provide for such facilities the fees or in lieu considerations 
required through the Local Area Transportation Facilities Plan shall be imposed at a level that only 
reflects the additional costs of providing the facilities. 


811.0235 - Surplus And Refunds. 
(a) ?Commencing on the seventh year after impositions of a fee for a Local Area Transportation 
Facilities Plan and annually thereafter, the Board shall hold a hearing with respect to any portion of

owners of lots or units in development projects within the Plan areas on a prorata basis any such 
unexpended or uncommitted fees plus interest accrued thereon, for which the Board is unable to 
demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the need for the fee and the purpose for which it was 
charged. Refunds shall be made in accordance with California Government Code Section 66001. 
(b) ?After completion of facilities and the payment of all claims from any Local Transportation Facilities 
Fund, the Board shall determine by resolution or other legislative action the amount of the surplus 
monies, if any, remaining in any of these funds. Any surplus shall be refunded in accordance with 
California Government Code Section 66001.

CHAPTER 3 - RECREATIONAL FACILITIES FINANCING 
Sections: 


811.0301 - Intent and General Provisions. 
The intent of this chapter is to provide for the development of park and recreational facilities, through 
subdivision regulations, in an area where the need for parks has been expressed by the community, and 
a public agency exists to administer these facilities. Each subdivider of land for residential use shall, as a 
condition to the approval of a parcel map or final subdivision map, dedicate lands or pay fees in lieu 
thereof, or a combination of both, for park or recreational purposes. Dedication and fee requirements shall 
be conveyed to the designated public agency or into a special County fund established for this purpose, 
prior to approval of the final map or parcel map. 


811.0305 - Jurisdiction Limitations. 
The requirement for dedication of land or payment of fees shall be contingent upon a Board of 
Supervisors' resolution adopting at public hearing said requirements and procedures for a community 
area. Said area shall be served by a public agency legally empowered to improve, maintain and operate 
the dedicated land consistent with the General Plan. 


811.0310 - Requirements. 
Land or fees required under this Chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the County or the public 
agency, in accepting such land or funds, shall develop the land or use the funds as herein provided: 
(a) ?Use of Land and Fees. The land, fees or combination thereof are to be used only for the 
purpose of providing park or recreational facilities within the agency which will serve or benefit 
future residents of such subdivision. 
(b) ?Establishment and Development Time. The Board of Supervisors, in agreement with the public 
agency having park responsibility, shall specify by resolution at the time approval is given to the 
final map when the development of a park or recreation facility to serve the subject subdivision 
will begin. The starting date shall be reasonable with respect to: (1) the need for such park or 
facility, (2) weather constraints, (3) minimized disruption of the neighborhood, and (4) the 
accumulation of the necessary funds and land. 
(c) ?Land Disposition. In the event that opportunities for better recreation facilities than those 
provided by the dedication materialize, the land so dedicated may be sold with the proceeds 
therefrom being used for suitable park and recreation facilities which serve the neighborhood in 
which that subdivision is located. 
(d) ?Only the payment of fees shall be required in subdivisions of less than fifty (50) lots unless 
agreed otherwise by the Board of Supervisors and the subdivider. 
(e) ?Standards for Dedication. The amount of land to be dedicated or the fees to be paid shall bear 
a reasonable relationship to the use or benefits of the park and recreation facilities by the future 
residents of the subdivision. The Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the 
designated public agency with park powers, shall set by resolution the ratio of park acres to one 
thousand (1,000) population. The said ratio may be set to maintain the existing level of park 
acres per one thousand (1,000) population served by the public agency. 
(f) ?Amount of Park Fees Required. When the requirements of this chapter are complied with solely 
on the basis of providing park fees, the minimum amount of fees to be paid shall be computed 
by using the following formula:

(g) ?Amount of Land Required. Whenever the requirements of this chapter are complied with solely 
on the basis of providing park land, the minimum amount of land required shall be the amount 
which could be purchased with the fees computed in Subsection 811.0310(f). 
(h) ?Park and Recreational Use LandFair Market Value. The fair market value shall be 
determined as of the date of filing of the parcel map or final map in accordance with the 
following: 
(1) ?The fair market value as determined by the Board of Supervisors based upon the market 
value of the land as a part of the subdivision, not as raw acreage, in accordance with the 
current practice of the County Assessor; or 
(2) ?If the subdivider objects to such evaluation, he may, at his own expense, obtain an 
appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser from the general area, 
approved by the County, which appraisal may be accepted by the Board of Supervisors if 
found reasonable; or 
(3) ?The County and subdivider may agree to the fair market value. 
(i) ?Combination of Park Land and Fees Required. When only a portion of the required park land is 
dedicated as required in Subsection 811.0310(g), a fee computed pursuant to Subsection 
811.0310(f) shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 


811.0315 - Procedure. 
The requirements of this Chapter shall be complied with prior to the approval of the final map or parcel 
map by the provision of park land in whole or in part, the payment of a park fee, or by a combination of 
both as required by the Advisory Agency. 
(a) ?Subdivider. At the time of filing a tentative map, parcel map or minor subdivision plot plan for 
approval, the subdivider shall, as part of such filing, state in writing whether it is desired to 
dedicate property for park and recreational purposes or to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If the 
subdivider desires to dedicate land for this purpose, the area shall be designated on the 
tentative tract or parcel map as submitted. 
(b) ?Action of County. At the time of the tentative tract map approval, the Advisory Agency shall 
determine as part of such approval, whether to require a dedication of the land within the 
subdivision, payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of both. 
(c) ?Prerequisites for Approval of Final Maps. Where dedication is offered and accepted, it shall be 
accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. Where fees are 
required, the same shall be deposited with the County or Local agency prior to the approval of 
the final tract map. 
(d) ?Determination. The Advisory Agency shall determine whether to require land dedication, 
require payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of both, by consideration of the 
following: 
(1) ?Recreational element of the General Plan; and 
(2) ?Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for 
dedication; and 
(3) ?Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; and 
(4) ?Desires and plans of the public agency which will provide the services. 
(e) ?Park and Recreational Areas where required shall be developed in conjunction with any 
pedestrian, bikeway and equestrian linkage ways and in accordance with the County 
Conservation and Open Space policies and any applicable community or specific plans. 
(f) ?Park and Recreational Use LandCredit for Private Open Space. Where private open space 
for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to 
be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, such areas shall 
be credited up to seventy-five percent (75%) against the requirement of a dedication for park 
and recreation purposes, as set forth in Subsection 811.0310(g), or the payment of fees in lieu 
thereof, as set forth in Subsection 811.0310(f), provided the Advisory Agency finds it is in the 
public interest to do so, and that the following standards are met: 
(1) ?That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the 
zoning, land use district, and building regulations shall not be included in the computation 
of such private open space; and 
(2) ?That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for 
by written agreement; and 
(3) ?That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by 
recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of the property 
within the tract; and 
(4) ?That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and 
recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, 
geology, access and location of the private open space land; and 
(5) ?That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the 
provisions of the General Plan, and are approved by the Planning Commission. 


811.0320 - Exemptions. 
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to industrial subdivisions; nor do they apply to condominium 
projects which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than 
five (5) years old, when no new dwelling units are added; nor do they apply to parcel maps for a 
subdivision containing less than five (5) parcels for a shopping center containing more than three hundred 
thousand (300,000) square feet of gross leasable area and no residential development or uses. 
Subdivisions containing less than five (5) parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempt 
from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval 
of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or 
structures on one or more of the parcels within four (4) years, the fee shall be required to be paid by the 
owner of each such parcel as a condition of the issuance of such permit.
