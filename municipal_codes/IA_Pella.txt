A violation of this Code of Ordinances or any ordinance or code herein
adopted by reference or the omission or failure to perform any act or duty
required by the same, with the exception of those provisions specifically
provided under State law as a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
misdemeanor, or a simple misdemeanor under Chapters 687 through 747 of the
Code of Iowa, is a municipal infraction punishable by civil penalty as
provided herein.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[3])



4.02  PENALTIES.



A municipal infraction is punishable by civil penalties as contained in the
Schedule of Rates and Fees in Chapter 171 of this Code of Ordinances.

Any officer authorized by the City to enforce this Code of Ordinances may
issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal infraction.  The
citation may be served by personal service as provided in Iowa Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.305, by certified mail addressed to the defendant at defendant's
last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by publication in
the manner as provided in Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.310 and subject to
the conditions of Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.311.  A copy of the
citation shall be retained by the issuing officer, one copy shall be sent to
the Clerk of the District Court, and one copy shall be sent to the County
Treasurer.  The citation shall serve as notification that a civil offense
has been committed and shall contain the following information:

Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this chapter does not preclude the
City from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same action. 
Such relief may include the imposition of a civil penalty by entry of a
personal judgment against the defendant, directing that the payment of the
civil penalty be suspended or deferred under conditions imposed by the court,
ordering the defendant to abate or cease the violation or authorizing the
City to abate or correct the violation, or ordering that the City’s cost
for abatement or correction of the violation be entered as a personal
judgment against the defendant or assessed against the property where the
violation occurred, or both.  If a defendant willfully violates the terms of
an order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.



4.05  CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

38.02  DEFINITIONS.



For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:



1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove or dispose of a
hazardous substance.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])



2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.   



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])



3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of
substances that presents a danger to the public health or safety and
includes, but is not limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or
flammable, or that is an irritant or that generates pressure through
decomposition, heat, or other means.  “Hazardous substance” may include

States Environmental Protection Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as
amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic
pollutant listed under section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act

substance or is operating under a lease, contract, or other agreement with
the legal owner of the hazardous substance.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])



38.03  CLEANUP REQUIRED.



Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the
environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,
including ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to
be remedied by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as
feasible to an acceptable, safe condition.  The costs of cleanup shall be
borne by the responsible person.  If the responsible person does not cause
the cleanup to begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and
circumstances of the incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give
reasonable notice, based on the character of the hazardous condition, said
notice setting a deadline for accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the
City will proceed to procure cleanup services and bill the responsible person
for all costs associated with the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished
within the deadline.  In the event that it is determined that immediate
cleanup is necessary as a result of the present danger to the public health,
safety and welfare, then no notice shall be required and the City may proceed
to procure the cleanup and bill the responsible person for all costs
associated with the cleanup.  If the bill for those services is not paid
within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall proceed to obtain payment by
all legal means.  If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the capacity of the

in a hazardous condition.



2.   The reasonable costs incurred by the City to evacuate people from the
area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the person.



3.   The reasonable damages to the City for the injury to, destruction of,
or loss of City property, including parks and roads, resulting from a
hazardous condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing
the injury, destruction or loss.



38.05  NOTIFICATIONS.



1.   A person manufacturing, storing, handling, transporting, or disposing
of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural
Resources and the Police Chief or Police Department of the occurrence of a
hazardous condition as soon as possible but not later than six (6) hours
after the onset of the hazardous condition or discovery of the hazardous
condition.  The Police Chief shall immediately notify the Department of
Natural Resources.

by a school district or accredited nonpublic school, or is an area education
agency staff member who provides services to a school or school district, and
intervenes in a fight or physical struggle, or other disruptive situation
that takes place in the presence of the employee or staff member performing
employment duties in a school building, on school grounds or at an official
school function regardless of the location, the act is not an assault,
whether the fight or physical struggle or other disruptive situation is
between students or other individuals if the degree and the force of the
intervention is reasonably necessary to restore order and to protect the
safety of those assembled.

3.   Disrupt Lawful Assembly.  Without lawful authority or color of

46.02  Cigarettes and Tobacco
 



 



46.01  CURFEW.



The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper
influences and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the
curfew hour.



1.   Definitions.  For use in this section, the following terms are
defined:



   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand
relating to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other
situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily
injury or loss of life.



   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor
in that responsible adult’s custody.  This is an objective standard.  It
is therefore no defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of the minor.



   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of
sixteen (16) years.



   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked

designed, set aside or used as a secure detention area, and the person
arrested is not physically secured during the period of custody in the area;
the person is physically accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person
employed by the facility where the person arrested is being held; and the use
of the area is limited to providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting
transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of
and release to the person’s parents or other responsible adult or for other
administrative purposes; but not for longer than six (6) hours without the
oral or written order of a judge or magistrate authorizing the detention.  A
judge shall not extend the period of time in excess of six hours beyond the
initial six-hour period.



   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks,
playgrounds, streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also
includes such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or
privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general
public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the
general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the
general public has access.  For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other
conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.



   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.



   G.   “Unemancipated” means unmarried and/or still under the
custody or control of a responsible adult.



2.   Curfew Established.  It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain
upon any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of
business and amusement in the City between the hours of ten o’clock (10:00)
p.m. and five o’clock (5:00) a.m. of the following day on days commencing
on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and between the hours of
twelve o’clock (12:00) midnight and five o’clock (5:00) a.m. on Friday
and Saturday.



3.   Exceptions.  The following are exceptions to the curfew:



   A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.



   B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor
resides or on either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult
responsible for the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.



   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of
the following:



      (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or
occupation in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if
traveling, within one hour after the end of work;



      (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling,
within one hour after the end of the religious activity;



      (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling,
within one hour after the end of the activity;



      (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after
the end of the activity.



   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult.



   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.



   F.   The minor’s business, trade or occupation, in which the minor
is permitted by law to be engaged, requires the presence of the minor in the
public place.



4.   Responsibility of Adults.  It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s
presence falls within one of the above exceptions.



5.   Enforcement Procedures.



   A.   Determination of Age.  In determining the age of the juvenile
and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or
driver’s license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the
first instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age.



   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody.  Grounds for arrest
are that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification;
persists in violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification
or to identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the
person’s own safety or to the safety of the public.  A law enforcement
officer who arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in
custody either in a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. 
The officer shall not place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the
minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical violence when
being taken into custody.  A minor shall not be placed in detention
following a curfew violation.



   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult.  After a minor is taken
into custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible
for the minor as soon as possible.  The minor shall be released to the adult
responsible for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the
child in court at such time as the court may direct.



   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision.  If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other
person legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable
time, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an
adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or
another adult person who is known to the child.



46.02  CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.



It is unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of age to smoke, use,
possess, purchase or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products or
cigarettes.  Possession of cigarettes or tobacco products by a person under
eighteen years of age shall not constitute a violation of this section if
said person possesses the cigarettes or tobacco products as part of the
person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa and lawfully offers for
sale or sells cigarettes or tobacco products.

50.09    REQUEST FOR HEARING AND APPEAL.



Any person ordered to abate a nuisance or condition may have a hearing with
the officer ordering the abatement as to whether a nuisance or prohibited
condition exists.  A request for a hearing must be made in writing and
delivered to the officer ordering the abatement within the time stated in the
notice, or it will be conclusively presumed that a nuisance or prohibited
condition exists and it must be abated as ordered.  At the conclusion of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall render a written decision as to whether a
nuisance or prohibited condition exists.  If the officer finds that a
nuisance or prohibited condition exists, such officer must order it abated
with an additional time which must be reasonable under the circumstances. 
An appeal from this decision may be had by immediately filing a written
notice with the hearing officer.  This appeal will be heard before the
Council at a time and place fixed by the Council, which shall be
reasonable.  The findings of the council shall be conclusive and, if a
nuisance or prohibited condition is found to exist, it shall be ordered
abated within a time reasonable under the circumstances.



50.10  ABATEMENT IN EMERGENCY.



If it is determined that an emergency exists by reason of the continuing
maintenance of the nuisance or condition, the City may perform any action
which may be required under this chapter without prior notice.  The City
shall assess the costs as provided herein after notice to the property owner
under the applicable provisions of Sections 50.06, 50.07 and 50.08 and

50.11  ABATEMENT BY CITY.



If the person notified to abate a nuisance or condition neglects or fails to
abate as directed, the City may perform the required action to abate, keeping
an accurate account of the expense incurred.  The itemized expense account
shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall pay such expenses on behalf of the
City.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])



50.12  COLLECTION OF COSTS.



The Clerk shall mail a statement of the total expense incurred by certified
mail to the property owner who has failed to abide by the notice to abate,
and if the amount shown by the statement has not been paid within thirty (30)
days, the Clerk shall certify the costs to the County Treasurer and such
costs shall then be collected with, and in the same manner, as general
property taxes.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])



50.13  REMEDY BY BRINGING SUIT.



Upon complaint and investigation, the Council may, by resolution, direct the
Mayor to bring suit to abate a nuisance in the proper court.



1.   Process.  When, upon indictment, complaint or civil action, any
person is found guilty of erecting, causing or continuing a nuisance or other
prohibited condition, the court before whom such finding is had may order, in
addition to the judgment for damages or costs for which a separate execution
may be issued, that such nuisance or condition be abated or removed at the
expense of the defendant, and after inquiry into and estimating as nearly as
may be the sum necessary to defray the expenses of such abatement, the court
may issue a warrant therefor.



2.   Stay of Execution.  Instead of issuing such warrant, the court may
order the same to be stayed upon motion of the defendant, and upon his or her
entering into an undertaking to the City in such sum and with such surety as
the court may direct, conditioned either that the defendant will discontinue
said nuisance or condition or that, within a time limited by the court and
not exceeding six (6) months, he or she will cause the same to be abated and
removed, as either is directed by the court; and upon failure to perform the
condition of such undertaking, the same shall be forfeited, and the court,
upon being satisfied of such default, may order such warrant forthwith to
issue, and action may be brought on such undertaking.



3.   Expenses Collected.  The expense of abating a nuisance or condition
by virtue of a warrant can be collected by the officer in the same manner as
damages and costs are collected on execution, except that the materials of
any buildings, fences or other things that may be removed as a nuisance or
condition may be first levied upon and sold by the officer, and if any of the
proceeds remain after satisfying the expense of the removal, such balance
must be paid by the officer to the defendant, or to the owner of the property
levied upon; and if said proceeds are not sufficient to pay such expenses,
the officer must collect the remainder.



50.14  INSTALLMENT PAYMENT OF COST OF ABATEMENT.



If the amount expended to abate the nuisance or condition exceeds one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the City may permit the assessment to be paid in up to ten
(10) annual installments, to be paid in the same manner and with the same
interest rates provided for assessments against benefited property under
State law.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.13)



50.15  FAILURE TO ABATE.



Any person causing or maintaining a nuisance who shall fail or refuse to
abate or remove the same within the reasonable time required and specified in
the notice to abate is in violation of this Code of Ordinances.

1.   Intent and Purpose.  The Pella City Council finds and declares that
the provisions of this section are enacted for the following reasons:



   A.   To protect the residents of these residential districts from
unreasonable burden in gaining access to their residences



   B.   To preserve the character of these districts as residential
districts



   C.   To preserve the value of the property in these residential
districts



   D.   To promote traffic safety, the safety of children, and the
safety of pedestrians in these residential districts.



2.   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following terms
shall have the meanings listed below:



   A.   "Block face" shall refer to all the properties on one side of a
given street existing between two consecutive intersection streets.



   B.   "Dwelling unit" shall mean a building or portion of a building
which is exclusively arranged, occupied, or intended to be occupied as living
quarters for one family, but not including dwelling units in hotels,
institutions, dormitories, or convalescent or nursing homes.



   C.   "Motor vehicle" shall mean a vehicle licensed as a private
passenger car, or a motorcycle, or light pickup truck, but not including any
other truck or road tractor.



   D.   "Resident" shall mean a person who maintains a bona fide

   E.   "Residential district" shall mean a contiguous area containing
public streets or parts thereof abutted by residential property, or

   F.   "Residential parking permit district" shall mean a residential
area designated by ordinance as herein provided.



3.   Residential Parking Permit Program Established.  There is hereby
established a residential parking permit program.  The procedure for being
designated a residential parking permit district shall be as follows:



   A.   Petition.  In order to be considered for a residential parking
permit district designation, a group of residents must submit a petition to
the City Administrator containing the signature of an adult member of at
least 60% of the dwelling units in the residential area.  Petitions shall
only be considered for areas which contain at least two adjacent block faces
or 20 curb parking spaces.  The boundaries of, and the streets within the
proposed permit parking district, shall be clearly identified on each page of
the petition.  The petition shall also state clearly that if the district is
approved, participation in the program is mandatory; only those vehicles with
a permit shall be permitted to park in the residential parking permit
district daily, except Sundays and holidays.  The necessary petition can be
obtained from the office of the City Clerk.  A cover letter explaining the
reasons for the request and a map showing the boundaries of the proposed
parking permit district shall accompany the petition.



   B.   Exception.  A petition may be considered for an area which
contains less than two adjacent block faces or 20 curb parking spaces if
there are extenuating conditions that render such requirement unreasonable. 
Upon the recommendation of the City Administrator, such requirement may be
waived by the City Council if it finds that the proposed residential district
is isolated or separated from other residential areas by topographical
features or by commercial area.  The City Council shall not grant such a
waiver, however, if it determines that the only basis for granting such a
waiver is the convenience of the residents or if it determines that the
waiver is being requested by the petitioners to prevent opposition to
establishing a district.  All other requirements of this section must be
established.



   C.   Parking Study.  Upon receipt of a valid petition, the City
Administrator shall initiate a parking study of the area identified in the
petition to be conducted by the Public Works Department.  A residential
parking permit district may be established only if the results of the study
demonstrate that both of the following criteria are satisfied during peak
periods:



      (1)     At least 60% of the curbside parking spaces in the
proposed parking permit district were utilized during peak periods. For
purposes of the criterion, a legal curbside parking space shall be at least
20 linear feet.



      (2)     At least 25% of the curbside parking spaces in the
proposed parking district were utilized by nonresident parkers. For purposes
of the criterion, the latest available motor vehicle registration information
shall be used.



   D.   Parking Study Report and Recommendation.  Upon completion of
the parking study, the City Administrator shall make a report and
recommendation to the City Council on whether or not to designate the
proposed parking district, or a portion thereof, as a residential parking
permit district.  The recommendation shall take the following into account:



      (1)     The effect on the safety of the residents of the
proposed residential parking permit district from intensive parking by
nonresidents



      (2)     The difficulty or inability of residents of the
proposed residential parking permit district to obtain adequate curbside
parking adjacent to or near their residences because of widespread use of
available curbside parking spaces by nonresident motorists



      (3)     The likelihood of alleviating, by use of the
residential parking permit program, any problem of non-availability of
residential parking spaces and



      (4)     The desire of the residents in the proposed
residential parking permit area for the institution of a residential parking
permit district.



   E.   Public Hearing.  Upon receipt of the report and recommendation
from the City Administrator, the City Council shall set a public hearing on
the petition.  Upon completion of the public hearing, the City Council may
reject the petition or adopt an ordinance designating the permit area as a
residential parking permit district.



4.   Posting of Residential Parking Permit Signs.  Following the adoption
of an ordinance designating a residential parking permit district, signs
shall be erected in the designated area indicating parking is restricted
except Sundays and holidays, unless the vehicle properly displays a valid
parking permit.



5.   Notice to Residents of Designation of Residential Parking Permit
District.  Following adoption of an ordinance to designate a residential
parking permit district, the City Clerk shall mail to every dwelling unit
within the designated district the following documents:



   A.   A notice of designation which shall inform the residents in the
designated area of:



      (1)      The existence, exact location, and color
designation of the residential parking permit district



      (2)      The parking restrictions applicable to all vehicle
curbside parking spaces along streets in the designated area which do not
properly display a parking permit authorized by this section and



      (3)      The procedures to obtain a residential parking
permit.



   B.   An application for residential parking permit on which the
applicant is to provide the following information for each vehicle to receive
a residential parking permit:



      (1)     The name and residential address of the owner of the
vehicle



      (2)     The make, model, license plate number and
registration number of the vehicle



      (3)     The signature of the applicant for the residential
parking permit.



   C.   If a resident within a residential parking permit district does
not have a vehicle registered to them, a residential parking permit
application shall be completed to obtain visitor permits.



6.   Issuance of Residential Parking Permit.



   A.   A residential parking permit shall be issued upon submission of
a completed residential parking permit application. A separate application is
required for each motor vehicle the applicant parks curbside within the
district. Not more than two residential parking permits shall be issued to
each dwelling unit and not more than two guest parking permits shall be
issued for each dwelling unit.



   B.   The residential parking permit shall be permanently affixed to
the inside bottom left corner of the front windshield. Guest permits shall be
displayed in the same location. Vehicles not equipped with a front windshield

City Clerk's office during the month of August and expires on August 31 of
the following year.

application, the holder shall receive a new parking permit.



8.   Transfer of Residential Parking Permit.



   A.   Upon the submission of a completed residential parking permit
application and the surrender of the existing residential parking permit, the
permit holder shall receive a new residential parking permit to be
transferred to another qualifying vehicle.



   B.   The transfer of the residential parking permit to another
qualifying vehicle shall not affect its expiration date.



9.   Responsibility of Permit Holder.



   A.   The holder of a residential parking permit or guest parking
permit shall be permitted to stand or park a motor vehicle operated by such
holder in the designated residential parking permit district during such time
as the parking of such vehicles therein is permitted.  While such vehicle
for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked, or a
vehicle displaying a visitor permit, such permit shall be displayed as
prescribed in this section.



   B.   A residential parking permit or guest parking permit does not
guarantee or reserve the holder a parking space within the designated permit
parking district.  A parking permit does not authorize the standing or
parking of any vehicle in such places and during such times as the stopping,
standing or parking of vehicles is prohibited or set aside for specific types
of vehicles, and does not excuse the violation of any traffic regulation in
the residential parking district.



   C.   Whenever the holder of a residential or guest parking permit,
or the vehicle for which the parking permit was issued, no longer fulfills
one or more of the applicable provisions of this section controlling the
issuance, renewal or transfer of parking permits, the holder shall so notify
the City Clerk's office.



   D.   Until its expiration, surrender or revocation, a parking permit
shall remain valid for such time as the holder continues to reside within the
designated residential parking permit district.



   E.   A parking permit shall be valid only in the residential parking
permit district for which it is issued.  Parking permits for each district
will be distinct by color coding.



10.   Exceptions.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to
clearly marked service vehicles doing business in the designated residential
parking permit district during the time they are working in the district.



11.   Waiver of Residential Parking Permit Regulations.  Upon receipt of
an application for the waiver of the parking requirements of a residential
parking permit district, the City Council may temporarily suspend such
parking regulations by resolution.



12.   Withdrawal of Designation of Residential Permit District. 



   A.   Action to withdraw a residential parking permit district
designation may be made by a petition signed by adult members of at least 60%
of the dwelling units in the designated district.



   B.   Upon receipt of a valid petition, the City Council shall set a
public hearing on the question of withdrawing the residential parking permit
district designation.  Upon completion of the public hearing, the City
Council may repeal the ordinance designating the residential parking permit
district.



   C.   Following any repeal of the ordinance establishing a
residential parking permit district, the City Clerk shall notify each
resident within the district of such City Council action.



   D.   The effective date of withdrawal of the designation shall be
upon publication of the repealing ordinance.

during the restricted hours without displaying the proper permit.

parking permit authorized by this section when it is not so entitled.  The
display of a parking permit on a vehicle not entitled to such a parking
permit is prohibited.



   C.   Duplicate, or attempt to duplicate, by any means, a parking
permit authorized by this section.  It shall also be a violation of this
section to display upon any vehicle such a duplicate parking permit.

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property.  A police authority
taking into custody an abandoned vehicle which has been determined to create
a traffic hazard shall report the reasons constituting the hazard in writing
to the appropriate authority having duties of control of the highway.  The
police authority may employ its own personnel, equipment and facilities or

personal property within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the
owner, lienholders and claimants of all right, title, claim and interest in
the vehicle or personal property and that failure to reclaim the vehicle or
personal property is deemed consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public
auction or disposal of the vehicle to a demolisher and to disposal of the
personal property by sale or destruction. The notice shall state that any
person claiming rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who
disputes the planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police

circulation in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient
to meet all requirements of notice under Section 80.03.  The published
notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles and personal
property but shall be published within the same time requirements and contain
the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section 80.03.

motor vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without
notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two (2) or
more wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally
inoperable.  The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of
authority.  The applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a
junking certificate and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu

96.01  DEFINITIONS.



The definitions of Chapter 95 apply to this chapter.



96.02  PERMIT REQUIRED.



1.   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any hook-up with or
opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sanitary sewer or appurtenance
thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the City.



2.   There are two (2) classes of building sewer permits:  (i) for
residential and commercial service; and (ii) for service to establishments
producing industrial waste.  For both classes, the owner or agent shall make
application on a form provided by the City.  The permit application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered
pertinent in the judgment of the Director.



3.   The application for the permit shall set forth the location and
description of the property to be connected with the sanitary sewer system
and the purpose for which the sanitary sewer is to be used, and shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered
pertinent.  The permit shall require the owner to complete construction and
hook-up of the building sewer to the public sanitary sewer within sixty (60)
days after the issuance of the permit, except that when a property owner
makes sufficient showing that due to conditions beyond the owner’s control
or peculiar hardship, such time period is inequitable or unfair, an extension
of time within which to comply with the provisions herein may be granted. 
Any sanitary sewer hook-up permit may be revoked at any time for a violation
of these chapters.



96.03  PERMIT FEE AND SPECIAL FRONTAGE FEE.



The following fees will be charged for building sewer permits:



1.   Permit Fee.  Permit fees in the amounts prescribed in Chapter 171 of
this Code of Ordinances shall be charged.



2.   Special Frontage Fee.  If the property to be connected to a public
sanitary sewer has not been assessed for any part of the cost of construction
of the public sewers or has been assessed only as an unimproved lot, the
owner shall pay a special connection charge to the City for the use of the
public sanitary sewers before a building sewer permit is issued.  The amount
of this fee shall be an equitable portion of the cost of the public sanitary
sewer in relation to the benefits received by the property, and shall be
determined by the Director, subject to approval, modification, or revocation
by the City Council.  The equitable portion of said cost of the public
sanitary sewer in relation to benefits received is deemed to be not less than
the amount set out in Chapter 171 per front foot of the lot to be served
abutting on public streets.



96.04  EXCAVATIONS.



All excavations within the City right-of-way for the installation of a
building sewer shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
141, Excavations.



96.05  HOOK-UP REQUIREMENTS.



Any hook-up with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Director.  All costs and expenses incidental to the
installation and hook-up of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. 
The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly
or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.  In
addition to the criteria pursuant to the Design Standards, Standard
Specifications, and the Iowa State Plumbing Code, building sewers shall be
constructed in accordance with the following:



1.   Old Building Sewers.  Old building sewers may be used in hook-up
with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test
conducted by the owner and observed by the Director, to meet all requirements
of this chapter.



2.   Separate Building Sewers.  A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building
stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no on-site sanitary
sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an
adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway.  In such cases the building sewer
from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer.



3.   Installation.  All hook-ups shall be made gastight and watertight. 
Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved
by the Director before installation.



4.   Water Line Clearance.  When possible, building sewers should be laid
at least ten (10) feet horizontally from a water service.  The horizontal
separation may be less, provided the water service line is located at one
side and at least twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer.



5.   Alignments or grades different than required shall be made only with
the written approval of the Director and shall be made only with approved
fittings.



6.   Sewage Lifts.  In all buildings in which any building drain is too
low to permit gravity flow to the public sanitary sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer.



96.06  INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.



Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by restaurants,
food preparation facilities, gas and service stations, convenience stores,
car washes, garages, and other facilities when, in the opinion of the
Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of such wastes that
contain grease in excessive amounts or any flammable waste, sand or other
harmful ingredients.  Such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units.  When required, such interceptors shall
be installed and maintained in accordance with the Iowa State Plumbing
Code.  Every person discharging to the public sanitary sewer shall permit
the Director, at any reasonable time to have free access to any premises or
buildings, to inspect grease traps and grease interceptors to determine if
such items are installed and maintained in accordance with the Iowa State
Plumbing Code.



96.07  SEWER TAP.



Hook-up of the building sewer into the public sanitary sewer shall be made at
the wye branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.  If no
properly located wye branch is available, a saddle wye shall be installed at
the location specified by the Director.  The public sanitary sewer shall be
tapped with a tapping saddle appropriate to the type of public sanitary sewer
shall be glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the
sewer.  At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a
manhole unless special written permission is received from the Director. 



96.08  INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.



Hook-ups with the sanitary sewer system before being backfilled or covered
may be inspected by the Director.  As soon as all pipe work from the public
sanitary sewer to inside the building has been completed, and before any
backfilling is done, the Director shall be notified and the Director may
inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material.  If the Director
refuses to approve the work, the Director must identify the deficiencies, and
the permittee or property owner must proceed immediately to correct the
deficiencies.



96.09  PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.



All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner.  The owner
shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.



96.10  ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.



Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which
construction or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of
this chapter, shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within thirty
(30) days after date of official notice from the Council of such violation. 
If not made within such time the Council shall, in addition to the other
penalties herein provided, have the right to finish and correct the work and
assess the cost thereof to the property owner.  Such assessment shall be
collected with and in the same manner as general property taxes.

97.04  PROHIBITED DISCHARGES - POWERS.



If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sanitary sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in Section 97.03 and which in the judgment of
the Director may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Director may:



1.   Reject.  Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the
public sanitary sewer system.



2.   Require Pretreatment.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable
condition for discharge to the public sanitary sewers.



3.   Impose Controls.  Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge.



4.   Charge Additional Fees.  Require payment to cover the added cost of
handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sanitary
sewer charges under the provisions of Chapter 99.



5.   Require Characterization of the Wastewater.  In making a
determination for the activities listed above, the Director may require a
characterization of the proposed wastewater, including measurement, testing,
and analyses, in accordance with Director-approved methods.



97.05  SPECIAL FACILITIES.



If the Director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Director and subject to the requirements of all
applicable local, State and Federal regulations.  Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at said control manhole.  In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sanitary sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property.  (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken.  Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples.)

99.01  PURPOSE.



The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedures and regulations to
be followed in the calculation, establishment and collection of charges from
customers so that the City can pay for the operation and maintenance, as
herein defined, of the wastewater treatment system and for the public
sanitary sewer bond debt retirement for financing the public sanitary sewer
system improvements constructed under the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Project No. C190754.



99.02  DEFINITIONS.



The definitions of Chapter 95 apply to this chapter.  In addition, “normal
domestic sewage” means wastewater that has a BOD concentration of not more
than three hundred (300) mg/l and a suspended solids concentration of not
more than three hundred fifty (350) mg/l.



99.03  REQUIREMENTS.



The user charge system shall generate adequate annual revenues to pay costs
of (1) annual operation and maintenance including replacement, and (2) costs
associated with the public sanitary sewer bond debt retirement for financing
the wastewater treatment works which the City may, by resolution, designate
to be paid by the user charge system.  That portion of the total user charge
which is designated for operation and maintenance, including replacement of
the treatment works, shall be established by this chapter.



99.04  ESTABLISHMENT OF FUNDS.



That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for
operation and maintenance including replacement purposes as established in
Section 99.07 shall be deposited in two separate non-lapsing funds, as
follows:



1.   A fund designated as the “Wastewater Treatment Works Operation and
Maintenance Fund” for the specific purpose of defraying operation and
maintenance costs, excluding replacement, of the wastewater treatment and
collection system.



2.   A fund designated as the “Wastewater Treatment Works Replacement
Fund” for the specific purpose of ensuring replacement needs over the
useful life of the wastewater treatment and collection system.



Deposits in these two funds shall be made at least annually from that portion
of the total user charge collected and designated for operation, maintenance
and replacement purposes in the total amount of $360,000 annually.  While
public sanitary sewer revenue bonds of the City are outstanding, the
provision of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall, in
the event of conflict, prevail on the provisions of this section and Section
99.05.



99.05  MAINTENANCE OF FUNDS.



Fiscal year-end balances in the wastewater treatment works operation and
maintenance fund and the wastewater treatment works replacement fund shall be
carried over to the same fund in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be
used for no other purposes than those designated for these funds.  If moneys
are transferred from other funds of the City to meet temporary shortages in
the wastewater treatment works operation and maintenance fund and/or
wastewater treatment works replacement fund, such transferred moneys shall be
returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user
charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement.  The user charge
rates shall be adjusted such that the transferred moneys will be returned to
their respective accounts within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in
which the moneys were borrowed.



99.06  BASIS OF USE DETERMINATION.



The use of the wastewater treatment works shall be determined on the
following basis:



1.   Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on
use of the wastewater treatment works as determined by water meters
acceptable to the City.



   A.   Where a customer wishes to use water for watering a lawn or
garden, filling a swimming pool, or other approved uses that water does not
reach the sanitary sewer system, the customer may at his option have
installed a "garden meter."



      (1)   A "garden meter" is defined as a second meter placed as
to meter outdoor water use described above which does not reach the sanitary
sewer system.  The "garden meter" shall have a remote reading register
outdoors.



      (2)   The full cost of the "garden meter" and any associated
plumbing changes or charges shall be the responsibility of the customer.



   B.   Where a "garden meter" is not installed, an adjustment or
waiver to residential sanitary sewer charges may be allowed under the
following conditions:



      (1)   If the customer can reasonably proved that in any month
that more than fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons of water was used by the
customer in a way that the water did not reach the sanitary sewer, that
amount of water would be exempt from the sewer rate.



      (2)   The waiver would apply only for non-intentional uses.



      (3)   Residential customers would only be eligible for a
waiver from sanitary sewer charges once annually.

the satisfaction of the Council, at the expense of the owner of such private
or unmetered water supplies, and the sanitary sewer user charge shall be
applied to an equal quantity and characteristic of waste as though
originating through use of City water, the same as if metered and billed
accordingly.  If the quantity of water used is estimated to be in excess of
one thousand (1,000) gallons per month for any one billing period, the

charge.  The surcharge for operation and maintenance including replacement
is per the schedule in Chapter 171 of this Code of Ordinances.



99.09  ADDITIONAL CHARGES.



Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the wastewater treatment
works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by
interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost
of operation, maintenance or replacement of the wastewater treatment works,
shall pay for such increased costs.  The charge to each such user shall be
as determined by the Council.



99.10  APPLICATION.



The user charge rates established in this chapter apply to all users,
regardless of their location, of the wastewater treatment works. 



99.11  BILLING.



All sanitary sewer user charges shall be due and payable under the same terms
and conditions as provided for water service in Section 92.04.



99.12  LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.



The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for sewer service charges to the premises. 
Sewer user charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien
upon the premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the County
Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes. 



99.13  CHARGE REVIEW.



The City shall review the user charge system at least every year and revise

regular billing, of the rate being charged for operation and maintenance
including replacement and the rate being charged for sewer bond debt service
for the wastewater treatment works.



99.15  SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.



No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate and cost as established by the
Council.

100.02  FEE; PURPOSE AND INTENT.



The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a
procedure to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing
major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main facilities in those
instances in which a significant number of the properties to be benefited by
such facilities are not sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of
those costs through the special assessment process as provided in Chapter
384, Division IV, Title IX of the Code of Iowa.  The City hereby declares
its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein provided, to recover the
costs of designing and constructing such major sanitary sewer facilities and
major water main facilities from property owners who connect to such
facilities subsequent to their construction.  It is the intent of this
chapter to set forth the method of recovery of proportional cost shares from
those property owners who connect their properties to major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities subsequent to their construction,
so that in the event that all property, other than street and road
right-of-way, which lies within the benefited district is connected to the
major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main facilities during their
expected useful life, then those properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up
to one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of designing and constructing such
facilities, including legal, administrative and interest expenses associated
therewith.



100.03  PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE.



1.   In the event the City Council determines the necessity of
constructing a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility,
and determines that the utilization of a connection fee is the most equitable
manner in which to recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the City
Council shall cause a “Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption of
an Ordinance to Establish a Benefited District and a Connection Fee” to be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City as
hereinafter provided.  In addition to indicating the date, time and place of
the public hearing, the notice shall:



   A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer
facility or facilities, or major water main facility or facilities under
consideration for construction, as well as the estimated cost or costs for
the design and construction of same;



   B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district
to be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities, or major
water main facility or facilities; and



   C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid
by property owners within the benefited district who connect to said
facilities, expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other
method as the City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited district.



2.   The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee
ordinance is on file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both
are available for public inspection in the office of the City Clerk.  The
notice shall be published not more than forty-five (45) days and not less
than twenty (20) days prior to the scheduled date of the public hearing as
shown by the records of the County Auditor.



3.   At the public hearing, owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:



   A.   The necessity for the project;



   B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major
sanitary sewer facilities or major water main facilities;



   C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and



   D.   The proposed connection fee.



4.   Upon concluding the hearing the City Council shall rule upon the
objections presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the
proposed connection fee ordinance.  Upon consideration of the proposed
connection fee ordinance, the Council may:



   A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;



   B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities and major water main facilities from the proposed project
and the properties served thereby from the benefited district proposed, or



   C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.



100.04  ELIGIBILITY FOR CONNECTION.



1.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the City Council’s
discretion, that single-family residences within the benefited district, in
existence or under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, are
eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer facility or major water
main facility.  In that event, the ordinance shall include the following
provisions:



   A.   That the owners of residences on parcels of five (5) acres or
less in size and located within an existing recorded subdivision located
within the benefited district may connect such residences to the major
sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility upon approval of their
application for connection, payment of the connection fee for the parcel, and
construction, at the owner’s expense, of appropriate connection structures,
as determined necessary by the City, and



   B.   That the owners of residences on parcels of more than five (5)
acres but less than ten (10) acres in size and located within an existing
recorded subdivision located within the benefited district may connect such
residences to the major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility
upon approval of their application for connection, payment of the connection
fee for five (5) acres of benefited property, and construction, at the
owner’s expense, of appropriate connection structures, as determined
necessary by the City, and



   C.   That the owners of residences on parcels of ten (10) acres or
more in size located within the benefited district may connect such
residences to the major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility
upon approval of their application for connection, subdivision of said parcel
into a residence parcel of at least one and one-half (1½) acres minimum and
an outlot, payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and
construction, at the owner’s expense, of appropriate connection structures,
as determined necessary by the City, and



   D.   Any single family residence existing or under construction that
has applied for connection to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water
main facility within a benefited district but is outside of the City limits
shall include with the application for connection an irrevocable Application
for Voluntary Annexation to the City.



   E.   Any property subdivided for development purposes within a
Connection Fee District shall be assessed the required fee for the total
boundary area of the proposed subdivision.



2.   The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the City
Council’s discretion, that sanitary sewer service or water service can be
provided to recreational and park facilities, and to commercial and
industrial parcels and facilities, in the same manner and under the same
procedures set forth in this chapter for single-family residences within the
benefited district.



3.   All other property located within the benefited district shall be
eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer facility or water main
facility upon approval of an application for connection by the owner thereof,
as hereinafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such property,
provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for development,
and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements and/or water main
improvements necessary to serve said property have been constructed, at the
owner’s expense, and accepted by the City.



100.05  APPLICATION; FEE.



1.   After adoption, publication and recording by the City Clerk in each
county where property in the benefited district is located, of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major
sanitary sewer facility or water main facility, shall make application to the
City for such connection.  The submittal of construction plans to the City
for sanitary sewer improvements and/or water main improvements on property
being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to the City
for purposes of this section.  The sewer connection fee or water connection
fee shall be due and payable at the time application is made to the City for
connection to the major sanitary sewer facility or major water main
facility.  No connection shall be made to a major sanitary sewer facility or
major water main facility until such application has been approved and until
the required connection fee has been paid.  The sewer connection fee and/or
water connection fee required by this section shall be paid before the City
will approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.



2.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be in an
amount equal to the maximum acre area of contiguous property, or fraction
thereof, within the benefited district under common ownership which can be
lawfully served through such proposed connection, multiplied by the per acre
connection fee or such other fee basis as determined for the benefited
district established in the connection fee ordinance for that benefited
district.  The connection fee ordinance may provide for a graduated
connection fee, with annual interest adjustments, such that property owners
who connect in later years pay interest on the connection fee for their
property.  The rate of interest applicable to the connection fee established
in each benefited district shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable
to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3), Title
IX, of the Code of Iowa in effect on the date that the connection fee was
established for that district by enactment of a connection fee ordinance.



3.   The sewer connection fee and/or water connection fee required by this
section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees for connection
required under the Plumbing Code or other provisions of this Code of
Ordinances.



4.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this
section shall be due and payable to the City.



100.06  DISCONNECTION.



In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
benefited district to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main
facility without having made application therefor or without having received
approval therefor or without having paid the required connection fee
established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to
disconnect such private sewer connection or private water connection until
such time as the property owner has made and received approval of the
application, and/or has paid the required connection fee and satisfied all of
the requirements of Sections 100.04 and 100.05.

Residential customers must pay to the City the amount of the monthly fee for
solid waste management, pursuant to Section 106.09, within twenty (20) days
from the rendering of the statement of account.  If any account is not paid
within the 20-day period, the City Attorney is authorized to pursue
collection of these fees by whatever legal means available; or, as an
alternative, the City Clerk is authorized to certify the unpaid nature of the
account to the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property
taxes.



106.12  LATE PAYMENT OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT FEES.



If the monthly fees are not paid within twenty (20) days after being
rendered, a late payment charge shall be added for the amount of one and

exceed capacity available at the location.



9.   Large Power/Lighting Rate (100-1000 kW).  Three-phase 4-wire power
and lighting service where the fifteen (15) minute kilowatt demands exceed
100 kW and less than a 1,000 kW, or motor size exceeds twenty-five (25) hp. 



   A.   Billing Demand.  The billing demand for computing the demand
charges for the month shall be the highest recorded fifteen (15) minute
kilowatt demand for the month adjusted for any power factor penalty.



   B.   Power Factor Penalty.  For any month in which the customer's
power factor is less than ninety percent (90%) during the period of the
customer's peak demand for the month, the billing demand shall be the actual
measured maximum demand multiplied by ninety percent (90%) divided by the
actual power factor for the same period.  Example:




      Metered Peak Demand         = 500 kW





      Actual Power Factor during





         Peak Demand Period         = 87%




      Billing Demand = (500 x 90/87)      = 517 kW



   If during the month a similarly adjusted metered demand establishes a
higher peak demand, it may become the billing demand for the month.



10.   Large Power and Lighting Rate (1000-5000 kW).  Three-phase 4-wire
power and lighting service where the fifteen (15) minute kilowatt demands
exceed 1,000 kW and are less than 5,000 kW.

charges for the month shall be the highest recorded fifteen (15) minute
kilowatt demand for the month adjusted for any power factor penalty.



   B.   Power Factor Penalty.  For any month in which the customer's
power factor is less than ninety percent (90%) during the period of the
customer's peak demand for the month, the billing demand shall be the actual
measured maximum demand multiplied by ninety percent (90%) divided by the
actual power factor for the same period.  Example:




      Metered Peak Demand         = 2,000 kW





      Actual Power Factor during





         Peak Demand Period         = 87%




      Billing Demand = (2000 x 90/87)      = 2,069 kW



   If during the month a similarly adjusted metered demand establishes a
higher peak demand, it may become the billing demand for the month.



11.   Large Industrial Power (>5000 kW).  Three-phase 4-wire power and
lighting service where the fifteen (15) minute kilowatt demands exceed 5,000
kW and whose metering delivery and metering point is at the primary voltage
of 4.16 kV or 12.5 kV. 



   A.   Billing Demand.  The billing demand for computing the demand
charges for the month shall be the highest recorded fifteen (15) minute
kilowatt demand for the month adjusted for any power factor penalty.



   B.   Power Factor Penalty.  For any month in which the customer's
power factor is less than ninety-five percent (95%) during the period of the
customer's peak demand for the month, the billing demand shall be the actual
measured maximum demand multiplied by ninety-five percent (95%) divided by
the actual power factor for the same period.  Example:




      Metered Peak Demand         = 8,000 kW





      Average Monthly Power Factor





          during Peak Demand Period      = 92%




      Billing Demand = (8000 x 95/92)      = 8,261 kW



   If during the month a similarly adjusted metered demand establishes a
higher peak demand, it may become the billing demand for the month.



12.   Security Lights.  Lighting energy and service shall be available
for security lighting where it is impossible or impractical to meter the
electrical energy through the customer's normal metering location.  The
security lighting rate shall be subject to the following conditions:



   A.   New service agreements shall be three (3) years minimum.



   B.   New installation for "security lights" will normally only be
made with 100-, 150- or 250-watt high pressure sodium light fixtures on
existing poles with a maximum of 150-foot span of wire. 



Other types and sizes of lighting fixtures may be provided in accordance with
a written agreement.



13.   Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA).  Retail billings may be adjusted
monthly for annual variations in the average cost of power, calculated
annually and approved by Council through resolution. The Energy Cost
Adjustment shall be calculated as follows:



   (A+B)/C-$0.077 = ECA



   Where:



      A = Annual projected power and transmission costs for the next
calendar year.



      B = Actual cost of fuel for local generation in excess of
$45,000.00 in the previous year.



      C = Annual projected kWh.



      $0.077 = Base Power Cost (Already included in the rate
structures).



      ECA = Factor to apply to monthly bills.



The ECA shall be applied to all classes except security lighting.



It is to be implemented in years when the annual costs for power and
transmission (excluding MISO revenue received by Pella) combined with
previous year costs for diesel fuel in excess of $45,000 are projected to
exceed 7.7 cents. Projected annual power and transmission costs and projected
kWh are based on Missouri River Energy Services annual forecast for Pella.



(Ord. 892 - Feb. 15 Supp.)



111.10  LATE PAYMENT CHARGE.



Where the electric bill is not paid within twenty (20) days after being
rendered, a late payment charge shall be added in the amount of one and
one-half percent (1.5%) per month of the past due amount.



111.11  RETURNED CHECK CHARGE.



A service charge as set out in Chapter 171 of this Code of Ordinances shall
be charged for each check issued by a customer which is returned unpaid by
the bank upon which it was drawn.



111.12  NEW SERVICE.



Any new service provided under the rate schedules shall be on contract or
agreement to take such service for a minimum period of one year, provided the
consumer occupies the premises for that period.

The Franchise shall be cancelled when any of the following are evident
subsequent to completion of the due process provisions including notice and
opportunity to cure in Sections 113.24 through 113.27:



1.   If the Grantee should default in the performance of any of its

government access.



9.   For violation of the books and financial records provisions of the

10.   For violations of other material provisions of the Franchising
Agreement or the Ordinance.



11.   In the event the system fails to meet FCC minimum performance
standards for a full three-month period.



113.05  CONDITIONS OF OCCUPANCY OF RIGHT OF WAY. 



All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and
equipment installed or erected by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof
shall be so located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper
use of public ways, and with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners who own property that adjoins any of such public ways.



113.06  RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS. 



Whenever the Grantee, in erecting, constructing, or maintaining said systems,
shall take up or disturb the pavement or sidewalk or make any excavation on
the streets, avenues, alleys, highways, or public grounds of said City, such
excavations shall be refilled and the pavement, sidewalk, or other
improvement replaced in accordance with City approved standards and
specifications.  However, before opening or making any excavation in any
street or alley, the Grantee shall secure from said City a written permit to
do so, except in cases of emergency.  The City shall issue a permit to the
Grantee upon reasonable terms and conditions unless otherwise stated.  All
restoration will be at the expense of the Grantee.  The Grantee shall
conform to safety regulations, laws and ordinances prescribed by the City of
Pella, State of Iowa and any other regulatory authority.  No service shall
be laid upon the surface of the ground, sidewalk or roadway.  Temporary
service when required, may be laid upon the surface of the ground, but shall
be restrained by clips or other devices if located upon right of way.  No
temporary service shall be placed upon a public sidewalk.  Temporary service
shall be converted to permanent service within fourteen (14) working days,
except temporary services may be permitted from December 15th thru March
31st.  Temporary services so permitted shall be converted to permanent
services by May 1st of each successive year. 



113.07  RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF CITY. 



Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five (5)
business days, the Grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate in the public way or remove from the public
way any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason
of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street
construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of
sewers, drains, electric infrastructure, gas or water pipes or any other type
of structures or improvements by the City, but the Grantee shall in all cases
have the right of abandonment of its property.



113.08  TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY. 



Upon seven (7) days notice the Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees
and other natural growth overhanging any of its system in the service area
within the right of way so as to prevent the branches of the trees from
coming in contact with the Grantee's wires, cables and other equipment.  The
Grantee shall reasonably compensate the City for any damages caused by such
trimming or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense,
reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any
construction of the cable system undertaken by the Grantee.  Such
replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations the Grantee may have to the
City pursuant to the terms of this section.



113.09  SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. 



Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable system shall be
performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner.  All such work shall be
performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other Federal,
State and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.  The
cable system shall not unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of
persons or property in the service area.



113.10 AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION. 



In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing
telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee
likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground.  In those areas of the service area
where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are both
aerial and underground, the City shall determine whether the construction or
operation of distribution or transmission facility or any part hereof be
aerially or underground.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities provided telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the
effective date of this chapter, the Grantee shall only be required to
construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice and access to the
public utilities  facilities at the time that such are placed underground. 
Upon written request by the City no later than January 1 of each year, the
Grantee shall file with the Director of Public Works, prior to March 1 of
each year, a current digital and hardcopy detailed documentation of the
location of Grantee's infrastructure, as well as a proposed
construction/reconstruction schedule.  All such documentation of
infrastructure shall be considered confidential and proprietary.  Other than
emergency situations, there shall be no installation activities on Sundays. 
All equipment boxes, pedestals and appurtenances shall be kept rust-free,
plumb, true and enclosed.



1.   Sight Corner Visibility.  On a corner lot, nothing shall be erected
or placed in such a manner as to impede vision between a height of two and
one-half feet (2½') and twelve feet (12') above the surface of the street
described as follows:  an area forming a triangle bounded by the street
right-of-way lines or property lines of a corner lot and a straight line
joining points on the right-of-way lines twenty-five feet (25') from the
point of intersection of the right-of-way or property lines.



113.11  REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE. 



The system, as constructed as of the date of the passage and final adoption
of the ordinance codified in this chapter, substantially complies with the
material provisions hereof.  Grantee agrees to provide Cable Service to all
residences in the Service Area subject to the density requirements specified
in this section.  Whenever the Grantee receives a request for Cable Service
from a potential Subscriber in an unserved area contiguous to Grantee's
existing distribution facilities where there are at least 10 residences
within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from the
portion of the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended,
it shall extend its Cable System to such Subscribers at no cost to said
Subscribers for the Cable System extension, other than the published
Standard/non-Standard Installation fees charged to all Subscribers. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to extend the Cable System into any portion of the Service Area
where another operator is providing Cable Service, into any annexed area
which is not contiguous to the present Service Area of the Grantee, or into
any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary
circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.



113.12  SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM.



No Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.  However, if an area
does not meet the density requirements of Section 113.11 above, the Grantee
shall only be required to extend the Cable System to Subscriber(s) in that
area if the Subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending
the Cable System.  Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital
amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction
whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1320 cable-bearing
strand feet from the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable, and whose
denominator equals 10.  Subscribers who request service hereunder shall bear
the remaining cost to extend the Cable System on a pro rata basis.  The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid in advance. 
Subscribers shall also be responsible for any Standard/non-Standard
Installation charges to extend the Cable System from the tap to the residence.



113.13  SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 



The Grantee shall, upon request, provide without charge one outlet of basic
service to any City offices, fire station(s), police station(s) and public
school building(s) that are passed by its system.  The outlets of basic
cable service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services in or
throughout such buildings.  Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee
harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of
such outlets, including but not limited to those arising from copyright
liability.



113.14  EMERGENCY USE. 



In the case of any emergency or disaster, the Grantee shall, upon request of
the City, make available its facilities for the City to provide emergency
information and instructions during the emergency or disaster period. 
Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the City shall hold the
Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising
out of the emergency use of its facilities by the City, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.



113.15 PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENT (PEG) ACCESS.



Grantee will continue to provide to the City throughout the term of this
franchise one (1) PEG Access channel currently in use by the City originating
from 712 Union Street.  In addition, the Grantee shall construct the Cable
System in such a way to allow live PEG access channel origination from the
City Council Chambers located at 614 Main Street no later than June 30,
2007.  All production equipment including video, audio and editing equipment
shall be the owned and operated by the City.  If the initial PEG Access
channel is in use for original, locally produced programming only, (excluding
without limitation, character generated programming and repeats) during 80%
of the time available on weekdays between the hours of 7 a.m. and midnight
for six (6) consecutive weeks, Grantee will provide one additional PEG
channel(s) within six (6) months from a request by the Franchising Authority
a) if there is evidence of a demand for PEG use of an additional channel, b)
the provision of such additional channel will not require Grantee to install
converters or add to the channel capacity of the cable system nor violate
agreements with respect to channel use then in effect.  The City will
provide Grantee with reasonable documentation of such utilization and
increased demand.  In no event shall the second PEG channel be created
before June 30, 2007.  The Grantee shall not be required to provide more
than 2 access channels during the term of the agreement.  An Access channel
is a channel made available to the City by Grantee for the purpose of
cablecasting non-commercial programming by Franchising Authority residents,
City administration and educational institutions.  The City agrees not to
use the access channel to provide commercial or revenue-generating services
or services that may compete, directly or indirectly, with services provided
by the Grantee, provided however, that the City may cablecast acknowledgments
of funding sources and the underwriting of programming costs.  Such
acknowledgements will be deemed non-commercial if they are within the
standards for underwriting applicable to the Public Broadcasting Service
(PBS) or the standards necessary to maintain tax-exempt status within the
applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.  Programming shall
not lose its non-commercial character by reason of including public or
charitable fund-raising events or activities, or donor and underwriting
announcements reflecting funding provided by for-profit or non-profit
entities for PEG programming in accordance with the provisions of 47 C.F.R.
73.621 of the FCC's Rules.



113.16  FRANCHISE FEE. 



The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee equal to five percent (5%)
of the gross revenues (as defined in Section 113.01 of this chapter) received
by the Grantee from the operation of the Cable System on a quarterly basis. 
The Grantor may request an increase in franchise fees at any time during the
term of the franchise, equal to the maximum percentage allowed by federal
law.  However, such request shall be made in writing and the Grantee will
not be liable for said increase until proper notice, as defined by federal
law, is given to its subscriber.  The Grantor shall conduct a public hearing
and shall grant an opportunity to the Grantee to discuss the proposed
increase in franchise fee.  For the purpose of this section, the 12-month
period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise
fee shall be the calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
City and the Grantee.  The franchise fee payment shall be due and payable
forty-five (45) days after the close of the preceding quarterly period. 
Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report from an authorized
representative of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation.  The
Grantee agrees that the City may assess a late fee, not to exceed 1.5% per
month, for franchise fees not paid within 45 days after the close of the
preceding quarterly period.



113.17  RATES AND CHARGES. 



The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and equipment as
expressly permitted by the Cable Act or other applicable Federal or State law.



113.18  RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE. 



The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the City
that relate to the renewal of the Grantee's franchise shall be governed by
and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act, as amended,
unless the procedures and substantive protections set forth therein shall be
deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent
provision of Federal or State law.  In addition to the procedures set forth
in said Section 626(a), the City agrees to notify the Grantee of its
assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs
and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee under the then
current franchise term.  The City further agrees that such a preliminary
assessment shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee has
adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b) of the Cable Act and
complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then
current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the City and Grantee may agree to undertake and
finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current
franchise and the City may grant a renewal thereof.  The Grantee and the
City consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the
express provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.



113.19  TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE. 



The Grantee's right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.  No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in
trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights,
title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or system in order to
secure indebtedness.  Within thirty (30) days after receiving the request
for transfer, the City shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations,
notify the Grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the
legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.  If the
City has not taken action on the Grantee's request for transfer within 120
days after receiving such request, consent by the City shall be deemed given.



113.20  TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE. 



The City may perform technical tests of the system during reasonable times
and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of the Grantee or the system in order to determine
whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and
applicable State or Federal laws.  Except in emergency circumstances, such
tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice
thereof, not to be less than two business days, and providing a
representative of the Grantee an opportunity to be present during such
tests.  The Grantee will perform tests and provide the City documentation at
least once during a five-year cycle at the Grantee's expense upon the written
request of the City.



113.21  BOOKS AND RECORDS. 



The Grantee agrees that the City, upon reasonable notice to the Grantee, may
review such of its books and records at the Grantee's business office, during
normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms hereof.  Such records shall
include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be kept
by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee shall not
be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature.  The City agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the Grantee to it as confidential and only to
disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need
to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.  The Grantee shall
not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631
of the Cable Act.



113.22  INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. 



Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense,
during the term of the franchise, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance
in the amount of $2,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage.  The Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance
designating the City as an additional insured.  Such insurance shall be
non-cancelable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City.



113.23 INDEMNIFICATION. 



The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the City,
its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for
damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or
bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee's
construction, operation or maintenance of its system, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, provided that the City
shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the City
within ten (10) days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this
section.  If the City determines that it is necessary for it to employ
separate counsel, the costs for such separate counsel shall be the
responsibility of the City.



113.24  NOTICE OF VIOLATION. 



Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or
response required by the Franchise to be served upon the City or the Grantee
shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the
required party five business days after having been posted in a properly

Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in
Section 113.24 to: (i) respond to the City contesting the assertion of
noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by
the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day
period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City
of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.



113.26  PUBLIC HEARING. 



In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described in
Section 113.24 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 113.24, or in
the event that the alleged default is not remedied within thirty (30) days of
the date projected pursuant to Section 113.25(iii) above, the City shall
schedule a public hearing to investigate the default.  Such public hearing
shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Council,
provided such time is not less than five (5) business days there from.  The
City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and place of such
meeting and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.



113.27  ENFORCEMENT. 



Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event the City, after
such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of
the franchise, the City may:



1.   Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;



2.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief;



3.   Revoke the franchise in accordance with Section 113.04 of this
chapter and the following:



   A.   The City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent
to revoke the franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance by the
Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a
material provision of the franchise.  The notice shall set forth the exact
nature of the noncompliance.  The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days after
such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such
objection.  In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response
from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public
meeting.  The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least ten
(10) days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time
and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such termination.



   B.   At the designated meeting, the City shall give the Grantee an
opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall
determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked.  The Grantee may
appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power
to review the decision of the City de novo and to modify or reverse such
decision as justice may require.  Such appeal to the appropriate court must
be taken within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the determination of
the City.



   C.   The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action
which it deems appropriate to enforce the City's rights under the franchise
in lieu of revocation of the franchise.



4.   The Grantee and City agree that in the case of a revocation of the
franchise, the City may require the Grantee to continue to operate pursuant
to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall such
requirement exceed a period of time greater than six (6) months from the
effective date of such revocation.



113.28  CONDITIONS OF SALE. 



If a renewal or extension of the Grantee's franchise is denied or the
franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires
ownership of the system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of
ownership of the system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer
shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in
Section 627 of the Cable Act.  The Grantee and the City agree that in the
case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at the
Grantee's request, which shall be made solely at the Grantee's discretion,
the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer
of its system to a qualified third party.  The City further agrees that
during such a period of time, it shall authorize the Grantee to continue to
operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event
shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six months from
the effective date of such revocation.  If, at the end of that time, the
Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of
its system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and the
City may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or
State law; it being further agreed that the Grantee's continued operation of
its system during the six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver or
an extinguishment of any rights of either the City or the Grantee.



113.29  IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE. 



The Grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions
of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where
such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes, acts of God,
power outages or other events reasonable beyond its ability to control.



113.30  ACTIONS OF PARTIES.



In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and
timely manner.  Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is
required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



113.31  EQUAL PROTECTION.



In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization
or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than the
Grantee to enter into the City's streets and public ways for the purpose of
constructing or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any
part of the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be
granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all
parties equal protection under the law.  It is agreed that the foregoing
provisions have been inserted in this chapter to assure the Grantee that the
City does not intend to grant other potential cable television providers an
unfair competitive advantage over the Grantee during the term of the
franchise.  Nothing contained in this section or in any other provisions of
the franchise shall be construed to prohibit the City from exercising a
portion or all of its authority, powers, duties and obligations which, as an
Iowa municipal corporation, it deems necessary or appropriate and in the best
interests of the City and its citizens and which are derived from the
Constitution of the United States of America or the State of Iowa,
legislative statutes, case law of the various court systems, regulatory
authority or any other body of law or authority whatsoever, and whether
discretionary or not, including but not limited to participation in systems
which relate to fiber optic data transmission, telecommunication services,
interactive audio and video conferences and such other communications systems
as may be or may become technologically developed and available during the
term of the franchise, it being understood that the State of Iowa Fiber Optic
Network is currently available for the benefit of the City and the
surrounding area from its point of presence at Central College, that the
nature and extent of future developments in the communications area during
the term of the franchise are difficult to predict and define, and that the
City intends to avail itself of any appropriate opportunities which are or
become available in the communications systems or other areas, all for the
benefit and promotion of the City, its citizens, businesses and other
institutions, and its economy.



113.32  OTHER ORDINANCES.



The Grantee agrees to comply with the terms of any lawfully adopted generally
applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the provisions of the
ordinance do not have the effect of limiting the benefits or expanding the
obligations of the Grantee that are granted by this Franchise.  Neither
party may unilaterally alter the material rights and obligations set forth in
this Franchise.  In the event of a conflict between any ordinance and this
Franchise, the Franchise shall control.



113.33  RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.



Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this franchise will not constitute,
or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either expressly or impliedly, by
Grantee of any constitutional or legal right which it may have or may be
determined to have, either by subsequent legislation or court decisions. 
The Franchising Authority acknowledges that Grantee reserves all of its
rights under applicable Federal and State Constitutions and laws.  If at any
time during the term of this franchise, Federal, State or local law permits
any provider of video programming to provide services such as those provided
pursuant to this franchise either without obtaining a franchise from the
Franchising Authority or on terms or conditions more favorable than those
applicable to the Grantee, then this franchise shall at the sole discretion
of the Grantee: (1) cease to be in effect; or (2) be deemed to expire at a
date prior to the original expiration date selected by the  Grantee; or (3)
will be automatically reformed to grant to the Grantee the more favorable
terms, benefits and conditions available to the other provider.

123.01  PURPOSE.



The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that special events are promoted and
staged in a manner which preserves the safety of both our citizens and
visitors to our City; to ensure that all promoters of these events are
treated fairly and in accordance with their particular needs in the promotion
of the event; to promote the economic well-being of our community through the
orderly attraction of people to these events; and to ensure City personnel
adequate opportunity to prepare for and provide services for the events so as
to provide them the maximum opportunity for success.



123.02  DEFINITIONS.



For the purpose of this chapter certain terms and words are hereby defined.



1.   “Special event” means an event sponsored by an individual,
organization, club, group, partnership or corporation in which the public is
invited to attend and which requires the use of public streets or other
public property as a staging area for promotion of the event.



2.   “Special event area” means a place designated by the special
event promoter as provided in this chapter where the general public is
invited to gather for an event and where the area of interest of the promoter
will be promoted and/or celebrated and where, in connection with the special
event, there may be displays, speeches, the performance of music or the arts,
games, and other similar celebrations, and the sale and/or distribution of
literature, antiques, crafts, curios, art or artifacts, food, and other
similar items, all under the sponsorship of a “special event promoter” as
defined in this section.  The area designated as a special event area may
include property which is privately owned, provided that the inclusion of
private property within the special event area shall not be construed as
requiring the owner of the private property to participate in or otherwise
allow the property to be used in the special event without his, her or its
consent, or as prohibiting the owner of the private property from using the
private property in a manner otherwise allowed by law.



3.   “Special event merchant” means an individual, organization, club,
group, partnership or corporation which engages in the sale of items within a
“special event area” as defined in this section through the permission of
the special event promoter. 



4.   “Special event promoter” means an individual, organization, club,
group, partnership or corporation which organizes, sponsors, promotes or

authorized personnel to enter and exit the special event area.  It shall be
the responsibility of the special event promoter to arrange for the personnel
who will attend the barricades.  If reserve police officers are requested

2.   Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter.



3.   Promoting the special event in an unlawful manner or in such a manner
as to constitute a breach of the peace or to constitute a menace to the

123.15  APPEALS.



Any person aggrieved by the action of the Police Chief in revoking or
suspending a permit or by the action of the City Council in the denial of a
permit may appeal to the City Council.  Such appeal shall be taken by filing
with the City Clerk, within fourteen (14) days after the notice of the action
complained of, a written statement setting forth fully the grounds for such
appeal.  The City Clerk shall set a time and place for hearing on such
appeal and notice of such hearing shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the
appellant at its last known address at least five (5) days prior to the date
set for hearing, or shall be delivered by a police officer in the same manner
as a summons at least three (3) days prior to the date set for hearing.  The

123.16  PEDDLER, SOLICITOR, AND TRANSIENT MERCHANT PERMITS.



A special event promoter may, in its application for a special event permit,
request the City Council to temporarily limit the areas within the City for
which a peddler, solicitor or transient merchant permit provided under
Chapter 122 of this Code of Ordinances may be issued to an applicant
thereunder during the time period for which a permit is issued under this
chapter.  In making its request, the special event promoter shall suggest
particular areas within the City limits which the special event promoter
believes would be appropriate for the issuance of peddler, solicitor or
transient merchant permits during the time period in question.  If the City
Council agrees with the suggested limitation of areas for which a peddler,
solicitor or transient merchant permit may be issued during the time period
for which a permit is issued under this chapter, the City Council shall adopt
a resolution providing for the modification of the issuance of peddler,
solicitor and transient merchant permits as requested in the application
hereunder.  In adopting its resolution, the City Council shall be required
to find that the permitted special event is of City-wide interest, promotes
the well-being and reputation of the City, and that the issuance of a
peddler, solicitor or transient merchant permit on a City-wide basis
concurrent with the permitted special event would detract from the benefits
provided by the permitted special event.  If the City Council adopts the
resolution as previously required, the exclusion for yard sales contained in
the second to the last sentence of the definition of “transient merchant”
set forth in Section 122.02(3) of this Code of Ordinances shall not be
available during the time period for which the issuance of a peddler,
solicitor or transient merchant permit is so restricted.

1.   “Business alarm” means any device that detects intrusion,
criminal activity, fire or other problem and alerts the police to a

2.   “Non-chargeable alarm” includes alarms signaling criminal
activity (burglary, robbery, criminal mischief, etc.) fire, power failure
and/or utility company interruption that causes the police to be summoned,

(mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation), carelessness,
neglect or other known causes when, in fact no condition exists which would
trigger the alarm to alert authorities of the need for an immediate response.



124.02  FALSE ALARM FEES.



Alarm users will be charged for each false alarm in accordance with the fee
schedule set out in Chapter 171 of this Code of Ordinances.  New alarm users
shall be granted thirty (30) days after installation, without a fee schedule
charge.  The fee schedule is based on false alarms during each calendar year.



124.03  PAYMENT OF FEES.



False alarms shall be billed directly by the Police Department, according to
the alarm fee schedule in Chapter 171.  False alarm fees shall be paid
within thirty (30) days of the billing date.  If the false alarm fee is not

124.05  ALARM RECONNECTION.



Any alarm user whose alarm system has been disconnected from the police
communication center or is refused police response is not precluded under
this section from applying for a new connection or service.  The Police
Chief, however, is not required to allow a new connection or authorize
response unless past deficiencies have been corrected and the Police Chief is
satisfied that the applicant will meet the obligations proposed under this
chapter in the future.



124.06  ALARM USER REQUIREMENTS.



All alarm users must provide the police department with:



1.   A list of key holders’ names, addresses and telephone numbers to
notify when alarms occur;

Failure to provide the police department with the above may result in the
Police Chief’s issuing a written notice by first class mail or personal
delivery of the intention to disconnect the alarm user’s alarm from its
connection to the police department and/or refusal to authorize response by
police department personnel to future alarms from that alarm user’s alarm

obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless
such person shall first have obtained an excavation permit therefor from the
Public Works Department as provided in this chapter.



141.03  APPLICATION.



No excavation permit shall be issued unless a written application for the
issuance of an excavation permit is submitted to the Public Works on forms
provided.  The application shall be accompanied by plans showing the extent
of the proposed excavation work, the dimensions and elevations if required,
of both the existing ground prior to the excavation and of the proposed
excavated surfaces, the location of the excavation work, and such other
information as may be reasonably related to the above and location of the

141.04  FEES.



A permit fee shall be charged by the Public Works Department for the issuance
of an excavation permit which shall be in addition to all other fees for
permits or charges relative to any proposed construction work.  The
excavation permit fee shall be in an amount varying with the type of surface
to be opened, dug or excavated under the permit issued per opening as follows:

2.   By a surety company authorized to transact business in the State;



3.   Satisfactory in form and substance to the City Attorney;



4.   Conditioned upon the permittee’s compliance with this chapter and
to secure and hold the City and its officers harmless against any and all
claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work
covered by the excavation permit or for which the City, the Council or any
City officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to
persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly
guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence
of the permittee, and further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in
good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to
maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the
period of four (4) years after said work shall have been done, usual wear and
tear excepted, as it was in before the work shall have been done.  Surety
bond will be released upon approved and inspected completion of the
excavation.



5.   Any settlement of the surface within said 4-year period shall be
deemed prima facie evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee. 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the permittee to
maintain any repairs to pavement made by the City if such repairs should
prove defective.  Any owner of real estate, repairing or engaging another to
repair his or her own sidewalk, shall not be required to give such bond. 
Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond
but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries
during the excavation work for which it is given.  In the event of any suit
or claim against the City by reason of the negligence or default of the
permittee, upon the City’s giving written notice to the permittee of such
suit or claim, any final judgment against the City requiring it to pay for
such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and the permittee’s
surety.  An annual bond may be given under this provision which shall remain
in force for one year conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and
in other respects as specified above but applicable as to all excavation work
in streets by the principal in such bond during the term of one year from the
date.

The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the
performance of the excavation work traffic conditions, as nearly normal as
practicable, shall be maintained at all times so as to cause as little
inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the abutting property and to
the general public.  However, the Public Works Department may permit the
closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by the
Public Works Department if in the Director’s opinion it is necessary.  The
permittee shall route and control traffic including its own vehicles as
directed by the Public Works Department.  The following steps shall be taken
before any street may be closed or the traffic restricted in any way:



1.   The permittee must receive the approval of the Public Works
Department.



2.   The Public Works Department must notify the Police Department of any
street so closed.



3.   Upon completion of construction work, the permittee shall notify the
Public Works Department before traffic is moved back to its normal flow for
any necessary adjustment to be made.



4.   Where the Public Works Department deems flagmen to be necessary, they
shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense.  Through traffic
shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible; in instances in
which this would not be feasible, the Public Works Department shall designate
detours.  The City shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways
designated as detours without expense to the permittee.  However, if there
are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its
expense and in conformity with the specifications of the City.  The
permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any
highways by the operation of its equipment.



141.07  CLEARANCE FOR FIRE EQUIPMENT.



The excavation work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere
with access to fire stations and fire hydrants.  Materials or obstructions
shall not be placed within fifteen (15) feet of fire hydrants.  Passageways
leading to fire escapes or fire-fighting equipment shall be kept free of
piles of material or other obstructions.  The Chief of the Fire Department
shall interpret this provision in each case so as to insure free access for
fire-fighting equipment as so provided.



141.08  PROTECTION OF TRAFFIC.



The permittee shall erect and maintain suitable barriers to confine earth
from trenches or other excavations in order to encroach upon streets as
little as possible.  The permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and
safe crossings over excavations and across streets under improvement to
accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. 
Pedestrian crossings shall be not less than four (4) feet in width and shall
be provided with a railing.



141.09  REMOVAL AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.



The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the
written consent of the Public Works Department and the utility company or
person owning the utility.  If it becomes necessary to remove an existing
utility, this shall be done by its owner.  No utility owned by the City
shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is
borne by the permittee.  The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall
likewise be borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with
the person owning the utility.  The permittee shall support and protect by
timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus
which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything
necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across
the work.  In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wire or apparatus
should be damaged as a result of permittee’s negligence, they shall be
repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs
shall be charged to the permittee, and the permittee’s bond shall be so
liable.  The permittee shall be responsible for the permittee’s damage
done to any public or private property by reason of the permittee’s
negligently breaking any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe, electric conduit or
other utility, and its bond shall be liable for such damage.  The permittee
shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground
utilities and protect the same against damage.  Nothing in this provision
shall be construed as preventing permittee from recovering damages from a
legally responsible party.



141.10  PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.



The permittee shall at all times and at the permittee’s own expense protect
from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking
other measures suitable for the purpose.  Where in the protection of such
property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission
from the owner of such private property for such purpose.  The permittee
shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences,
or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation
work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or
streets resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out the
work.  Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any
established lawn area, the existing sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and
replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in this chapter. 
New sod may be used or seeding with approval of the City.  All construction
and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn
area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to
that which existed before the work began.  The permittee shall not remove
even temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist on public property without
first notifying and obtaining consent of the appropriate City department or
City official having control of such property.



141.11  SIDEWALK EXCAVATIONS.



Any excavation made in or under any sidewalk shall be provided with a
substantial and adequate footbridge as determined by the City over the
excavation on the line of the sidewalk.  This bridge shall be at least four
(4) feet wide and securely railed on each side so that foot passengers can
pass over safely at all times.



141.12  PROTECTIVE MEASURES.



The permittee shall erect such fence, railing or barriers about the site of
the excavation work as shall prevent damage to persons using the City street
or sidewalks.  These protective barriers shall be maintained until the work
shall be completed or the danger removed.  At twilight there shall be placed
upon such place of excavation and upon any excavated materials or structures
or other obstructions to streets, suitable and sufficient lights which shall
be kept burning throughout the night during the maintenance of such
obstructions.



141.13  CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.



All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in
any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining properties.  Where the confines of the area being excavated are
too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such
as might be the case in a narrow alley, the Public Works Department shall
have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material
to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of
backfilling.  It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the
necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required
storage and disposal sites.



141.14  DAMAGE TO EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.



All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the
excavation work shall be repaired by the permittee.  Materials for such
repair shall conform with the requirements of any applicable code or
ordinance.  If upon being ordered, the permittee fails to furnish the
necessary labor and materials for such repairs, the Public Works Department
shall have the authority to cause the necessary labor and materials to be
furnished by the City.  The cost of the necessary labor and materials shall
be charged against the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable on
the permittee’s bond.



141.15  PROPERTY LINES AND EASEMENTS.



Property lines or curb lines and limits of easements shall be indicated on
the plan of excavation submitted with the application for the excavation
permit.  It is the permittee’s responsibility to confine excavation work
within these limits.



141.16  CLEANUP.



As the excavation work progresses, all streets and private properties shall
be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris
resulting from the work.  All clean-up operations at the location of the
excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be
completed to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department.  From time to
time as may be ordered by the Public Works Department and in any event
immediately after completion of the work, the permittee shall at the
permittee’s expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of
any kind resulting from the work.  Upon failure to do so within 24 hours
after having been notified to do so by the Public Works Department, the work
may be done by the City and this cost charged to the permittee.  The
permittee shall also be liable for such under the surety bond provided by
this chapter.



141.17  PROTECTION OF WATER COURSES.



The permittee shall provide for the flow of all water courses, sewers or
drains intercepted during the excavation work and shall replace the same in
as good condition as it found them or shall make such provisions for them as
the Public Works Department may direct.  The permittee shall not obstruct
the gutter of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the
free passage of surface water.  The permittee shall make provision to take
care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings or other run-off pumped from
excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations.  The permittee
shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its failure to so provide.



141.18  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.



All removals, construction and restoration shall be in conformance with the
Urban Design Standard Specificationsand OSHA requirements.



141.19  CITY’S RIGHT TO RESTORE SURFACE.



If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to
its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by
such permit or shall otherwise have failed to complete the excavation work
covered by such permit, the City, if the Public Works Department deems it
advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things necessary to
restore the street and to complete the excavation work.  The permittee shall
be liable for the total actual cost of the work, including general overhead
and administrative expenses.  The City shall have a cause of action for all
fees, expenses and amounts paid out and due it for this work.  The City
shall also enforce its rights under the permittee’s surety bond provided
pursuant to this chapter.  It shall be the duty of the permittee to
guarantee and maintain the paved portion of the street in the same condition
it was prior to the excavation for four (4) years after restoring it to its
original condition.



141.20  PROMPT COMPLETION OF WORK.



The permittee shall prosecute with diligence and expedition all excavation
work covered by the excavation permit.  The permittee shall promptly
complete such work and restore the street to its original condition, or as
near as may be, as soon as practicable and in any event not later than the
date specified in the excavation permit.  This provision shall not be
construed as prohibiting temporary closings.



141.21  URGENT WORK.



If in the judgment of the Public Works Department, traffic conditions, the
safety or inconvenience of the traveling public or the public interest
require that the excavation work be performed as emergency work, the Public
Works Department shall have full power to order, at the time the permit is
granted, that a crew of workers and adequate facilities be employed by the
permittee twenty-four (24) hours a day to the end that the excavation work
may be completed as soon as possible.



141.22  EMERGENCY ACTION.



In the event of any emergency in which a sewer, main, conduit or utility in
or under any street breaks, bursts or otherwise is in such condition as to
immediately endanger the property, life, health or safety of any individual,
the person owning or controlling such sewer, main, conduit or utility,
without first applying for and obtaining an excavation permit under this
chapter, shall immediately take proper emergency measures to cure or remedy
the dangerous conditions for the protection of property, life, health and
safety of individuals.  However, the person owning or controlling such
facility shall apply for an excavation permit not later than the end of the
next succeeding day during which the Public Works Department office is open
for business, and shall not proceed with permanent repairs to the street
paving without first obtaining an excavation permit under this chapter.



141.23  NOISE, DUST AND DEBRIS.



Each permittee shall conduct and carry out the excavation work in such manner
as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and
occupants of neighboring property.  The permittee shall take appropriate
measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable in the performance of
the excavation work, noise, dust and unsightly debris.  During the hours of
ten o’clock (10:00) p.m. and seven o’clock (7:00) a.m. the permittee
shall not use, except with the express written permission of the Public Works
Department or in case of an emergency as herein otherwise provided, any tool,
appliance or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to disturb the
sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property.



141.24  PRESERVATION OF MONUMENTS.



The permittee shall not disturb any surface monuments or hubs found on the
line of excavation work until ordered to do so by the Public Works Department.



141.25  INSPECTIONS.



1.   It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a
permit to provide timely notification to the Public Works Department that
such work is ready for inspection.  The Public Works Department may require
that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before
such inspection is desired.  Such request may be in writing or by telephone,
at the option of the Public Works Department.  No work shall be completed
without inspection by the Public Works Department.  The Public Works
Department may require the person doing the work to uncover or redo
uninspected work at the person’s cost so that proper and thorough
inspection can be made.



2.   It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by
this chapter to provide access to and means for proper inspection of such
work.



3.   In addition to the inspections required by this chapter, the Public
Works Department may require other inspections of any work to ascertain
compliance with the provisions of this Code and other laws which are enforced
by the Public Works Department.



4.   A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or
reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not
complete or when required corrections have not been made.  This provision is
not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is
rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter, but as
controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for inspection or reinspection.  The reinspection fee shall be equal to the
cost of the original excavation permit fee for the work.  In instances where
reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work
will be performed until the required fees have been paid.



5.   Inspections requested outside of normal business hours shall be
charged as additional fee.  The fee shall be based upon the actual cost to
the City for supervision, overhead, equipment, hourly wages and fringe
benefits of all the employees involved.



6.   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to projects or work
contracted directly with the City, or work accomplished by City departmental
employees as a part of authorized City projects or work.



141.26  MAINTAIN DRAWINGS.



Users of sub-surface street space shall maintain accurate drawings of such
installations.  A utility shall locate and mark locations of their
installations upon the request of the Public Works Department or other
permittee at no charge.  Corrected drawings shall be made available to the
Public Works Department after new installations, changes or replacements are
made, if requested.



141.27  NOT APPLICABLE TO CITY WORK.



The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to any excavation work
of the City under the direction of the Public Works Department at the request
of the City for the convenience of the City or by any contractor of the City
performing work for and on behalf of the City, necessitating openings or
excavations in streets.



141.28  INSURANCE.



The utility company shall hold the City harmless for any damages resulting
from the applicant’s operations.  A copy of a certificate of insurance
naming the City as an additional insured for the permitted work shall be
filed in the Public Works office prior to installation.  The minimum limits
of liability under the insurance policy shall be one million dollars
($1,000,000.00).



141.29  LIABILITY OF CITY.



This chapter shall not be construed as imposing upon the City or any official
or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any person injured
by the performance of any excavation work for which an excavation permit is
issued pursuant to this chapter; nor shall the City or any City official or
City employee be deemed to have assumed any such liability or responsibility
by reason of inspections authorized, the issuance of any permit or the
approval of any excavation work.

145.02  DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.



All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a
hazard to safety or health or public welfare, by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, as specified in this
chapter, the City Building Code or any other ordinance, are, for the purpose
of this chapter, unsafe buildings.  All such unsafe buildings are hereby
declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition or removal in accordance with the procedure
specified in this chapter.  “Unsafe building” means any structure or
mobile home meeting any or all of the following criteria:



1.   Whenever any portion or member or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, or to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property.



2.   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance, or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or
stability or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting a wind pressure of twenty (20) pounds per square foot.



3.   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled or settled
to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially
less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of
similar new construction.



4.   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof, because
of (i) dilapidation, deterioration or decay; (ii) faulty construction; (iii)
the removal, movement or instability of any portion of the ground necessary
for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the deterioration, decay or
inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause, is likely to collapse
partially or completely.



5.   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used.



6.   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members
list, lean or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the
center of gravity does not fall inside the middle one-fourth (1/4) of the
base.



7.   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the foundation,
shows thirty-three percent (33%) or more damage or deterioration of its
supporting member or members, or fifty percent (50%) damage or deterioration
of its non-supporting members, or of its enclosing or outside walls or
coverings.



8.   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind,
earthquake or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to
become (i) an attractive nuisance to children; (ii) a harbor for vagrants,
criminals or immoral persons; or (iii) as to enable persons to resort thereto
for the purpose of committing unlawful or immoral acts.



9.   Whenever a building or structure, used, or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, including lack of paint
so as to expose wood to rotting, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty
construction, or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation facilities,
or otherwise is determined by the County Health Officer to be unsanitary,
unfit for human habitation, or in such condition that is likely to cause
sickness or disease.



10.   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas
connections, or heating apparatus, or other cause, is determined by the State
Fire Marshal or City Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.



11.   Whenever any building or structure is in such a condition as to
constitute a public nuisance known to the common law or in equity
jurisprudence.



12.   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a site
after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever
any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six (6)
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.



13.   Whenever any deficiencies exist which are required to be provided
for residential tenancies under Chapter 562A of the Code of Iowa.



145.03  REMEDY CONCERNING UNSAFE BUILDINGS.



The Building Official shall examine, or cause to be examined, every building
or structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such
is found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the Building
Official shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof.  This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within forty-eight (48) hours or such
reasonable time as the circumstances require, to commence either the required
repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the building or
structure or portions thereof, and all such work shall be completed within
ninety (90) days from date of notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the
Building Official.  If necessary, such notice shall also require the
building, structure or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not
reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are completed,
inspected and approved by the Building Official.  Notice shall be served
upon the owner by certified mail, with return receipt requested.  If the
letter is returned as refused or undeliverable, the law considers notice to
have been given, and this section is satisfied.  Where there is no record of
the owner, the notice may be made by an ordinance.  The designated period
within which the owner or person in charge is required to comply with the
order of the Building Official shall begin as of the date the owner receives
such notice.  However, such notice shall, except in cases of immediate
danger, state that the person notified may request a hearing before the
Council concerning the determination that the building be repaired, removed
or demolished, and such request shall be made at least three (3) days before
the deadline set in the notice, if less than fifteen (15) days were set, at
least ten (10) days if over twenty-one (21) days were set.



1.   Posting Of Signs.  The Building Official shall cause to be posted at
each entrance to such building a notice to read:



DO NOT ENTER.  UNSAFE TO OCCUPY




Public Works Department, City of Pella




Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or
removal are completed.  Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the Building Official and no person shall enter the building
except for the purposes of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.



2.   Right To Demolish.  In case the owner fails, neglects or refuses to
comply with the notice to repair, rehabilitate or to demolish and remove the
building or structure or portion thereof, the City Council may order the
owner of the building prosecuted as a violator of the provisions of this
chapter and may order the Building Official to proceed with the work
specified in such notice.  A statement of the cost of such work shall be
transmitted to the Council.



3.   Costs.  Costs incurred under subsection 2 above shall be paid out of
the City Treasury.  Such costs shall be charged to the owner of the premises
involved and levied against the land on which the building or structure is
located, and shall be collected in the manner provided in Section
364.12(3)(h), Code of Iowa.

interfere with public utility lines, or which were planted or placed after
March 21, 1989, shall be removed within six (6) months upon written notice to
remove by the Public Works Director to the property owner.  If the property
owner refuses to remove the specified item, the Public Works Director may
order its removal and cause the City Clerk to assess the cost thereof against
the property owner in accordance with Section 364.12(2)(c), Code of Iowa. 
The property owner may appeal the decision of the Public Works Director to
the City Council.  The Public Works Director shall cause the item to be

authorized by such permit is not commenced within thirty (30) calendar days
from the date of issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is not
completed within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of issuance, unless,
because of the extensiveness of the project, the Building Official deems at

should be granted.



2.   Any permittee holding an unexpired demolition permit may request in
writing an extension of time within which the demolition work may be

Official may extend the applicable expiration date.



3.   Except as provided in this section, a demolition permit that has
expired shall be null and void, and before any demolition work is

that is the subject of a public nuisance action has expired, the Building
Official shall order the prompt removal of such structure, in accordance with
all requirements of this chapter.  All of the costs attendant to this
action, including administrative costs, shall be either assessed against the
property or collected from the owner unless otherwise directed by the Council.

6.   The applicant shall pay all utility disconnection fees.



155.05  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



1.   The Building Official or other City departments shall have the
authority to impose at any time reasonable requirements and safety
precautions in the interest of public safety, and welfare which, in the
opinion of the Building Official, are commensurate with the severity of the
hazard, either demonstrated or anticipated.



2.   The discharging, loading, or dumping of building materials from any
building shall be accomplished in such manner as to minimize the creation of
dust and scattering of debris.  Materials shall not be dropped by gravity to
any point lying outside the building walls except through an enclosed chute,
unless such materials are dust free and the height of drop is at least equal
to the horizontal distance to the nearest property or barricade line.  Where
such horizontal distance is not available and practicality and necessity
dictates the dropping of relatively large masses of materials, the Building
Official may approve appropriate protective measures designed to provide
protection from danger equivalent to that afforded by the otherwise
horizontal setback.  In all cases such materials shall be handled in a
manner approved by Federal, State and County requirements.



3.   When necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare,
every demolition project shall be barricaded, fenced, lighted, and signed
with warning and/or directional signs in a manner approved by the Building
Official and complying with MUTCD requirements.  Such barricades, fences,
lights, and signs shall be maintained after completion of the demolition work
until such time as the site is cleaned of all debris and all excavations,
basements, and depressions in the ground are restored to grade and rendered
harmless to the satisfaction of the Building Official.



4.   Adequate precautions shall be taken to ensure that procedures or
conditions relating to the demolition work do not constitute a fire hazard. 
If, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, a fire hazard exists or is likely to
exist, the Fire Chief may order the cessation of work or require that
appropriate protective measures approved by the Fire Chief be taken.



5.   All streets, alleys and public ways adjacent to the demolition site
shall be kept free and clear of any rubbish, refuse, dust and loose materials
resulting from the demolition work.



155.06  SITE REQUIREMENTS.



1.   The permittee shall obtain inspection and approval from the Code
Enforcement Officer prior to backfilling any excavations, holes or
depressions on the demolition site.  Visual verification and inspection that
all utilities have been properly disconnected shall be conducted prior to
placement of backfill material.  The permittee shall have on site the
demolition permit for review/verification by the Code Enforcement Officer
regarding utility disconnections.



2.   All foundations, walls, walks, concrete and/or other building
materials, rubbish or refuse shall be removed from the excavation depression
and the demolition  site.  Excavations, cellar holes, basement holes,
abandoned cisterns or other depressions on the demolition site shall be
removed and filled and compacted with earthen fill to match the density,
stability and grade of the adjacent undisturbed soils.  No fly ash or equal
is to be used.



3.   A tillable layer of topsoil shall be spread over the entire lot to a
uniform, natural grade consistent with adjacent grades that will prevent the
ponding of water.



4.   Adjacent grades means approximate existing elevation of the ground
surrounding a basement or other excavated or depressed area, at the distance
of 5 feet outside the property lines.



5.   In the event that the backfill materials are not of a consistency and
density to produce, support and maintain a stable, uniform grade, or if the
backfill materials were frozen when used, any settling of the backfill
material within 60 days of closeout of the project or 60 days after the
ground is free from frost shall be remedied by the permittee with additional
fill material or topsoil material that has been appropriately placed,
compacted and groomed.



6.   The permittee shall protect all adjacent property, private or public,
to avoid damage or injury to same, and shall repair or replace any
structures, vegetation or topography which was destroyed, damaged, moved or
changed in conjunction with, or by reason of the demolition operation.  Such
repairs, replacement or restitution shall be based upon the consistent grade,
appearance and state of repair, which existed prior to the commencement of
the demolition work.



7.   Prior to completion of the demolition operation, the site shall be
cleaned of all rubble, debris and refuse.  The soil shall be groomed and
appropriately seeded.



8.   If a building permit for the demolition site is not approved within
sixty (60) days after approved conclusion of the demolition project,
sidewalks for the property must be replaced.



9.   The surety deposit shall be returned to the permittee upon
verification that all requirements have been adhered to.  The surety deposit
will be cashed and used as payment for any bills or work required to
correctly conclude the project.



155.07  ABANDONED OR UNSAFE PROJECTS.



When a demolition project has been abandoned, or is found to be unsafe, the
Building Official may order the unsafe conditions corrected, the building
boarded up and the premises barricaded.  Upon failure of the owner or agent
to comply with the order of the Building Official within 7 days, the Building
Official, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may cause said building
or structure to be demolished to the extent of the work covered by the
demolition permit, the premises cleaned and suitable drainage grades
established, the cost of such demolition, cleaning and grading; the surety
deposit will be cashed and used to satisfy all required work, and any
additional expenses that exceed the surety amount shall be assessed to the
property as provided by Section 364.12(3) of the Code of Iowa.

165.13  SPECIAL AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS.



Special Districts provide for modified base districts that allow multiple
land uses and/or flexible development, with the requirement that a specific
plan for the area be submitted by applicants.  Overlay Districts are used in
combination with base districts to modify or expand base district
regulations.  Overlay Districts are adapted to special needs of different
parts of the City of Pella.  The Special and Overlay Districts are designed
to achieve one or more of the following objectives:



1.   To recognize special conditions in specific parts of the City which
require specific regulation.



2.   To provide flexibility in development and to encourage innovative
design through comprehensively planned projects.



3.   RPZ - Runway Protection Zone.  A Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) is
designed as a zoning overlay to protect the portion of the airport approach
closest to the airport from incompatible land uses where buildings and/or
concentrations of people associated with a specific use may otherwise be
present.  The RPZ is based on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) design
criteria.



   A.   Definition.  "Runway protection zone" means a trapezoidal area
off the end of the runway end that serves to enhance the protection of people
and property on the ground in the event an aircraft lands or crashes beyond
the runway end.

   B.   Permitted Uses.  Land shall be used only for one or more of
the following purposes consistent with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
regulations and guidelines:



      (1)     Agricultural uses including grazing and raising of
crops.



      (2)     Parks, parkways and other recreation uses which are
generally passive in nature and do not have buildings or concentrations of
people generally associated with them, including such uses as a recreational
trail, parkway, or other passive, non-intensive, open space uses.



      (3)     Utilities where such utilities would not conflict
with the Municipal Airport Height Regulations or otherwise pose significant
hazard in the event of a aircraft landing or crash in the RPZ.



   C.   Uses Permitted Through Special Use Permit.  The following uses
shall be permitted through special use permit and shall be consistent with
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and guidelines:



      (1)     Storm water detention facility where it is a dry
bottom design so as to not create wet habitat for wildlife.



   D.   Airport Relocation.  In the event that the current municipal
airport is relocated, then the RPZ shall be reestablished at the new location
and the current RPZ land use restrictions removed.

165.13.5    HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY ZONE.



1.   Historic District Overlay Zone: the historic district overlay (HD)
zone is used to designate local historic landmarks and historic districts. 
The purpose of the overlay zone is to:



   A.   Promote the educational, cultural, economic, and general
welfare of the public by protecting, enhancing, and perpetuating historic
landmarks and districts of historic architectural and cultural significance;



   B.   Safeguard the City's architectural, historic, and cultural
heritage by preserving historic buildings and neighborhoods;



   C.   Provide for design review of new construction, or alteration of
existing resources, to assure compatibility with the existing character of
historic neighborhoods and preserve the historic integrity of the resource;



   D.   Stabilize and improve property values by encouraging
reinvestment in historic neighborhoods;



   E.   Foster civic pride in the legacy and beauty of past
achievements; and



   F.   Protect and enhance the City's attractiveness to tourists and
visitors, thereby supporting and stimulating business.



2.   Authority: The City Council may designate by ordinance areas of the
City as historic districts or local historic landmarks.  The process of
designation is considered an overlay rezoning.  A historic district overlay
rezoning is required to designate historic districts and local historic
landmarks.  The process criteria include:



   A.   The process to rezone areas as a historic district shall follow
the requirements of Chapter 165.38 of the City of Pella's zoning code.  In
addition to the requirements of this code section, the application to rezone
property for a historic overlay district must contain signatures of the
owners of at least 50% of the total number of parcels of real estate within
the proposed district, excluding parcels owned by government bodies, provided
that each parcel, within the meaning of this subsection, shall constitute a
separate parcel for property tax 
assessment purposes, as shown in the records of the county assessor on the
date of the filing of the petition.  Furthermore, the application must also
contain signatures of owners of at least 50% of the total public street
frontage area within the proposed district, excluding public street frontage
abutting governmental property.  An application to rezone areas as a
historic district can be submitted by the City of Pella, the Historic
Preservation Commission, the Planning and Zoning Commission, or a property
owner from the proposed district.



   B.   Information must be included as supporting documentation so
that the Historic Preservation Commission can evaluate whether it meets the
criteria of this ordinance.  Supporting documentation may include, but not
be limited to, history, narrative, photos, maps, and a list of addresses with
age of structures.



   C.   Upon receiving a petition for a historic district overlay zone,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall review and determine if the
proposed district is eligible to form a historic overlay zone.  If the
Commission determines the proposed district is eligible, then the petition
shall be submitted to the Historical Division of the State Department of
Cultural Affairs for its report and recommendations. If the Historical
Division determines that the proposed district does not meet the requirements
of state law for designation as a historic district, no further action shall
be taken toward designation of the proposed district. The report and
recommendations of the Historical Division shall be made available for public
viewing at the office of the Planning and Zoning Department.  Review by the
Historical Division can occur before or after a public hearing before the
Historic Preservation Commission, but must be completed before consideration
by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   D.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public
hearing and review the proposed historic district as per criteria herein
established and forward a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council.



   E.   Public hearings and review at Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council shall follow the same procedures for rezoning pursuant to
165.38.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider whether the
proposed historic district generally conforms to the City's Comprehensive
Plan.



3.   Descriptions and Definitions:



   A.   Historic district overlay zones are geographically cohesive
areas with significant concentrations of buildings and other resources that
possess a high degree of historic integrity and convey a district sense of
time and place and that have been designated as a historic district by the
City Council pursuant to this ordinance.  To qualify for designation as a
historic district, the subject area must contain abutting pieces of property
under diverse ownership that meet approval criteria below.



      (1)   Are significant in American history, architecture,
archaeology, and culture; and



      (2)   Possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association; and



      (3)   Are associated with events that have been a significant
contribution to the patterns of our history; or



      (4)   Are associated with the lives of persons significant in
our past; or



      (5)   Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction, or represent the work of a master, or
possess high artistic values, or represent a significant and distinguishable
entity whose components may lack individual distinction;



      (6)   Have yielded or may be likely to yield information
important in prehistory or history.



   B.   A historic landmark is any building, structure, object, area of
land, or element of landscape architecture with significance, importance, or
value, consistent with the approval criteria listed above for historic
districts and that has been designated as a local historic landmark by the
City Council pursuant to the applicable procedures outlined herein.



4.   Designated Historic Districts:



   A.   The following areas of the City are designated as historic
districts:



   None yet established (this would entail a separate subsequent ordinance)



5.   Historic Review:



   A.   The intent of the historic review process is:



      (1)   To ensure that new construction or additions are
compatible with the architectural character of the historic district.



      (2)   To ensure that material changes to exterior features of
landmarks and properties in the historic districts do not substantially alter
or destroy the defining architectural character of a building, site, or
neighborhood.



      (3)   To provide property owners, contractors, and consultants
with technical assistance and design alternatives to ensure that proposed
projects conform to the applicable historic preservation guidelines.



   B.   Applicability: All properties within a historic district
overlay shall obtain a certificate of appropriateness for new construction,
demolition, and exterior alterations subject to historic review. The
requirements for historic review apply to the following as it pertains to
exterior items:



      (1)   New construction of single or two family homes or new
accessory buildings for any single family or two family homes in the historic
districts.



      (2)   Additions to existing structures in the historic
districts which require a building permit.



      (3)   Alterations to existing structures in the historic
districts which require a building permit or demolition permit.



      (4)   Alterations to existing structures in the historic
districts which do not require a building permit or demolition permit but are
visible from a public street or front of the structure do not require
historic review; however voluntary historic review is encouraged for such
alterations. These types of alterations are also exempt from the certificate
of appropriateness requirements.  Other alterations not visible from the
public street or front of the structure, and which do not otherwise need a
building permit, shall be exempt from historic review.



   C.   Approval Criteria: Applications for historic review for
contributing structures in the historic overlay zone will be in conformance
with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings.  All other structures
within a historic overlay zone will be reviewed in accordance with the Dutch
Residential Design Review District Guidelines.  Furthermore, it is the
intent of this article that the Commission shall be reasonable in its
judgments and shall endeavor to approve proposals for alteration of
structures of little historical, architectural, and cultural value, except
when such a proposal would seriously impair the historical values and
character of the surrounding area. Also, the Commission shall be sympathetic
to proposals utilizing energy saving modifications, such as solar panels.



   D.   Multi-family, Commercial, and Other Uses:  For properties
which have base zoning which permits multi-family, commercial, or other
non-residential uses, design review shall be conducted by the Community
Development Committee if said properties are in the Design Review Overlay
District pursuant to 165.16, prior to review by the Historic Preservation
Commission.  Otherwise, any said properties not subject to Community
Development Committee review, and located with historic district, shall be
subject to Historic Preservation Commission review as per this ordinance.



   E.   Appeals: Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Historic
Preservation Commission regarding an application for historic review in a
historic district, or for a historic landmark, may appeal the action to the
City Council.



6.   Compliance with Certificate Required: Issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness, certificate of no material effect, or a certificate of
economic hardship, is authorization to make only those material changes
specified in the approved application.  It shall be the duty of the Building
Official or designee to inspect, from time to time, any work performed
pursuant to such a certificate to ensure compliance with the requirements of
such certificate.  If it is found that such work is not being carried out in
accordance with the certificate, the Building Official shall issue a stop
work order.  Any material change at variance with that authorized by the
certificate shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and subject to
enforcement as allowed by the Pella City Code herein.



7.   Certificate of Economic Hardship: After receiving written
notification from the Historic Preservation Commission of the disapproval of
a certificate of appropriateness, the owner of record may apply for a
certificate of economic hardship if he or she believes that the application
of the provisions of this article would result in economic hardship to the
extent that the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return.  The
applicant bears the burden of proof and must support each of the approval
criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.  Criteria for economic hardship
including the following:



   A.   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
required to comply with the requirements and standards specified in this
article.  It is not sufficient to show that the potential return will be
reduced as a result of these regulations, but rather it must be demonstrated
that the resulting reduction would be near confiscation.



   B.   The owner's situation is unique or peculiar to the property in
question, and the situation is not shared with the other landowners in the
area, nor due to the general conditions in the neighborhood.



   C.   The hardship is not of the property owner's or applicant's own
making.



The Historic Preservation Commission shall review each case for economic
hardship request on a case by case basis taking into account the above
criteria, and also any other solutions that would alleviate the hardship,
while still meeting minimum criteria for historic review.  The Commission
may grant exception to adherence to the design criteria if it agrees the
criteria are met and no other solutions are reasonably available.



8.   Historical Landmarks.



   A.   For purpose of this article, a landmark or landmark site
designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved, including any
building, improvement, or structure located thereon that possesses integrity
of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and
association and that:



      (1)   Is significant in American history, architecture,
archaeology and culture;



      (2)   Is associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history;



      (3)   Is associated with the lives of persons significant in
our past;



      (4)   Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master, or
possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or



      (5)   Has yielded or may be likely to yield information
important in prehistory or history.



   B.   Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical
figures; properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious
purposes; structures that have been moved from their original locations;
reconstructed historic buildings; properties primarily commemorative in
nature; and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50
years shall not be considered eligible for the landmark designation. However,
such properties will qualify if they fall within the following categories:



      (1)   A religious property deriving primary significance from
architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance.



      (2)   A building or structure removed from its original
location which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is
the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or
event.



      (3)   A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of
outstanding importance, if there is no appropriate site or building directly
associated with his or her productive life.



      (4)   A cemetery which derives its primary significance from
graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive
design features, or from association with historic events.



      (5)   A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a
suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a
restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the
same association has survived.



      (6)   A property primarily commemorative in nature, if design,
age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical
significance.



      (7)   A property achieving significance within the past 50
years, if it is of exceptional importance.



   C.   The Historic Preservation Commission may adopt specific
operating guidelines for landmark and landmark site designations, providing
such are in conformity with this article.



   D.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall consider
applications for historical landmarks and make a recommendation to the
Planning and Zoning and Pella City Council as provided below.



      (1)   Before proceeding with an application for a historical
landmark, the owner of the property must approve the application.



      (2)   After review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
Pella City Council may approve a historical landmark designation for a
property located within the City's corporate limits by passing a resolution.



      (3)   If agreed to by the owner, at such time as a landmark or
landmark site has been properly recorded, the City Council may cause to be
prepared and erected on such property, at City expense, a suitable plaque
declaring that such property is a landmark or landmark site. Such plaque
shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing pedestrians. If a
landmark, the plaque shall state the accepted name of the landmark, the date
of its construction, and other information deemed proper by the City Council.
If a landmark site which is not the site of a landmark building, such plaque
shall state the common name of the site and such other information deemed
appropriate by the City Council.



   E.   In addition to those duties already specified in this article,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall individually and collectively:



      (1)   Work collaboratively with the property owner and State
Historic Preservation office in attempting to include such properties
designated as landmark or landmark sites on the National Register of Historic
Places.



      (2)   Work for the continuing education of the citizens of the
City about the historic heritage of this City and the landmark and landmark
sites designated under this article.



   F.   A landmark or landmark site designation may be amended or
rescinded by the same process as for the designation of a landmark.



9.   Property Maintenance Code Violations.



   A.   Except for emergencies as determined by the Building Official
pursuant to the Chapter 145 Dangerous Building and/or Chapter 156 Property
Maintenance Code, City enforcement agencies and departments must give the
Historic Preservation Commission at least thirty (30) days of notice of any
proposed order for remedying property maintenance code violations which may
affect the exterior features of any building or structure located in a
historic district or property that has been designated a historic landmark.



   B.   The Commission may require that material changes not adversely
affect the exterior features of a building in cases where the danger to life,
health, or property may be abated without detracting from the exterior
features of the building.  In such cases, it is the responsibility of the
Commission and the City enforcement agency or department to cooperate with
the property owner in an attempt to achieve a preservation solution whereby
the dangerous conditions will be corrected with minimal adverse impact on
exterior features.  Such plan shall be approved by the Commission and shall
be signed by the Chair of the Commission, the property owner and the head of
the City's enforcing agency or department.



   C.   If a solution acceptable to the Commission, the City
enforcement agency or department and the property owner cannot be reached
within thirty (30) days, or a period of time acceptable to the City
enforcement agency of department, the agency or department shall proceed to
issue and enforce its proposed order as provided for by City Code.



10.   Prevention of Demolition by Neglect.



   A.   Duty to Maintain: All buildings and structures that contribute
to a historic district must be preserved against decay, deterioration, and
kept free from structure defects by the owner or such person, persons, or
entities who may have custody or control thereof.  Accordingly, all such
buildings and structures must be maintained in accordance with the City of
Pella Property Maintenance Code.  This same standard applies for all
properties receiving a historical landmark designation by the Pella City
Council.



   B.   Determination and Action: The Historic Preservation Commission
may file a petition with the Building Official requesting investigation of
any applicable building or structure suspected of neglect or deterioration
according to the Property Maintenance Code.  The Building Official will
proceed with investigation and may take any enforcement action necessary and
allowed by law to correct or prevent further violation.



   C.   Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the property owner(s) or
other responsible person(s) duly notified to take the corrective action(s)
specified by the Building Official with the time allotted, the Building
Official may proceed with enforcement as provided by the City of Pella Code
and Property Maintenance Code provisions therein.

165.14  PUD – PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.



A Planned Unit Development (hereinafter “PUD”) is designed to allow for
comprehensively planned projects which provide for innovative and imaginative
approaches to urban design and land development.  A PUD is a negotiated
contract for land development between the private developer and the public
governmental entity.  This differs from the traditional approach to land
development wherein the developer develops the land pursuant to minimum
standards previously adopted by the government.  A PUD permits flexible
variation from established land regulations as contained in zoning districts
and in platting and subdivision requirements.  When an area of land is
developed under this section, various provisions of the platting and
subdivision requirements may be waived, zoning district requirements
pertaining to area, height and spacing may be modified, and various land use
mixtures may be permitted with appropriate screening, landscape buffers and
setback restrictions.  In essence, the developer, with City staff guidance,
Planning and Zoning Commission review, and Council approval, may develop its
own guidelines for the best development of the land in question.  However,
it is not the intent of this section either to permit a mixture of totally
unrelated uses to be developed or to allow the fundamental purposes of the
zoning, platting and subdivision provisions of this Code to be ignored.  It
is the intent of this section to permit the establishment of unified
developments with differing land uses arranged so as to be compatible with
one another, with the site to be developed, and with the surrounding area. 
In no event shall the basic purpose or intent of the zoning, platting and
subdivision provisions of this Code of Ordinances be violated.



1.   Applicability.  A PUD is an overlay of agreed upon development
standards intended to work in conjunction with established zoning, platting
and subdivision regulations.



2.   Design Standards.  A PUD shall be planned as an integral unit and
may consist of residential, commercial and/or industrial land uses.  When
different land uses are used in a PUD, the development shall be designed to
be compatible with adjacent areas.  A PUD shall meet all zoning, platting
and subdivision requirements unless those requirements are specifically
addressed and amended in the approving ordinance.  The following design
standards apply to a PUD:



   A.   Environmental Design.  Existing trees, groves, waterways,
scenic points, historic spots, and other natural assets and landmarks shall
be preserved whenever possible.  The location of trees shall be considered
when designing open spaces and planning the location of buildings,
underground services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas and
finished grade levels.  Excessive site clearing of topsoil, trees and
natural features shall be discouraged.  A general landscaping plan shall be
required for all PUDs.



   B.   Open Space.  The maintenance of public/common open space shall
be encouraged.  In the case of a large residential and/or commercial
development, open space may be required.  However, any requirement for open
space shall not exceed more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total land
area involved in the development.



   C.   Building Spacing.  Each development shall provide reasonable
visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units.  Fences, insulation,
walks, barriers and other landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the
protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its
occupants, the screening of objectionable views or uses, and the reduction of
noise.  High-rise buildings included within a PUD shall be located in such a
way so as to minimize any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings and
any invasion of privacy of the occupants of such low-rise buildings.



   D.   Traffic Circulation.  Principal vehicular access points shall
be designed to permit smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements
and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.  Streets within a
PUD shall be connected to streets outside of the PUD so as not to encourage
the use of the streets within the PUD by through traffic.



      (1)   The pedestrian circulation system and its related
walkways shall be separate from the vehicular street system when possible.



      (2)   All nonresidential land uses within a PUD shall have
direct access to a public street or frontage road.



      (3)   Standards of design and construction for roadways within
residential areas of PUDs shall be equivalent to those standards provided in
the Subdivision Ordinance.  It is expected that all roadways within a PUD
will be dedicated to the public.  However, in the case where residential
streets within a PUD are not expected to be connected to other roadways
outside the PUD, private ownership of roadways shall comply with minimum
street frontage requirements of this chapter.  No privately owned roadways
may be dedicated to the public use at a later date unless and until said
roadways have been improved by the private owner thereof to then existing
design standards for public streets.



   E.   Community Services.  PUD approvals shall not be granted unless
utility systems such as water lines, sanitary sewer lines and streets located
outside the PUD exist in sufficient quantity and quality to serve the PUD
without system overload, unless the developer agrees to sufficiently improve
the system deemed inadequate at the developer’s own expense.



   F.   Market Analysis.  A market analysis may be required for any
PUD project.  The market analysis shall contain the following determinations:



      (1)   Determination of the trade area of the proposed
commercial facilities.



      (2)   Determination of the trade area population, both present
and prospective.



      (3)   Determination of the effective buying power in such
trade area.



      (4)   Determination of net potential customer buying power for
stores in the proposed commercial facilities and, on such basis, the
recommended store types and store floor areas.



      (5)   Determination of the residual amount of buying power in
the trade area and how it may be expected to be expended in other business
areas serving the trade area.



3.   Administration.  By its nature, a PUD involves the negotiation of a
development contract between the private and public interests.  A proposed
PUD should comply with all platting and zoning requirements of the City or,
in the alternative, should address those requirements for which modification
is sought.



   A.   Private Developer.  The private developer is the developer or
a designated representative of the developer who is authorized to negotiate
the terms of a PUD with regard to a specific parcel of land.  It is intended
that the negotiation, review and approval process of a PUD avoid confusion
and undue hardship for both the developer and the public entity. 
Negotiation meetings between the private developer and the City staff are
recommended so that an understanding and mutual consensus on the proposed PUD
may be reached to the extent possible prior to the formal filing for PUD
approval.



   B.   City Staff.  City staff shall be a professional committee
composed of representatives from planning, engineering, and other public
service providers as designated by the City Administrator.  The staff’s
function shall be to review proposed PUDs, analyze their impact, and
negotiate standards needed to maintain quality development in an urban
environment.  After a private developer has formally filed a proposed PUD
with the planning department, the staff shall have forty-five (45) days to
review the PUD in detail, convey their findings and recommendations in
writing to the Planning and Zoning Commission, and start the public hearing
process.



   C.   Planning and Zoning Commission.  Upon referral of a proposed
PUD from the staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall do the following:



      (1)   Determine if the proposed PUD is in conformance with
adopted City plans and the intent of platting, subdivision and zoning
regulations.



      (2)   Review the proposed PUD for appropriateness the same as
is done with any rezoning request.



      (3)   Review staff recommendations and consider any differing
viewpoints between the developer, staff or citizens concerning the proposed
PUD.



      (4)   Hold a public hearing to receive citizen input and
concerns.



      (5)   Make any recommendations to the private developer it
deems appropriate.



      (6)   Make recommendations to the City Council based upon its
findings.  Within thirty (30) days after public hearing, the Commission
shall recommend either: approval as filed; approval subject to specific
conditions as listed; or denial based upon findings.



   D.   City Council.  The City Council shall be the final authority
for approval or disapproval of a proposed PUD, and shall have the authority
to waive or modify Code requirements and adopt land development standards so
as to facilitate desirable PUDs.  The City Council shall hold a public
hearing to hear citizen input and concerns.  Approval of a PUD shall be by
ordinance.  The ordinance shall set forth the legal description of the
property included within the PUD, incorporate by reference the plans, maps,
reports, and conditions that comprise the PUD, and specify those provisions
of the Code which are waived or modified as part of the PUD.  If the private
developer fails to begin construction of the PUD within one year of the
effective date of the ordinance, approval of the PUD shall be considered null
and void and the City Council shall delete the ordinance.



   E.   Phase Development.  PUDs may be designed to be developed as a
single project or in separate phases.  If the private developer does not
complete the approved PUD within its scheduled time period, the City Council
shall review the progress of the PUD and may extend time schedules, amend the
PUD, or revoke portions of the PUD that are not completed.



   F.   Construction.  Project construction plans and progress shall
be reviewed by City staff to determine if City Code requirements and the
adopting ordinance are being met.  Minor changes in site engineering,
building design and location arrangement may be authorized by City staff. 
Substantial and material changes in the PUD must be approved by ordinance by
the City Council following Planning and Zoning Commission review and public
hearing.  The Building Official shall not issue a building permit for any
structure not permitted in the underlying zone until the City Council has
approved the PUD.  In accordance with the Design Review provisions of this
Code, a permit for any structure in a Design Review or Dutch Residential
Overlay District shall not be issued until the Community Development
Committee has approved the exterior design.  Prior to the issuance of any
building permit, all required and/or negotiated improvements shall be
completed.  Where there is no provision in the approved PUD addressing a
specific regulation or situation, the requirements of the most restrictive
conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or structure is
permitted shall be applied to the development.



4.   Filing Procedure.  The developer shall initiate formal action on a
PUD by filing an application for a PUD with the Planning and Zoning
Department.  The application shall be on a form provided by the Planning
Department and shall include the following:



   A.   Site Plan and Supporting Drawings.  A site plan and drawings
necessary to show the major details of the proposed PUD shall contain the
following information:



      (1)   The existing site conditions, including contours,
watercourses, floodplains (100-year flood evaluation), unique natural
features, and forest cover.



      (2)   Proposed lot lines and plot designs.



      (3)   The location and floor area size of all existing and
proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements, including maximum

structures, including commercial, industrial and public facilities.



      (4)   The location and size in acres or square feet of all
areas to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open space, public
parks, recreational areas, school sites and similar public and semipublic
uses.



      (5)   The existing and proposed circulation system of
arterial, collector and local streets including off-street parking areas,
service areas, loading areas and major points of access to public
rights-of-way including major points of ingress and egress to the development.



      (6)   The existing and proposed pedestrian circulation system,
including its interrelationship with the vehicular circulation system,
indicating proposed treatments of points of conflict.



      (7)   The existing and proposed utility systems, including
sanitary sewers, water, electric, gas and telephone lines.



      (8)   A general landscape plan indicating the treatment of
materials to be used for private and common open spaces.



      (9)   Sufficient information as to land areas adjacent to the
proposed PUD to indicate the relationship between the proposed development
and adjacent areas, including land uses, zoning classifications, densities,
circulation systems, public facilities and unique natural features of the
landscape.



      (10)   The proposed treatment of the perimeter of the PUD,
including materials and techniques to be used such as screens, fences and
walls.



      (11)   Any additional information required by City staff
deemed necessary to evaluate the character and impact of the proposed PUD.



   B.   Written Documents.  The following written documents shall be
required to be submitted in connection with the PUD application.



      (1)   A legal description of the development site, including a
statement of ownership and proposed zoning.



      (2)   A development schedule indicating the approximate date
when construction of the PUD or stages of the PUD can be expected to begin
and be completed.



      (3)   A market analysis may be required to be submitted so as
to justify the type and size of the prospect which can be realistically
supported in the community.



      (4)   A copy of the proposed covenants and other provisions or
restrictions proposed in the PUD.



      (5)   A detailed description of the ownership of and
responsibilities involved in the utility and street systems.



   C.   Miscellaneous.  Because the PUD provides the opportunity for
higher densities, greater design flexibility, mixed land uses, and improved
marketability, the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and
services as part of the PUD that might not be required or possible in a
conventional development.



   D.   Filing Fee.  The applicant shall submit a filing fee in the
amount shown on the schedule of rates and fees in Chapter 171 of this Code of
Ordinances with the formal PUD application.  The filing fee for an amendment
to a PUD is also given on said schedule in Chapter 171.



165.15  FP – FLOOD PLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.



1.   Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact and Purpose.



   A.   Statutory Authority.  The Legislature of the State of Iowa has
in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to
enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health
and the general welfare of the community.  Compliance with Title 44, Chapter
I, Part 67, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1361 of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)'s
Regulations (latest revised addition and addendum) in whole; and in
particular Paragraph 60.3(b) as administered by the Department of Homeland
Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are adopted as City of
Pella rules and regulations.   



(Ord. 759 - Sept. 07 Supp.)



   B.   Findings of Fact.



      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Pella, Iowa, are
subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare of the community.



      (2)   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects
are caused by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the
cumulative effect of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities.



   C.   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to
protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of
Pella, Iowa, and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety,
health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing
those flood losses described in paragraph 1(B)(1) of this section with
provisions designed to:



      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities.



      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction or substantial improvement.



      (3)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be
suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.



      (4)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property
owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National
Flood Insurance Program.



2.   General Provisions.



   A.   Lands to Which Ordinance Apply.  The provisions of this
section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of
Pella, Iowa, which are located within the boundaries of the Flood Plain
(Overlay) District as established in subsection 3.



   B.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Plain (Overlay) District. 
The boundaries of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District areas shall be
determined by scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Planning and Zoning Director shall make the necessary interpretation.  The
Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that
there is an error  in any requirement, decision, or determination  made
by  the  Planning and Zoning Director in the enforcement or administration
of this section.



   C.   Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereafter be used and
no structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this section.



   D.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  It is not intended by
this section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants,
or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provision of this section shall prevail.  All other
ordinances inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent
of the inconsistency only.



   E.   Interpretation.  In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.



   F.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The standards required
by this section are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes.  This
section does not imply that areas outside the designated Flood Plain
(Overlay) District areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This
section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Pella, Iowa, or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that from reliance on
this section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.



3.   Establishment of Flood Plain (Overlay) District.  The areas within
the jurisdiction of the City of Pella, Iowa having special flood hazards are
hereby designated as a Flood Plain (Overlay) District and shall be subject to
the standards of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District (as well as those for the
underlying zoning district).  The Flood Plain (Overlay) District boundaries
shall be described by the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Marion County and Incorporated Areas, City of
Pella, Panels 19125C0212D, 0214D, 0216D, 0217D, 0218D, 0236D, 0250D, dated
February 16, 2018.



(Ord.932 - Jun. 18 Supp.)



4.   Standards for Flood Plain (Overlay) District.  All uses must be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following
applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood elevation and floodway
data have not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determination.



(Ord.932 - Jun. 18 Supp.)



   A.   All Development.  All development within the Flood Plain
(Overlay) District shall:



      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.



      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will
minimize flood damage.



      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that
are resistant to flood damage.



      (4)   Obtain all other necessary permits from Federal, State
and local governmental agencies including approval when required from the

   B.   Residential Buildings.



      (1)   All new or substantially improved residential structures
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one
(1) foot above the 100-year flood level.  Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft. above the
100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon.



      (2)   Alternate methods of elevating, such as piers, may be
allowed subject to favorable consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where
existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by
fill.  In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the
structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with
flooding.



   All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of access
which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.



   C.   Non-residential Buildings.



      (1)   All new or substantially improved non-residential
buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum
of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level, or together with attendant
utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level.



      (2)   When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 100-year
flood; and that the structure, below the 100-year flood level is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North
American Vertical Datum) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator.



(Ord.932 - Jun. 18 Supp.)



   D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.



      (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not
including basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria:



         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.



         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one (1) foot above grade.



         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.



      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access and low damage potential storage.



      (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.



      (3)   New and substantially improved structures must be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.



   E.   Factory-Built Homes.  All new and substantially improved
factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-built home
parks, planned unit developments, or subdivisions, shall be:



      (1)   Elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the structure is a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood
level.



      (2)   Anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.



(Ord.932 - Jun. 18 Supp.)



   F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.



      (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from
the system during flooding.



      (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the

   C.   Variance.



      (1)   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this section that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this section will result in unnecessary
hardship.  Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.



         a.   Variances shall only be granted upon:  (i) a
showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.



         b.   Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.



         c.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
section, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that:  (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.



      (2)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of
Adjustment Shall Be Based.  In passing upon applications for variances, the
Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this
section and:



         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased
flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.



         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other
land or downstream to the injury of others.



         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems
and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions.



         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



         e.   The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the City.

subject to flooding for the proposed use.



         h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.



         i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the
Comprehensive Plan and flood plain management program for the area.



         j.   The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.



         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of
rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.

purpose of this section.



      (3)   Conditions Attached to Variances.  Upon consideration
of the factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose of this section.  Such conditions may include, but not necessarily
be limited to:



         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply
facilities.



         b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.

165.16  DR – DESIGN REVIEW DISTRICT.



   The (DR) Design Review District is intended to preserve and promote
"Dutch Architecture" for commercial businesses.  Development in the DR
District must accommodate design and architectural parameters that are
consistent with the heritage of the community.  These architectural themes
promote Pella as an attractive and unique community.



   1.   Permitted Uses.  Uses permitted in the DR Design Review
Overlay District are those permitted in the underlying base district.



   2.   Applicability.  A design review permit is required for the
following activities:



      A.   Any new commercial building within the DR District, or
any existing commercial building within the DR District for which
architectural detail modifications are proposed, shall be reviewed for
architectural compliance to Dutch Architectural themes or other historical
significance.  Architectural detail modifications subject to review include
any construction, maintenance, repair, alterations, modifications, painting,
repainting, signs, graphics, visual displays, outdoor furniture and fixtures.



      B.   A design review permit is not required for any structure
that is painted or repainted when the color used is the same as the color
approved in the original building or design permit.



      C.   The replacement of outdoor furniture, fixtures and visual
displays that are consistent with a prior permit shall be exempt from a
design review permit.



      D.   Single or two-family residential uses in a commercial
zoned area are exempted from design review unless they are located in a DURE
Overlay District.



   3.   Community Development Committee Review.  A design permit is
reviewed by a committee comprised of nine (9) members, who are appointed by
the City Council.  The committee shall be known as the Community Development
Committee.  Each member shall be appointed for a term of three (3) years and
shall be eligible for reappointment.  A Chairperson shall be chosen from the
members to serve for one year.  The Chairperson can be reelected provided
that no more than three (3) consecutive years have been served.  The
Committee shall meet at least once a month or more frequently as required to
adequately fulfill any required duties.



      A.   The Committee shall advise the Building Official
concerning all applications for building permits or design permits within the
Design Review District, and to act in an advisory capacity to the City
Council and the Mayor in all matters pertaining in the development of the
Business District.



      B.   The Community Development Committee shall have the
authority to inform the various departments of the City of any violations
regarding architectural details, materials or colors.  The Committee shall
recommend to these departments appropriate action in compliance with current
ordinances that are in force at the time of violation; subject to appeal
procedures.



      C.   The Committee shall have the authority to review design
permits for the placement, repair, alterations, modification, painting or
repainting of any sign, graphic, visual display or outdoor furniture or
fixtures, and to make recommendations to the various departments of the City
concerning such requests.



      D.   The Community Development Committee shall not have the
authority to bind the City by contract.



   A design permit shall be required for any change of use from
residential to commercial in the Design Review District.



   4.   Building/Design Permits.



      A.   Whenever application is made for a building/design permit
for any building within the Design Review District, the Building Official
shall refer said application, together with the plan and specifications for
the proposed work, to the Committee for its recommendations.



      B.   The Committee shall review the proposed plans and
specifications.  The review shall include the proposed appearance, colors,
texture, materials and architectural design of the exterior, including the
front, sides, rear and roof of said building, and also including all parts of
the building that are in a visual line from all areas or any alterations,
modification or repair or any courtyard, fence or dependency thereof.  The
Design Review District Design Manual shall be used by both the applicant and
the Committee for determining permitted Dutch architectural elements and
colors.  Architectural elements or colors which are not specifically
identified in the Design Review District Design Manual may only be used upon
approval of the Community Development Committee.  After due consideration,
the Committee shall promptly report to the Building Official its
recommendations, including such changes, if any, as in the judgment of the
Committee are reasonably necessary to comply with the requirements of this
section.  The Building Official shall take no action on the application for
a permit until the expiration of fourteen (14) days or until the Building
Official has received the recommendation of the Committee in writing,
whichever occurs first.



      C.   The Committee shall also review the proposed plans and
specifications, so far as they relate to the placement, alteration,
modifications, repair of any signs, graphic, visual display, outdoor
furniture of fixtures with respect to the appearance, colors, texture,
materials and architecture and design factors of the sign, visual display,
outdoor furniture or fixture, including all parts of same that are visible
from all areas.



   5.   Building/Design Permit Denial.  If the Committee recommends
denial of a building/design permit, said recommendation must be delivered to
the Building Official, who shall notify the applicant that the
building/design permit shall not be issued and the reason therefor.  The
Building Official may proceed with issuance of a building/design permit upon
amendment of the application to conform with the recommendations of the
Committee pursuant to the powers and duties of the Building Official.  Any
person denied a building/design permit by the Building Official pursuant to
the recommendation of the Committee may appeal the denial within thirty (30)
days after notification of the denial to the City Council.



   6.   Violations and Penalties.  Any person who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or who resists enforcement of any
of the provisions of this section, upon conviction, shall be in violation of
this Code of Ordinances and subject to penalty for each offense.  Proceeding
with any construction work or repair work requiring a permit without applying
for a permit shall be considered an offense and punishable by the provisions
of this section.  All departments, officials and employees of the City who
are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall
issue no such permit or license for any use, structure or purpose if the same
would not conform to the provisions of this section.



   7.   Commercial Zoning District Rezoning.  Any land rezoned to a
commercial zoning district or annexed into the corporate limits as a
commercial zoning district shall be concurrently rendered part of the DR
Design Review Overlay District.  The boundaries of the DR Design Review
Overlay District shall be the same as the boundaries of the land that is
being rezoned commercial.



   8.   Extraterritorial Zoning.  Any land rezoned to a commercial
zoning district as part of extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction shall be
rendered part of the DR Design Review Overlay District concurrent with the
adoption of extraterritorial zoning.



(Ord. 912 - Dec. 16 Supp.)



165.17  DURE – DUTCH RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.



   The (DURE) Dutch Residential District is intended to preserve and
promote "Dutch Architecture" for new residential developments as well as to
promote the long-term enhancement of residential properties in two areas of
the community: (1) in and around the Central Business District (CBD), and (2)
along Pella's Gateway Corridors (GC).  These two subdistricts of the DURE
District shall be referenced as DURE-CBD and DURE-GC. Development in the DURE
District must accommodate design and architectural parameters that are
consistent with the heritage of the community.  These architectural themes
promote Pella as an attractive and unique community.



   1.   Permitted Uses.  Uses permitted in the DURE Dutch Residential
District are those permitted in the underlying base district.



   2.   Properties Subject to DURE Review.  The properties subject to
DURE-CBD review is established as the former DURE central business district
area. The properties subject to DURE-GC review are those properties in the
West Washington Street west of the DURE-CBD to the City limits and Washington
Street east of the DURE-CBD to Hazel Street; Main Street including south of
the DURE-CBD to Oskaloosa Street in the South Main Street portion and north
of the DURE-CBD to Elm Street; all of said areas part of the Gateway Corridor
(GC) Overlay District areas that have frontage on those two streets and are
either currently in residential use or on which residential buildings can be
built under the current zoning. 



   3.   Applicability.  A design review permit is required for the
following activities: 



      A.   Any new residential building (building used for
residential purposes) or residential building addition, residential accessory
structure, a fence or wall associated with a structure used for residential
purposes, or architectural modifications to existing residential buildings
within the DURE District shall be reviewed for architectural compliance to
Dutch Architectural themes.  Architectural modifications for which design
review is required include any construction, maintenance, repair,
alterations, modifications, painting, or repainting.



      B.   A design permit is not required for any structure that is
painted or repainted when the color used is the same as the color approved in
the original building or design permit.



      C.   Exemptions.  Residences in existence at the time of
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance are hereby exempted from all the provisions
of the DURE District.  This exemption shall in no way exempt residential
structures used for commercial purposes in commercial districts from the
Design Review District requirements.  Further, in such cases where an
existing residence is demolished or destroyed and a new residential structure
is to be constructed, all the requirements of the DURE District shall apply.



   4.   Design Permits.  A design permit for the DURE District is
reviewed by the Community Development Committee and Building Official
following the same procedure as specified for a Design Review District design
permit. Whenever application is made for a design permit for any building
within the Dutch Residential District, the Building Official shall refer said
application, together with the plan and specifications for the proposed work,
to the Committee for its recommendations.  The Committee shall review the
proposed plans and specifications.  The review shall include the proposed
appearance, colors, texture, materials and architectural design of the
exterior, including the front, sides, rear and roof of said building, and
also including all parts of the building that are in a visual line from all
areas or any alterations, modification or repair or any courtyard, fence or
dependency thereof.  The Dutch Residential Design Manual shall be used by
both the applicant and the Committee for determining permitted Dutch
architectural elements and colors.  Architectural elements, colors or
building styles which are not specifically identified in the Dutch
Residential Design Manual may only be used upon approval by the Community
Development Committee.  After due consideration, the Committee shall
promptly report to the Building Official its recommendations, including such
changes, if any, as in the judgment of the Committee are reasonably necessary
to comply with the requirements of this section.  The Building Official
shall take no action on the application for a permit until the expiration of
fourteen (14) days or until the Building Official has received the
recommendation of the Committee in writing, whichever occurs first.



   5.   DURE District Setbacks and Lot Coverage.  Within the DURE-GC
subdistrict, the front yard setback and other bulk regulations shall be
pursuant to the underlying base zoning district and Gateway Corridor Overlay
District standards, including Section 165.18 D(4). Within the DURE-CBD
subdistrict, the intent of allowing lesser setbacks and smaller lot sizes
than would otherwise be required by the underlying base zoning district is to
develop in a manner that is more consistent with urban residential
developments in the Netherlands which often have minimal setbacks and are in
relatively close proximity compared to American standards.  The following
setbacks and lot coverage standards shall apply to all new residential
construction in the DURE-CBD subdistrict except in the following situations:



      A.   Where the front setback has generally been already
established by adjacent residential or commercial buildings.  In such
instances, the average front yard setback of structures within 200 feet shall
apply.  All other setback requirements and minimum green space requirements
shall still apply if applicable per this section.



      B.   Where the setbacks listed below would require a greater
setback than the base underlying zoning district requires (example: requiring
a 3'6" side yard setback where no side yard setback is required by the
underlying base zoning).



      C.   Where a new subdivision or residential development is
being created in the DURE-CBD subdistrict and the Community Development
Committee determines that other setback and lot coverage standards are
acceptable while still consistent with Pella's Dutch heritage and the
character of Dutch residential neighborhoods in the Netherlands.  In no
case, however, shall any setback or lot coverage standards determined by the
Committee be more stringent than those of the underlying base district
(example: requiring a larger setback than would be required in the underlying
base zoning district). 



      D.   Where the lot for new residential construction in the
DURE-CBD subdistrict is an existing lot of record at the time of adoption of
this zoning ordinance and there is no resubdivision or replatting of land as
part of the new residential construction.  In such cases, the
minimum/maximum lot frontage requirements and the minimum lot area
requirements of the DURE-CBD subdistrict shall not apply.  Setback
requirements shall still apply where applicable per this section.

   6.   DURE District Garages and Other Accessory Structures.



      A.   Garages and other accessory structures for one-family
structures are permitted only on the side of the building footprint area
facing the rear yard.  In no case shall a garage or accessory structure be
located closer to the rear property line or alley than five (5) feet. 
Parking for one-family residences shall be in a garage or hard-surfaced
parking area situated to the rear of the main structure with access to an
alley.  Existing lots of record at the time of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance, including resubdivisions thereto, are exempt from the alley
requirement when no alley is accessible.  The preferred alternative in this
situation is to locate the garage or parking area to the rear of the main
structure, accessed from the street by a driveway alongside the house.  If
this is not feasible, an attached garage can be considered, provided the
garage is recessed a minimum of five feet behind the front facade. The intent
is that the garage not be the dominant element of the façade.



      B.   Garages for duplex, townhouse and multi-family structures
are also preferred to be located in the rear yard, accessed by a driveway
alongside the dwelling. If this arrangement is not feasible, garages may be
permitted on the front side of the structure facing the street provided that
they are attached to the main structure and have a minimum recess of five
feet behind the front facade.  The intent is that the garage not be the
dominant element of the façade.



   7.   Design Permit Denial.  If the Committee recommends denial of a
design permit, said recommendation must be delivered to the Building
Official, who shall notify the applicant that the design permit shall not be
issued and the reason therefor.  The Building Official may proceed with
issuance of a design permit upon amendment of the application to conform with
the recommendations of the Committee pursuant to the powers and duties of the
Building Official.  Any person denied a design permit by the Building
Official pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee may appeal the
denial within thirty (30) days after notification of the denial to the City
Council.



   8.   Violations and Penalties.  Any person who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or who resists enforcement of any
of the provisions of this section, upon conviction, shall be in violation of
this Code of Ordinances and subject to penalty for each offense.  Proceeding
with any construction work or repair work requiring a permit without applying
for a permit shall be considered an offense and punishable by the provisions
of this section.  All departments, officials and employees of the City who
are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall
issue no such permit or license for any use, structure or purpose if the same
would not conform to the provisions of this section.



(Ord. 912 - Dec. 16 Supp.)



165.18  GATEWAY CORRIDOR DISTRICT.



The Gateway Corridor Overlay District is intended to provide special
regulations to assure that new developments along the primary entry corridors
into Pella, especially in and near the downtown, respect the existing
community character and foster pedestrian-oriented design.

   A.   Landscaping shall be in accordance with the provisions of
Section 165.31, Landscaping and Screening Requirements.



   B.   Parking areas shall be located along the side of buildings or
in the rear of the building.  In no case shall off-street parking be allowed
in any front yard setback or in the front of buildings except for the
following:



      (1)   Existing industrial parking areas in the front of
buildings or required front yards are exempt from this requirement, including
additions to existing industrial parking areas.



      (2)   New industrial parking areas may be located in the front
of buildings or in the required front yard provided that berming and a Type A

District areas on Washington Street from West 5th Street to East 2nd Street
and on Main Street from Washington Street south to Oskaloosa Street:



      (1)   Setback.  The maximum building setback from the public
right-of-way shall be based on the average of setbacks within 200' on both
sides of the property or 20', whichever is less. 



      (2)   Residential to Commercial Conversions. 



         a.   The total square footage (building footprint area)
of any building converted to commercial use from a residential use shall not
exceed 125% of the average of the square footage of residential buildings
(existing and formerly residential) within one block on both sides of the
property in question.  Building additions or expansion to said structures
shall only be permitted if the total square footage of the structure does not
exceed the above determined average.  In the event that the total square
footage of an existing residential structure exceeds the average as
determined above, then a conversion to commercial use may still occur
provided that there is no addition or enlargement of said structure.



         b.   Off-street parking areas which abut residential
uses or residential districts shall be screened with a Type A Screen per
Section 165.31 of this chapter.



         c.   A building permit and a design permit are both
required for any residential to commercial conversion.  The applicant shall
indicate any proposed modifications to the exterior of the building and the
overall site, including but not limited to building additions, alterations,
repainting, signage, parking, site lighting and landscaping.



      (3)   New Commercial Construction. 



         a.   The total square footage (building footprint area)
of any new commercial building shall not exceed 125% of the average of the
square footage of buildings within one block on both sides of the property in
question.  Commercial building additions or expansions for commercial
buildings constructed after the date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance
shall only be permitted if the total square footage of the structure does not
exceed the above determined average. 



         b.   Off-street parking areas which abut residential
uses or residential districts shall be screened with a Type A Screen per
Section 165.31 of this chapter.



         c.   A building permit and a design permit are both

existing Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall automatically be extended to
the City boundary line concurrent with any annexation.



3.   Extraterritorial Zoning and Gateway Corridor Overlay District
Extension.  An existing Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall
automatically be extended to the outer boundary of any extraterritorial
zoning jurisdiction concurrent with the adoption of extraterritorial zoning.



165.19  SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS - PURPOSE.



The Supplemental Use Regulations set forth additional standards for certain
uses located within the various zoning districts.  These regulations
recognize that certain use types have characteristics that require additional
controls in order to protect public health, safety, and welfare.  These
regulations complement the use regulations contained in Section 165.12 of
this chapter.  The regulations contained in this section pertain both to
uses allowed by right within various zoning districts; and to uses that
require approval as special uses by the Board of Adjustment.  Nothing
contained in this section shall limit the right of the Board of Adjustment to
impose additional conditions on developments seeking special use approval.



165.20  SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS – AGRICULTURAL USES.



Nothing in these provisions shall relieve any property owner or user from
satisfying any condition or requirement associated with a previous approval,
special permit, variance, development permit or other permit issued under any
local, State or Federal ordinance or statute.



1.   Horticulture and Crop Production: Retail Sales.  Retail operation of

llamas, ostriches, emus, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and guinea fowl. 
Domesticated ostriches, emus, chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea fowl, and
geese are the only birds included in this use.  No building in which animals
are quartered shall be located closer than 200 feet to any dwelling, church,
school or place of business located on abutting property.



4.   Commercial Feedlots.



   A.   Location.  Any new commercial feedlot shall be subject to
approval of a special use permit, as set forth by the Board of Adjustment.

feedlots.  In addition to other requirements, all applications for special
use permits for the establishment of a commercial feedlot use shall include
certifications of plan review and approval by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources or its successor agencies; a site plan showing the location and
maximum area of the confinement area; and a detailed description of
operations, including maximum number and type of livestock to be confined,

165.24  SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS – INDUSTRIAL USES.



1.   Adult Entertainment.  It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate
adult entertainment businesses to limit their inherent adverse impact in the
community while at the same time permitting lawful businesses to conduct
operations in the community.  The City Council finds, as evidenced in other
cities, that the number of adult entertainment businesses is increasing and
that, because of their very nature, such businesses are recognized as having
serious, objectionable operational characteristics, which are magnified when
located in close proximity to dwellings, churches, schools and parks. 
Special regulation of adult entertainment businesses is necessary to ensure
that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.  The City Council further finds
that these regulations are necessary to protect the youth of this community
from the objectionable operational characteristics of such businesses by
restricting their location.  The City Council further finds that these
regulations are necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare
of all residents of the community.

Building integrated and passive systems which spatially go beyond
conventional design or which are made of reflective material shall be subject
to all the regulations herein for attached solar energy systems.



   D.   Freestanding Solar Energy Systems:



      (1)   Setbacks.  Solar Energy Systems shall not be located
within any required front setback or street side yard setback.  Minimum
setback from interior side and rear lot lines and other structures shall be
ten (10) feet. 



      (2)   Easements, Utilities, Rights of Ways.  No portion of
any Solar Energy System shall extend into any easement, right of way or
public way regardless of above stated minimum setbacks.



      (3)   Location.  Solar Energy Systems shall be located on the
same lot as the building being served except that freestanding systems are
permitted without a principal building on the same lot when used in
conjunction with permitted uses that may not have a principal use building,
including but not limited to automobile parking facilities, bicycle parking
facilities, and automobile solar charging facilities.



      (4)   Height.  Maximum height limit shall be six (6) feet for
residential and fifteen (15) feet for non residential uses as measured from
the grade of the system at base to the highest peak, including the highest
position of any adjustable system.  Base design criteria for Solar Energy
System (SES) – Minor qualification shall be limited to six (6) feet for
maximum height limit.



      (5)   Maximum Size.  Systems for residential properties shall
not exceed one-tenth (1/10) of the footprint of the principal building served
or one hundred (100) square feet, whichever is greater.  Systems for
non-residential properties shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of the footprint
of the principal structure building served.  Measurement of the system shall
be based upon the area of the solar receiving panel, regardless of the
adjustment angle of the panel.



      (6)   Coverage area.  Any system which does not take up more
than 100 square feet of footprint area measured at outermost vertical
dimensions is considered as a Solar Energy System (SES) - Minor.  Electric
permit requirements still apply.



   E.   Attached Solar Energy Systems:



      (1)   In the case of wall mounting, no part of the system
shall project more than five (5) feet from the building.



      (2)   No part of the system shall extend more than 50 percent
into any required side or rear setback.  No part of the system shall extend
into any required front or street side yard setback.



      (3)   No portion of any Solar Energy System shall extend into
any easement, right of way or public way, regardless of above stated setbacks
and projection limitations.



      (4)   Systems shall not exceed the maximum height in the zone,
for the structure to which it attached.



      (5)   The building must have a conforming principal use.



      (6)   Roof attached systems may be mounted on principal and
accessory building roofs provided they conform to the maximum height
standards established for the zoning district.  Systems shall be no higher
than three (3) feet from the roof surface for residential use property
systems.  Non residential use property systems may project up to a maximum
of ten (10) feet from the roof.  In no case, however, shall a System exceed
the maximum height for principal structure where attached to said structure
or the maximum height for accessory structure where attached to said
structure.  Base criteria for Solar Energy System (SES) – Minor
qualification shall be limited to 6 inches maximum projection for residential
use and parallel mounting required.



      (7)   Systems in the Design Review Overlay District or Dutch
Residential Overlay District shall only be permitted where they are facing
the rear yard or are otherwise not visible from the front yard, street yard,
or a public street.



      (8)   Coverage area.  Any system which does not take up more
than 100 square feet of footprint area measured at outermost vertical
dimensions is considered as a Solar Energy System (SES) - Minor.  Electric
permit requirements still apply.



   F.   Solar Access.  A property owner who has installed or intends
to install a Solar Energy System shall be responsible for negotiation with
other property owners in the vicinity for any necessary solar easement.  The
granting of a Special Use Permit for Solar Energy System by the Board of
Adjustment does not constitute solar access rights.



   G.   Special Use Permit Application Materials.  The Special Use
Permit application for Solar Energy System shall include, but not be limited
to:



      (1)   A plot plan drawn to scale, showing:



         a)   Existing structures on the lot



         b)   Proposed system



         c)   Property lines



         d)   Setbacks of existing and proposed structures



         e)   Rights of ways

   H.   Special Use Permit Criteria.  Any proposed Solar Energy System
is  permitted only through Special Use Permit through Board of Adjustment
except Solar Energy System – Minor which meets all base design criteria. 
To approve a Special Use Permit for Solar Energy System, the Board of
Adjustment must find that the proposal conforms to the following criteria:



      (1)   The system will to the extent reasonably practical
through placement and design minimize the impact to the character of the
neighboring properties as they exist on the date of approval, which is
defined as properties within 200 feet of the system property.



      (2)   Access to open space (air and light) from the
neighboring properties is not significantly reduced.



      (3)   The predominate pattern of building placement, height,
orientation and scale among the neighboring properties and general area
beyond the neighboring properties will not be negatively impacted or altered
by the system.



      (4)   The system meets other City, State, and Federal
regulations.



      (5)   Unique topography, vegetation or lot conditions exist
which help to shield the system from the view of neighboring properties and
from the street or placement of the principal building allows the system to
be located and operated in a way that helps to shield the system from the
view of neighboring properties.



   I.   Special Use Permit Approval.  The Board of Adjustment may
request additional information if insufficient information is presented to
determine conformance with the criteria.  If approved the Special Use Permit
can be revoked after a public hearing, if there is evidence that the system
does not comply with the provisions of the Special Use Permit.  The Board
may impose conditions as it deems necessary for the general welfare of the
public and for information required for a Special Use Permit.



   J.   Interconnection Agreement.  A Solar Energy System shall not be
installed until evidence has been given that the utility company has been
informed of the customer’s intent to install an interconnected
customer-owned system and a copy of executed interconnection agreement with
the utility company is provided.



   K.   Abandonment.  Any solar energy system that is not operated for
a continuous period of 180 days shall be considered abandoned and shall be
removed by the property owner.  Removal includes the entire structure
including transmission equipment.



   L.   Signage.  Any signs shall be limited to one (1) square foot.



   M.   Maintenance.  The property owner of any Solar Energy System
shall maintain such system in a safe and attractive manner, including
replacement of defective parts, painting, cleaning, and other acts that may
be required for the maintenance and upkeep of the function and appearance of
such a system. 



   N.   Underground Wire Requirement.    The electrical collection
system shall be placed underground within the interior of each parcel. 
Overhead lines shall not be permitted.



   O.   Industry Standard.  As part of the Special Use Permit,
documentation shall be provided showing that the system and parts meet
industry standards, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), or another
standard applicable to the technology and materials of the system.



   P.   Applicable Fees.  The applicant for any Solar Energy System
under this Ordinance shall be responsible for any applicable fees, including
Board of Adjustment fee, City Engineer review fee (at cost), Building Permit,
and/or Electric Permit fees as established in Chapter 171.

165.30  SUPPLEMENTAL SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.



The supplemental site development regulations establish basic requirements
for developable lots, including frontage requirements that recognize the
existence of special conditions that cannot comply literally with the site
development regulations set out for each zoning district.  Therefore, these
regulations qualify or modify the district regulations of this chapter and
provide for specific areas of exception.



1.   Required Street Frontage.  Except as permitted below, any lot used
in whole or part for residential purposes shall provide a minimum frontage of
twenty feet (20') along at least one public street, or shall possess an
exclusive, uninterrupted private easement of access or right-of-way of at
least twenty feet (20') wide to a public street.  There shall not be more
than one single-family housing unit for such frontage or easement.  A common
easement of access at least sixty feet (60') in width may be provided for two
or more single-family units or for one or more duplex, two-family, townhouse
or multiple-family housing units.



2.   Lot Size Exceptions and Setbacks.  The following are exceptions and
modifications to regulations concerning lot and yard requirements:



   A.   Use of Existing Lots of Record.  In any district where
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling may
be located on any lot or plot of official record as of September 29, 1976,
irrespective of its area, or width; provided that the provisions of
subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall apply to single-family
dwellings and two-family dwellings only.



      (1)   The sum of the side yard widths of any such lot or plot
shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of the width of the lot, but in
no case less than ten percent (10%) of the width of the lot for any one side
yard.



      (2)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not
exceed twenty percent (20%) of the depth of the lot, but in no case less than
twenty feet (20').



      (3)   In the event that application of any of the requirements
of subparagraphs (1) or (2) to a particular lot would impose a greater
setback than required under the regulations of the district in which the lot
is located, then the lesser setback requirements of the district shall
control.  In the event that two or more such lots with continuous frontage
are combined under single ownership, then such combined lots shall be treated
as a single lot for purposes of applying the requirements of foregoing
subparagraphs.



   B.   Front Yard.  In all residential districts there shall be a
minimum front yard required as stated in the bulk regulations for that
particular district; provided, however, that where lots comprising thirty
percent (30%) or more of the frontage within two hundred feet (200') of
either side lot line are developed with buildings at a greater or lesser
setback, the front yard requirement shall be the average of these building
setbacks and the minimum front yard required for the undeveloped lots.  In
computing the average setback, buildings located on reverse corner lots or
entirely on the rear half of lots shall not be counted.  The required front
yard as computed herein need not exceed sixty feet (60') in any case.



   C.   Double Frontage on Huber and Oskaloosa Streets.  In commercial
districts where lots have frontage on both Huber Street and Oskaloosa Street,
there shall be a minimum front yard required as stated in the bulk
regulations for that particular district except for the following:  Where
lots comprising thirty percent (30%) or more of the Oskaloosa Street frontage
within two hundred feet (200') of either side lot line are developed with
buildings at a lesser setback on Oskaloosa Street than normally required, the
front yard requirements shall be the average of these building setbacks or 15
feet, whichever is less.  This exception shall only apply to the Oskaloosa
Street minimum front yard frontage requirement. 



   D.   Corner Yard or Lots.  For corner lots, platted or of record
after the effective date hereof, the front yard regulation shall apply to
each street side of the corner lot.  On corner lots platted or of record as
of September 29, 1976, the side yard regulations shall apply to the longer
street side of the lot except in the case of reverse frontage where the
corner lot faces an intersecting street.  In this case, there shall be a
side yard on the longer street side of the corner lot of not less than fifty
percent (50%) of the front yard required on the lots to the rear of such
corner lot, and no accessory building on said corner lot shall project beyond
the setback line of the lots in the rear; provided further that this
regulation shall not be interpreted to reduce the buildable width of the
corner lot facing an intersecting street and of record or as shown by
existing contract of purchase as of the effective date of this Zoning

9.   Large Retail Establishments – Special Site Development Standards. 
These standards are intended to ensure that large retail building development
is compatible with its surrounding area, promotes a pedestrian friendly
environment and contributes to the unique character of Pella, Iowa.  All
commercial developments, regardless of size, shall be required to obtain a
design permit pursuant to the Design Review District which includes design
review by the Community Development Committee.  The Design Review District
Design Manual shall be used as a set of parameters with respect to design
permit compliance.  In addition, a new retail development, standalone or
combination of smaller stores that exceeds 50,000 square feet shall adhere to
the following site development standards:



   A.   Parking Lot Location.  No more than fifty percent (50%) of the
off-street parking area for the lot, tract or area of land devoted to the
large retail establishment shall be located between the front facade of the
large retail establishment and the abutting streets.  The front parking area
shall be determined by drawing a line from the front corners of the building
to the nearest property corners.  If any such line, when connected to the
plane of the front facade of the building, creates an angle that is greater
than one hundred eighty (180) degrees, then the line shall be adjusted to
create an angle of one hundred eighty (180) degrees when connected to the
plane of the front facade of the building.  If any such line, when connected
to the plane of the front facade of the building, creates an angle that is
less than ninety (90) degrees, then the line shall be adjusted to create an
angle of ninety (90) degrees when connected to the plane of the front facade
of the building.  Parking spaces shall be counted to include all parking
spaces within the boundaries of the front parking area, including (i) all
partial parking spaces if the part inside the front parking area boundary
lines constitutes more than one-half (1/2) of said parking space, and (ii)
all parking spaces associated with any pad sites located within the front
parking area boundaries.  Further, in cases where the lot or land is located
in or is adjacent a Gateway Corridor Overlay District, no off-street parking
areas shall be allowed in the required front yard setbacks or in the front of
buildings.  Parking may be located on the side or rear of buildings. 



   B.   Connectivity.  The site design must provide direct connections
and safe street crossings to adjacent land uses.



   C.   Pedestrian Circulation.  Sidewalks at least eight (8) feet in
width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public
street.  Continuous internal pedestrian walkways shall be provided from the
public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all
large retail establishments on the site.  All internal pedestrian walkways
shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low
maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks or scored concrete to
enhance pedestrian safety and comfort as well as the overall aesthetics of
the walkways.



   D.   Landscaping.  Landscaping shall be in accordance with the
provisions of Section 165.31, Landscaping and Screening Requirements.  In
addition, the following special requirements for large retail establishments
shall apply:



      (1)   At least fifty percent (50%) of internal pedestrian
walkways shall have adjacent landscaping, including trees, shrubs, benches,
flower beds, ground covers or other similar materials.  The required
landscaping contained in the provisions of Section 165.31 may be used in
conjunction with this requirement.



      (2)   Any loading or docking areas shall be screened with a
Type A screen per Section 165.31 of this chapter.  The required landscaping
contained in the provisions of Section 165.31 may be used in conjunction with
this requirement.



10.   Retaining Walls.  The purpose of this subsection is to provide
minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare by
regulating the construction and placement of retaining wall systems through
the adoption of specific standards to augment existing codes.  These
provisions shall apply to the construction and or alteration of retaining
walls on all public and private property that is not within a public
right-of-way of the City.



   A.   Definitions.  For the purposes of this subsection the
following definitions shall apply:



      (1)   "Building code" means the 2003 International Building
Code as amended and adopted by the Code of Ordinances by the City of Pella.



      (2)   "Height of wall" means the measured distance between the
bottom of the footing to the top of a wall.



      (3)   "Retaining wall" means a manmade structure built out of
rock, block, wood, or other similar material and used to either directly
support retained material or to serve as a facing of a cut slope.  This
definition includes, but is not limited to, other systems designed to retain
earth or other materials such as a geosynthetic-reinforced soil system.



   B.   Design and Construction.  A retaining wall may be located on a
lot line, but no such wall shall protrude in full or part on adjacent
property, easements, or right-of-way.  No retaining wall shall be placed in
a manner that impedes vision between a height of two and one-half feet (2½ )
and twelve feet (12 ) above the surface of the street in the area forming a
triangle bounded by the street right-of-way lines or property lines of a
corner lot and a straight line joining points on the right-of-way lines
twenty-five feet (25 ) from the point of intersection of the right-of-way or
property lines.  Retaining wall systems shall be designed by a professional
engineer licensed to practice in the state of Iowa for all walls over six (6)
feet in height.  Where multiple walls are situated in a terrace-like pattern
they shall be considered one wall for purposes of determining the height of
wall if the horizontal separation between adjacent walls is less than or
equal to the combined height of the walls.



   C.   Maintenance.  Retaining walls shall be maintained by the
property owner and according to all other codes of the City of Pella.  When
a wall is within the walls height of a public right-of-way or in a public
right-of-way, and in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent
danger of failure or collapse, the code official shall temporarily close the
public way, based on Section 109 of the Property Maintenance Code, and notify
the land owner that repairs shall be made in a prescribed timely manner.  If
the owner of a premises fails to comply within the time prescribed, the code
official shall proceed with a property maintenance code infraction.



   D.   Guardrails.  Retaining walls over six feet high for all land
uses except agricultural shall have a guardrail, hedge, or other barrier of
at least 36  high installed along the top edge of the wall if there is a
walking surface within two (2) feet from the top of the retaining wall.



   E.   Permit Requirement.  It is unlawful to construct, enlarge,
alter, repair or demolish any retaining wall without a building permit from
the City.  Requirements shall be based on the parcel's land use and the
height of the proposed wall as shown in Table 165.30 below.  Height shall be
measured from the base of the wall to the top of the wall at the wall's
tallest point.

prohibit full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and would deny
the property owner of use of their property would be permitted to other
properties, a variance may be considered.

(Ord. 888 – July 14 Supp.)



165.31  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.



The landscaping and screening standards provide additional guidance on the
development of sites within Pella by addressing landscaping and screening
requirements.  They are designed to improve and protect the appearance of
the community; buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another;
and preserve the value of properties within the City of Pella and surrounding
areas where extraterritorial zoning is adopted.



1.   Applicability.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all
new development on each lot or site upon application for a building permit,
except for the following:



   A.   Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or
structure following a loss by fire, storm, tornado or other act of God
greater than 60% of total building gross floor area.



   B.   Remodeling, rehabilitation or improvements to existing uses
which do not require a building permit, or structures which do not
substantially change the location of structures, parking or other site
improvements.



   C.   Additions or enlargements to existing uses or structures that
increase floor area or impervious coverage area by less than twenty-five
percent (25%) and that are less than 5,000 square feet.  Where such
additions or enlargements are 25% or greater or larger than 5,000 square
feet, these provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new
development occurs.



A development may continue to comply with the buffer yard and screening
requirements in effect at the time of issuance of its original permit,
regardless of whether an adjacent lot or site is subsequently rezoned to a
less intensive district which would otherwise require compliance with buffer
yard or screening provisions.



2.   Definitions.  For the interpretation of this section, the following
definitions shall be used:



   A.   “Greenspace area” means an area devoted to or developed
predominately with plant material or natural landscape features, including
lawn, ground cover, gardens, trees, shrubs and other plant materials.  At a
minimum “greenspace” includes grass or ground cover plus additional
trees, shrubs or other screening where required herein.



   B.   “Screened” means shielded, concealed and effectively hidden
from view by a person standing at ground level on an abutting site along the
property line, or outside the area or feature so screened, by a fence, wall,
hedge, berm or similar architectural or landscaped feature.  In the event of
sloping topography, the adjacent property line shall be the geographic
reference point wherever screening is required.



3.   Landscaping Requirements.  Single-family and two-family dwellings
shall maintain a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of lot area as a
permeable and uncovered surface that contains living materials. 
Single-family and two-family dwellings are exempt from other requirements of
this section.  All other uses shall provide and maintain a greenspace area
that equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total lot area unless
specified otherwise herein.  The CBD District, because of its distinct and
unique character, is exempt from the provisions of this section except for
the screening requirements contained in Table 165.31-2.  Additions or
enlargements of existing uses or structures in the CBD District that increase
floor area or impervious coverage area, including parking areas, by more than
twenty-five percent (25%) shall adhere to the buffer yard requirements in
Table 165.31-2. 



4.   Landscaping Materials and Installation Standards.



   A.   Installation.  All landscaping shall be installed in
accordance with accepted good planting procedures and other applicable City
Codes and policies.  The plant materials shall form an effective screen
based on the approved site plan within five (5) growing seasons of
installation.  Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular
encroachment.  Installation of required landscaping shall be done within two
(2) years after the date of Planning and Zoning Commission approval of the
site plan. 



   B.   Use of Inorganic Landscaping Materials.  No artificial trees,
shrubs, plants or turf shall be used to fulfill the minimum requirements for
landscaping.  Inorganic materials, such as stone or decorative pavers, may
be used provided that such material does not comprise more than 35% of the
minimum required landscaped area.  Other concrete and/or asphalt pavement
surfaces may not be used within the minimum required landscaped area, except
for walkways less than five (5) feet in width.



   C.   Plant Material.



      (1)   Trees.  Trees shall be a minimum of one inch (1")
caliper [as measured one (1) foot above ground level] at the time of planting.



      (2)   Shrubs and Hedges.  Shrubs shall be minimum of twelve
(12) inches in height when measured at ground level immediately after
planting.  Hedges, where required, shall be planted and maintained so as to
form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen within a maximum of five (5)
years after time of planting.



      (3)   Vines.  Vines shall be a minimum of one gallon
container after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens,
or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as specified.



      (4)   Ground Covers.  Ground covers used in lieu of grass, in
whole or in part, shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished
appearance and reasonably complete coverage within twelve (12) months after
planting.



   D.   Location of Required Landscaping.  The following areas are
listed by priority for the placement of the required landscaped area:



      (1)   A minimum greenspace area of five feet (5') in width
along all street frontages unless a greater width is required per Tables
165.31-1 and 165.31-2 or per the maturation factor specified below. 
Street/right-of-way landscaping shall not be located within the public
right-of-way itself with the exception of City or State right-of-way
landscaping.



      (2)   A minimum greenspace area of five feet (5') in width
along all perimeter property lines unless a greater width is required per
Tables 165.31-1 and 165.31-2.  This five-foot perimeter greenspace area
requirement does not apply to side yards where zero foot interior side yard
setbacks are allowed or for uses in the CBD or CUC Districts.



      (3)   Trees required as part of Type C right-of-way plantings
shall be placed at least one-half the maturation diameter from the
right-of-way line.



   E.   Landscaping for Off-Street Parking Areas.  All off-street
parking areas (except for single and two-family uses) shall provide site
trees on the basis of one (1) tree for every ten (10) off-street parking
spaces provided or fraction thereof.  Fifty percent (50%) of required site
trees shall be placed along street frontages.  The remaining 50% may be
placed in interior parking lot areas.  Site trees shall be of a minimum one
inch (1") caliper as measured one (1) foot above ground level at the time of
planting.  Further, required site trees may be utilized in conjunction with
parking area screening requirements as set forth in this section.



      (1)   Parking areas in the M2 Heavy Industrial Zoning District
shall be exempt from the landscaping requirements except where said parking
areas are adjacent non-industrial zoning districts or uses or where they are
located adjacent a Gateway Corridor Overlay District.  (Ord. 681 - Oct. 05
Supp.)



   F.   Tulip Plantings in Lieu of Right-of-Way Trees.  Up to 50% of
required street/right-of-way trees may be substituted with twenty (20) square
feet of tulip plantings per substituted tree.  A minimum density of three
(3) bulbs per square foot shall be maintained for such tulip plantings.  The
location of the tulip bulb planting areas shall be the same as the area of
the tree being substituted.  If tulip planting areas are used, they must be
shown on the site plan and must be maintained as with any other site
landscaping.  The tulip planting areas used as substitute for required
street/right-of-way trees shall also be maintained with annual flowers
(annuals) at least between June 1 and September 1.  The annual flowers shall
have a density of at least two bedding plants per square foot.

5.   Screening Requirements.  Table 165.31-2, Table of Screening
Requirements, found later in this section, refers to the following types of
screens listed below.  The following three basic types of screens are hereby
established and are to be used as the basis for screening requirements as
established in such Table, as provided herein.  Variations of these
screening types which do not alter the intent of this section may be
permitted at the time of site plan review with approval from the Zoning
Administrator.



   A.   Opaque Screen, Type A.  A screen that is opaque from the
ground to a height of at least six feet (6') with intermittent visual
obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet
(12'), except that uses in the CUC and CBD Districts or other uses that have
a zero lot line setback and utilize a wall or fence to meet Type A screening
requirements shall only be required to achieve the 6' tall, opaque screening
standard.  The opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact
between uses and to create a strong impression of physical separation.  The
opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm,
planted or existing vegetation.  Planted vegetation or natural vegetation
will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of
foliage of the subject species or by field observation of existing
vegetation.  The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons
of the year.  At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions
should not contain any completed unobstructed openings more than ten feet
(10') wide.  The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain
deciduous plants.  Planting areas for the placement of these screens (for
vegetative screen) shall be in accordance with Table 165.31-1, but in no case
less than five feet (5') in width.  The following are typical Type A Opaque
Screens:




v   Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).





v   Six-foot high evergreen shrubbery planted four (4) feet on center (see
Planting List D).





v   Medium or large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting
List B or C).





v   Six-foot high earth-tone or natural colored wooden fence with
intermittent trees (where maximum fence height restrictions allow).





v   Six-foot high earth-tone or natural colored wooden fence or earth-tone
or natural colored masonry wall (where maximum fence height restrictions
allow).





v   Medium or large evergreen trees, planted staggered, with the branches
touching the ground (see Planting List E or F).




   B.   Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B.  A screen that is opaque from the
ground to a height of three feet (3'), with intermittent visual obstruction
from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet (12')
except that uses in the CUC and CBD Districts or other uses that have a zero
lot line setback and utilize a wall or fence to meet Type B screening
requirements are only required to achieve a 3' tall, opaque screen with
intermittent visual obstruction to a minimum height of six (6) feet.  The
semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm,
planted or existing vegetation.  Compliance of planted vegetative screens or
natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height
and density of foliage of the subject species or by field observation of
existing vegetation.  At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual
obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more
than ten feet (10') wide.  The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may
contain deciduous plants.  Planting areas for the placement of these screens
(for vegetative screens) shall be in accordance with Table 165.31-1, but in
no case less than five feet (5') in width.  The following are typical Type B
Semi-Opaque Screens.




v   Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).





v   Three-foot high earth-tone or natural colored stone or masonry wall
with intermittent trees.





v   Small trees planted twenty (20) to thirty (30) feet on center on top
of berm (see Planting List A).





v   Three-foot high seeded or sodded earth berm (see Berming Requirements)
with intermittent trees.





v   Large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting List C).





v   Three-foot high evergreen hedge shrubbery planted three (3) on center
(see Planting List D).




   C.   Broken Screen, Type C.  A screen composed of intermittent
visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least twelve feet
(12').  The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a
separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between
the spaces.  It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm,
planted or existing vegetation.  Compliance of planted vegetative screens or
natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height
and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of
existing vegetation.  The screen may contain deciduous plants.  Planting
areas for the placement of these screens (for vegetative screens) shall be in
accordance with Table 165.31-1, but in no case less than five feet (5') in
width.  The following are typical Type C Broken Screens:




v   Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).





v   Split rail or picket wooden fence with intermittent trees (fence
colors for screening purposes shall be earth tone, white or natural wood
colors).





v   Medium or large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting
List B or C).





v   Small trees planted forty (40) feet on center with assorted shrubbery
(see Planting Lists A, D, and G).





v   Assorted shrubbery combined with tulip plantings (see Planting Lists D
and G).




6.   Screening Locations.  Screening, as required in the Table of
Screening Requirements, shall be required along the common lot lines of
adjacent uses.  Where uses are separated by an intervening right-of-way, the
burdened use need only screen from the adjoining right-of-way as required in
the Table.  Screening required by a burdened use for a benefited use shall
apply only to those uses which are determined to be permitted within the
particular zoning district.  A burdened use is not required to provide
screening to benefit a use within a zoning district that is determined to be
a nonconforming use.



7.   Fencing.  Fencing used as screening shall comply with the
regulations of Section 165.30 of this chapter.  In the event of conflict
with the Landscaping and Screening provisions, the provisions of Section
165.30 shall apply.

Please refer to Section 165.12 and the Zoning Map for information pertaining
to specific zoning districts.


**   Single and two-family residential are not required to screen between
uses, but all other uses in RR, R1, R1A, R1B, R1C, and R3 Districts are
required to provide screening between uses as shown above.



#   A minimum of five (5) feet of greenspace area is required unless a
greater width is required by other provisions of this section.  Uses in the
CBD and CUC Districts and other uses with a zero lot line setback may utilize
a fence, masonry wall or other screen that meets Type A screen standards in
lieu of the 5-foot greenspace.



***  M2 screening requirement for adjoining ROW (right of way) shall only
apply to Gateway Corridor Overlay District right of ways.  (Ord. 681 - Oct.
05 Supp.)








 



Table 165.31-2:  Additional Requirements and Clarifications.






v   For industrial districts, see Section 165.31(7) for special buffer
yard and berming requirements.





v   Burdened Use:  The use which must provide the required screening.





v   Benefited Use:  The use from which the burdened use is screened.





v   CBD uses which abut residential districts or residential uses
established prior to the adoption date of the Zoning Ordinance in other
commercial districts or in the CBD District shall be required to have a Type
A Screen where adjacent to said use or district.





v   CUC uses which abut residential districts or residential uses
established prior to the adoption date of the Zoning Ordinance in other
commercial districts or in the CUC District shall be required to have a Type
A Screen where adjacent to said use or district.





v   CC uses which abut residential districts or residential uses
established prior to the adoption date of the Zoning Ordinance in other
commercial districts or in the CC District shall be required to have a Type A

8.   Special Screening Requirements – Definitions.  The following five
basic types are hereby established and are to be used as the basis for
screening requirements (unless modified elsewhere in this chapter) as
established for the uses herein described.



   A.   Berms.  A berm screen constructed of earthen materials not to
exceed a slope of steeper than 3:1.  A berm shall be so designed that
drainage from said slope shall be directed away from paved areas and

at his or her own expense, remove all dead wood or limbs from elm trees and
any other tree otherwise diseased or having dead limbs.  Removal of any
diseased or dead tree or limb shall be completed within ten (10) days after
receipt of written notice to remove the diseased or dead item.  If the
owner, occupant or agent in charge of any property fails to comply with
written notice ordering the removal of any dead or diseased tree, bush, wood
or debris, the City Council shall have the item removed and the cost to do so
shall be assessed against the property.  If an assessment for removal of
dead or diseased items is not promptly paid (within sixty [60] days), the
City Clerk shall certify the costs of removal to the County Treasurer, and
such costs shall be collected with and in the same manner as general property
taxes.



14.   Sight Corner Visibility.  On a corner lot, nothing shall be

vision between a height of two and one-half feet (2½') and twelve feet (12')
above the surface of the street described as follows:  an area forming a
triangle bounded by the street right-of-way lines or property lines of a
corner lot and a straight line joining points on the right-of-way lines
twenty-five feet (25’) from the point of intersection of the right-of-way

15.   Gateway Corridor Overlay District Standards.  The requirements for
the Gateway Corridor Overlay District are based on the Washington
Street/Vermeer Road Visual Quality Study and are intended to protect and
enhance property values and provide a high level of visual aesthetics as one
enters Pella.  In particular, they are intended to help these corridors
maintain a quaint and beautified appearance as new development and
redevelopment occurs.  The following standards shall apply to the Gateway
Corridor Overlay District and be utilized in conjunction with the other
requirements contained in this chapter except that these right-of-way or
streetscape requirements shall be used in lieu of the standard “Type C”
right-of-way screening.  All other screening requirements in this chapter
shall apply (parking landscaping, buffer landscaping, etc.).

165.32  OFF-STREET PARKING.



The off-street parking regulations require that developments provide parking
in proportion to the need created by each use.  The regulations further
establish standards for the functional design of parking facilities.  These
regulations are intended to accommodate vehicles in a functionally
satisfactory manner and to minimize external effects on neighboring
properties.



1.   Applicability.  Off-Street parking shall be provided for any new
building constructed, for new uses or conversions of existing buildings, or
for enlargements of existing structures.




(Ord. 804 - Mar. 10 Supp.)




2.   Exemptions.



   A.   Off-Street Parking Exemption for CBD.  Any use within the CBD
Central Business District, other than residential, is exempt from the
requirement to provide off-street parking.  However, any commercial or
residential off-street parking facility constructed in the CBD District after
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance must comply with the design
standards set forth in this section.



   B.   Existing Nonconforming Uses Exempted from Paving.  All
off-street parking areas which were in existence on June 19, 2001 and did not
comply with the paving requirements herein are rendered as legal
nonconforming and are hereby exempt from the paving provisions of this
section.  If, however, a building addition or other development occurs,
including a parking lot expansion, that triggers site plan review, then
conformance with the paving standards shall be required for the area of the
addition.  The Central Business District is exempt from the paving
requirements of this section for any off-street parking areas which were in
existence on June 19, 2001 until such time that the City would undertake an
alley reconstruction project within the block where the parking is located. 
The City Council upon such alley reconstruction commencement shall through
resolution determine a reasonable time frame for said hard surfacing of non
compliant parking areas.




(Ord. 804 - Mar. 10 Supp.)




   C.   Gravel Roads.  New or existing off-street parking areas, which
are located on a publicly owned right-of-way that is still gravel or dirt and
which have no other access via a paved public road are exempted from the
paving requirements herein until two (2) years after the date that the gravel
or dirt road is paved.  In no case, however, shall this provision reduce the
ten-year time period granted under subsection 1 of this section for existing
nonconforming commercial off-street parking areas.



   D.   (Deleted by Ord. 804 - Mar. 10 Supp.)



   E.   Nonconforming Uses in the CUC District.  Any uses in the CUC
District at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified by this paragraph
(October 7, 2003) which do not comply with the minimum off-street parking
requirements shall be considered as legal nonconforming uses with respect to
the noncompliant parking.  This provision shall include any subsequent
permitted uses that occupy the premises provided that the subsequent use
would not otherwise be required to have a greater number of off-street
parking spaces than the preexisting nonconforming use.  In the event that a
building becomes vacant or unused for a continuous period of six months, the
legal nonconforming status of the off-street parking shall still be
maintained.


(Ord. 634 - May 04 Supp.)





3.   Site Plan Required.  A site plan shall be required for the
construction or expansion of any existing parking lot, drive or other hard
surfaced area but only if the total square footage of new hard surfacing
exceeds 2000 square feet.                  (Ord. 821 - Oct.
10 Supp.)



4.   Promotions and Tent Events.  No special promotion, fixtures, tents
or sales event shall occupy parking spaces on a preexisting parking lot,
which would result in the required parking spaces to fall below the minimum
required spaces.  This requirement shall only apply to long term promotions
and tent events that exceed seven (7) days of continuous duration and are not
associated directly with Tulip Time, carnivals, college or university events.



5.   Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements.  Parking facilities for
each use shall be provided in accord with the minimum requirements set forth
in Table 165-32-1.



   A.   When a computation of required parking results in a fraction or
part of a space, the requirement shall be rounded up to the next whole number.



   B.   Unless otherwise indicated, parking requirements are based on
gross floor area.  Gross floor areas for the purpose of this calculation
exclude any interior space used for the parking or loading of vehicles.



   C.   When parking requirements are computed on the basis of
capacity, capacity shall be determined by the most recent edition of the
Uniform Building Code (UBC) or other official determinations of occupancy in
effect for the City of Pella at the time the use is established.

uses must permit vehicles to enter streets in a forward position.  All
driveways shall meet the minimum current City standards.

but shall in no case encroach upon the public right-of-way.



      (3)   Parking of personal vehicles may occur in the rear yard
setback (outside of an enclosed structure and not on the front yard paved
driveway) if the Zoning Administrator determines that such parking conforms
to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, under the following condition: 
The parking space is provided on a paved surface connected by a paved surface
to a dedicated public right-of-way and/or alley.  Residential lots in the A1
or RR Districts are exempt from the paving requirements of this section.



      (4)   Parking of trucks, other than panel or pickup trucks of
less than one ton capacity is prohibited in residential areas except to load
or unload.  Heavy commercial vehicles, including tractor cab units rated at

      (6)   Storage Location for Recreational Vehicles and Boats. 
No recreational vehicle or boat shall be stored in the front yard of a
residential lot except for the following:

one (1) vehicle may be stored in the front yard.



         b.   Where the residential lot is located in a RR or A1
District.



In no case, however, shall the storage in the front yard encroach on any

165.34  NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT.



1.   Purpose.  The purposes of this section are:



   A.   To allow for reasonable use of legally created lots of record
which do not meet current minimum requirements for their respective zoning
districts.



   B.   To provide for reasonable use of legally constructed structures
which do not meet current site development regulations for their respective
zoning districts.



   C.   To allow for the reasonable continuation of legally established
uses which do not meet current use regulations for their respective zoning
districts.



   D.   To limit the continuation and provide for the gradual
replacement of nonconforming uses.



2.   Regulations Additive.  Regulations for nonconforming uses are in
addition to regulations for nonconforming structures.  In the event of a
conflict, the most restrictive regulation shall apply.



3.   Nonconforming Lots.



   A.   Pre-existing Lots of Record.  Nonconforming lots of record
existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall be exempt, unless
otherwise provided, from the minimum lot area and lot width requirements of
each zoning district.  Such lots may be developed with any use allowed by
the regulations for the district and must comply with all other site
development regulations set forth by the Zoning Ordinance, except as provided
by Section 165.30.



   B.   Reductions Due to Public Acquisition.  If a portion of a
legally existing lot in any district is acquired for public use, the
remainder of this lot shall be considered a conforming lot.



   C.   Use of Existing Lots of Record for Marion County
Extra-territorial 28E Jurisdiction.  Any recorded lots in existence as of
the date of adoption of Ordinance No. 659 (October 5, 2004) in the Marion
County Extraterritorial 28E Zoning Jurisdiction shall be considered as
exempt, unless otherwise provided, from the minimum lot frontage
requirement.  This exemption shall include lots which do not have direct
frontage on a public street.  Such lots may be developed with any use
allowed by the regulations for the district and must comply with all other
site development regulations set forth by the Zoning Ordinance.
                                       �
�     (Ord. 659 - Oct. 04 Supp.)



4.   Nonconforming Structures.  These regulations apply to buildings and
structures which were constructed legally under regulations in effect before
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.



   A.   Continuation.  A lawful nonconforming structure existing on
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued, repaired,
maintained or altered, subject to the provisions of this section.



   B.   Additions or Enlargements to Nonconforming Structures. A lawful
nonconforming structure cannot be added to or enlarged in such a way which
increases its nonconformity.  An addition may be permitted if it satisfies
one or more of the following conditions:



      (1)   The enlargement or addition, when considered
independently of the existing building, complies with all applicable setback,
height, off-street parking, and landscaping requirements.



      (2)   The nonconforming building and impervious surface
coverage on the site are not increased and the building, after the addition,
conforms to height and off-street parking regulations applicable to its
zoning district.



      (3)   The addition projects no further into a required side
yard setback than the existing building; the length of the side wall of the
addition is the smaller of twenty-five (25) feet or fifty percent (50%) of
the length of the existing nonconforming side wall; and the enlarged building
complies with building and impervious coverage, front and rear yard setbacks
and height regulations applicable to its zoning district.



No permitted addition to a nonconforming structure may place a wall within
ten (10) feet of a window of an adjacent pre-existing residential
structure.  Nonconforming buildings shall be limited to one addition or
enlargement pursuant to these regulations.



   C.   Moving of Nonconforming Structures.  A lawful nonconforming
building or structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to another
location on its lot unless every part of the structure conforms to all site
development regulations applicable to its zoning district.



   D.   Repair of Nonconforming Structures.  A lawful nonconforming
building damaged by fire, explosion, storm or other calamity, except flood
damages, may be repaired and reconstructed provided there is no increase in
the degree of nonconformity and provided that the extent of the damaged area
is less than sixty percent (60%) of gross floor area of the structure above
its foundation.  Repair and reconstruction within the designated flood plain
shall be in conformance with Flood Plain Development regulations.



   E.   Conversion of a Conforming Building.  A conforming building
shall not be changed in any way that will result in a nonconforming
development.



   F.   Applicability of Landscaping and Screening Regulations.  A
pre-existing structure, building, or development shall be exempt from Section
165.31, Landscaping and Screening Regulations.  However, any expansion of
such structure, building, or development or any adjacent new development onto
property that is or becomes vacant on or after the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be subject to said section.



5.   Nonconforming Uses.



   A.   Continuation of Nonconforming Uses.  Any nonconforming use
lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance may
continue, subject to the limitations of this section.



   B.   Enlargement of Nonconforming Uses.  A building or structure
housing a lawful nonconforming use may not be added to or enlarged.



   C.   Abandonment of Nonconforming Use.  If any structure or
property used as a lawful nonconforming use becomes vacant or unused for a
continuous period of six (6) months, any subsequent use must conform to all
use regulations applicable to the property’s zoning district.



   D.   Relocation of Use.  No nonconforming use shall be moved in
whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not
occupied by such use at the effective adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance.



   E.   Change of Use.  A lawful nonconforming use may be changed only
to a use type permitted in the zoning district in which it is located.



   F.   Allowance for Repairs.  Repairs and maintenance of a structure
occupied by a nonconforming use may be made, provided that no structural
alterations are made other than those required by law.



   G.   Damage or Destruction of Structures.  Should a structure
occupied by a lawful nonconforming use be damaged by any means to an extent
that the area to be reconstructed exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the gross
floor area of the structure, exclusive of foundations, the nonconforming use
shall not be reconstructed and is no longer permitted.  If the structure is
less than 60% destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed and
used as before, provided reconstruction is completed within six (6) months of
the damage.



   H.   Nonconforming Uses and Special Use Permits.  A lawful
pre-existing use which would require a  special use permit in its zoning
district shall be presumed to have the appropriate permit and shall be
considered a conforming use.  The use shall be subject to the regulations
governing lapses or revocation of permits, set forth in Section 165.37(H).



6.   Nonconforming Uses in Extraterritorial CC District.



   A.   Any legal nonconforming use which was in existence as of the
date of adoption of the ordinance codified by this subsection (August 17,
2004) in the Marion County 28E Extraterritorial CC Community Commercial
Zoning District shall be considered as a legal conforming use and may expand
as if it were a permitted use.



   B.   Lot Expansions and Location Limitation.  A use as identified
in paragraph A shall be permitted to expand to the extent allowed by building
and setback requirements in place at the time of permit application.  Any
such expansion shall be limited only to the existing lot of record wherein
said use was located as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified by
this subsection (August 17, 2004).



   C.   Change of Use.  Any change of use from a use identified in
paragraph A to another use shall only be permitted if the new use is an
otherwise permitted use in the CC Zoning District.



   D.   Abandonment of Use.  If a use as identified in paragraph A
discontinues for a continuous period of six (6) months, any subsequent use
must then conform to the CC District requirements as delineated in Section
165.12, Permitted Uses by Zoning District.




(Ord. 656 - Oct. 04 Supp.)




7.   Nonconforming Funeral Service Use.

existence as of the date of adoption of this ordinance shall be considered as
a legal conforming use and may expand as if it were a permitted use.



   B.   Lot Expansions and Location Limitation.  A use as identified
in paragraph A. shall be permitted to expand to the extent allowed by

of record wherein said use was located as of the date of adoption of this
ordinance.



   C.   Change of Use.  Any change of use from a use identified in

receives a building permit and diligently carries out development prior to
the expiration of this period.



      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may approve a modification to a
previously approved site plan if such modification does not alter the
building location or change more than 25% of the exterior features (in terms
of total area or total number) including, but not limited to, parking and
landscaping which were designated on the Planning and Zoning
Commission-approved site plan.  Typical examples of such “modifications”
include parking lot reconfigurations, moving a loading dock location,
switching tree locations or tree species and minor adjustments to the
building such as door and window relocations or facade alterations.  In no
case shall such modifications be allowed if they would cause the site plan to
become noncompliant with regard to minimum parking, landscaping or other
requirements of this chapter.  In no case shall modifications to a
previously approved site plan be permitted after 180 days after the date of
Planning and Zoning Commission approval.  Minor facade alterations for
buildings that have a valid design permit may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator subject to Community Development Committee approval. 



      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may revoke a site plan approval
if he/she determines that the development is not complying with the terms and
conditions of the approval.  Such revocation may be appealed to the City
Council.



      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve minor
modifications or additions to already approved site plans that change the
footprint of the original proposed building area by not more than 25% in
terms of alteration or additional square footage in relation to the original
footprint area.  In no case shall modifications to a previously approved
site plan be permitted after 180 days after the date of Planning and Zoning
Commission approval.  Such modifications for buildings that have a valid
design permit may be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission subject
to Community Development Committee approval.



   I.   Approval to Run With Land.  An approval pursuant to this
section shall run with the land until the expiration date of such approval.



4.   Right-of-Way Dedication.  The dedication of public right-of-way
identified in the City's Comprehensive Plan or Transportation Plans shall be
required as part of a site plan applicant where such right-of-way is shown by
the Plan on the property of the site plan.  Said dedication shall include
sufficient right-of-way based on the Comprehensive Plan classification for
street type or other transportation route and shall be sufficiently sized to
accommodate any other public infrastructure related thereto.  The dedication
shall be required via acquisition plat or other means acceptable to the City
Attorney and shall be a condition of site plan approval.  This requirement
shall be considered as satisfied if the site plan represents a parcel in its
entirety which has been preliminary and final platted as part of an approved
subdivision where such right-of-way has been already dedicated.     (Ord.
754 - Sept. 07 Supp.)

165.38  AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.



This section describes the methods by which changes may be made in the text
of the Zoning Ordinance (text amendment) and/ or the official boundaries of
zoning districts (rezoning).



1.   Initiation of Amendments.  Text amendments may be initiated by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council.  A property owner,
authorized agent, the Planning and Zoning Commission or the City Council may
initiate by its own action rezoning of property.



2.   Rezoning Application Requirements.  An application for rezoning
shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator.  The application shall include
the following information:



   A.   Name and address of the applicant.



   B.   Owner, address and legal description of the property.



   C.   A description of the reason for the rezoning application and
the nature and operating characteristics of the proposed use.



   D.   Any graphic information, including site plans, elevations,
other drawings, or other materials determined by the Zoning Administrator to
be necessary to describe the proposed use to the Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or the City Council.



   E.   A properly completed rezoning permit application. 



   F.   A properly completed rezoning petition duly signed by the
owners of 50% of the area of all real estate included within the boundaries
of said tract as described in said petition and duly signed by the owners of
50% of the area of all real estate lying outside of said tract but within 300
feet of the boundaries of the said tract.  Both of the foregoing percentage
signature requirements are for advisory purposes only, and failure to obtain
either or both of the required percentages shall not prevent continuance of
the permit application.  City initiated rezonings are exempt from this
requirement.



   G.   A map indicating the property to be rezoned and affected
properties.



3.   Amendment Process.



   A.   If the amendment was initiated by the City Council or by a
property owner (or authorized agent), the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall consider the request and return its recommendation in writing to the
Council within sixty (60) days.  Upon request of the Commission to the
Council, the Commission shall have an additional thirty (30) days to return
its recommendation.



   B.   The Planning and Zoning Commission, following a notice and
publication, shall hold a public hearing on each proposed text amendment or
rezoning and, following such public hearing, shall recommend action to the
City Council.



   C.   The City Council, after publication and public hearing, shall
act on the proposed amendment.  A simple majority vote of those members
either elected or appointed to the City Council is required for approval
except as follows:  In case the proposed amendment, supplement or change be
disapproved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or a protest be presented
duly signed by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area of the
lots included in such proposed change, or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the property which is located within two hundred feet (200')
of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change is proposed,
then the change shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at
least three-fourths (3/4) of all the members of the City Council.



   D.   Whenever any petition for amendment, supplement or change of
the zoning districts or regulations herein contained or subsequently
established shall have been denied by the City Council, then no new petition
covering the same property or the same property and additional property shall
be filed with or considered by the City Council until one year shall have
elapsed from the date of filing of the first petition.



4.   Required Notice and Publication.  Prior to consideration of
amending, supplementing, changing, modifying, or repealing this chapter by
the governing body, notice of public hearings shall be provided by:

not less than one and one-half (1½) inches in height.  Such posted notice
shall be so placed upon such premises that is easily visible from the street
and shall be so posted at least ten (10) days before the date of such
hearing.  It is unlawful for any person to remove, mutilate, destroy or
change such posted notice prior to such hearing.

the following methods:



      (1)   Publication:  At least ten (10) days but not more than
twenty (20) days before the date of the City Council hearing, the Zoning
Administrator shall have published in a newspaper having a general
circulation in the City of Pella a Notice of the time, place and subject
matter of such hearing.  Prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission public
hearing the same notice shall be published for the Planning and Zoning
Commission hearing.



      (2)   Notification by Mail:  At least fifteen (15) days prior
to the date of hearing, the party initiating the rezoning request shall
present the Zoning Administrator an address list of those persons who own
property within 300 feet of the subject site.  The Zoning Administrator
shall mail notice of the time, place and subject matter of the hearing to
such property owners at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the
hearing.  This notification by mail is for advisory purposes only , and
failure to notify 100% of adjacent property owners shall not prevent
continuance of the rezoning application.



165.39  FUTURE ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY.



All unimproved or agricultural territory that may hereafter be annexed to the
City shall be considered as lying in the A1 Agricultural District until such
classification shall be changed as provided by this chapter.  Any improved
property that is annexed into the City shall be zoned according to the zoning
district that most nearly describes either its present use or the use
proposed by the Comprehensive Development Plan.  The Planning and Zoning
Commission and the City Council shall establish this zoning at the time of
annexation.



165.40  BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.



1.   Administration and Enforcement.  The Zoning Administrator shall
administer and enforce this chapter.  The City Council may direct other
persons to assist him/her.  If the Zoning Administrator finds that any of
the provisions of this chapter are being violated, he/she shall notify in
writing the person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of
the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it.  He/she shall
order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures;
removal of illegal buildings or structures or of illegal additions,
alterations, or structural changes; discontinuance of any illegal work being
done; or shall take any other action authorized by this chapter or to ensure
compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.



2.   Building Permits Required.  No building or other structure shall be
erected, moved, added to, or structurally altered without a permit therefor,
issued by the Zoning Administrator.  No building permit shall be issued by
the Zoning Administrator except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, unless he/she receives a written order from the Board of Adjustment
in the form of an administrative review, special exception, or variance as
provided by this chapter.  A building permit shall not be required for an
alteration, repair or improvement which does not change the dimensional
outline of the building being so altered, repaired or improved.



3.   Application for Building Permit.



   A.   All applications for building permits shall include plans if
applicable in duplicate drawn to an appropriate scale, showing the actual
dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and
locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if any; and the location
and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration.



   B.   The application shall include such other information as
lawfully may be required by the Zoning Administrator, including existing or
proposed building or alterations; existing or proposed uses of the building
and land; the number of families, housekeeping units, or rental units the
building is designed to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such
other matters as may be necessary to determine conformance with, and provide
for the enforcement of this chapter.



   C.   One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the
Zoning Administrator, after he/she shall have marked such copy either as
approved or disapproved and attested to same by his/her signature on such
copy.  One copy of the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained by the
Zoning Administrator.



4.   Posting of Building Permits.  A building permit shall be posted by
the Building Official on the property in question prior to the start of
construction.  It shall be placed so that it is readable from the public
street, and shall remain in place during the construction period.  If a
building permit is not obtained and properly posted prior to construction,
construction must cease until such permit is granted.  The usual permit fee
will be doubled and other penalties may be levied.



5.   Certificates of Occupancy for New, Altered or Nonconforming Uses;
Temporary Certificates.  It is unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use
or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter
created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged
in its use or structure until a certificate of occupancy shall have been
issued therefor by the Zoning Administrator, stating that the proposed use of
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter.  Pending
the issuance of a regular certificate of occupancy, a temporary certificate
of occupancy may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six (6)
months from the date of issuance and to permit partial occupancy of the
premises during completion of the construction.  Such temporary certificates
of occupancy shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective
rights, duties or obligations of any other matter covered by this chapter. 
Such temporary certificates of occupancy shall not be issued except under
such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the
occupants.



6.   Expiration of Building Permit.



   A.   If the work described in any building permit has not begun
within 180 days from the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire;
it shall be canceled by the Zoning Administrator; and written notice thereof
shall be given to the persons affected.



   B.   If the work described in any building permit has not been
substantially completed within two years of the date of issuance thereof,
said permit shall expire and be canceled by the Zoning Administrator, and
written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected, together with
notice that further work as described in the canceled permit shall not
proceed unless and until a new building permit has been obtained.



   C.   The expiration date of a building permit may be established for
a period longer than two years if established at the time that such permit is
issued by the City.  The Zoning Administrator may, at his/her discretion,
extend the expiration period of the building permit.



7.   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Applications, Plans,
Permits, and Certificates of Occupancy.  Building permits or certificates of
zoning compliance issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by
the Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement or construction.  Use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed violation of this chapter, and
punishable as provided herein.



165.41  SCHEDULE OF FEES, CHARGES AND EXPENSES.



The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses
and a collection procedure for building permits, certificates of zoning
compliance, appeals, and other matters pertaining to this chapter.  The
schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the Zoning Administrator,
and may be altered or amended only by the City Council.  Until all
applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action

165.42  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



1.   Establishment.  A Board of Adjustment is hereby established.  The
Board shall consist of seven (7) regular members unless additional members
are added per Iowa Code Chapter 414 relating to extraterritorial
jurisdiction.  Each member shall be appointed by the City Council for terms
as provided by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa and is removable for cause by the
City Council upon written charges and after public hearings.  Vacancies
shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes
vacant.  The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules and regulations as
authorized or required by this chapter and the Code of Iowa.  Meetings shall
be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board
may determine.  Such Chairperson, or in his/her absence, the acting
Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
All meetings and records shall be open to the public.  The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each
question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact.  The Board
shall keep a record of its examinations and other official actions, all of
which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator
and shall be a public record.  The presence of a majority of the entire
Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.



2.   Procedure for Appeals. 



   A.   Appeals shall be made to the Board of Adjustment through the
office of the Zoning Administrator in written form as determined by the
Zoning Administrator.  The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal and shall decide the appeal within thirty (30) days of the date
of the public hearing.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board that by
reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.



   B.   Notices.  The Zoning Administrator shall provide a notice of a
public hearing on any question before it by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Pella at least ten (10) days before and no
more than twenty (20) days before the date of public hearing.  The Zoning
Administrator shall post an agenda in City Hall and at the location of the
meeting prior to the Board of Adjustment meeting.  The Zoning Administrator
shall attempt to notify adjacent property owners within 200 feet of the
property in question by mail prior to the Board of Adjustment meeting. 
Failure to notify 100% of all adjacent property owners shall not stop Board
of Adjustment from considering the application request or acting on the
petition. 



   C.   Upon the public hearing, any party may appear in person or by
agent or attorney.  The concurring vote of a majority of the entire board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the
appellant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Zoning
Ordinance, or to effect any variation in such Zoning Ordinance.



   D.   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board that a
stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent danger to life, property, or
the public safety.  In such a case, the proceedings shall be stayed only by
a restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator.



   E.   The processing of special use permits shall follow the same
procedures for hearings and public notification as variance or administrative
review appeals.



(Ord. 628 – Sep. 03 Supp.)



165.43  POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



The Board of Adjustment shall have only the following powers and duties:



1.   Administrative Review.  To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decisions or determination
made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures.



2.   Special Use Permits.  To hear and decide the approval of
applications for special use permits, as provided by this chapter. 



3.   Variances to Relieve Hardships Relating to Property.  To authorize,
upon appeal, variances from the strict application of this chapter where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece
of property at the time of enactment of the zoning regulations; or by reason
of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional
situation or condition of such piece of property, such strict application
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property.



   A.   Requirements for Grant of a Variance.  No such variance shall
be authorized by the Board unless it finds that:




      (1)   Strict application of the zoning ordinance will produce
undue hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter.





      (2)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other
properties in the same zoning district and in the same vicinity.





      (3)   The authorization of such variance will not be of
substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district
will not be changed by the granting of the variance.





      (4)   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit or caprice.





      (5)   The condition or situation of the property concerned is
not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable a
general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.





      (6)   The granting of the variance will not cause substantial
detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and
purpose of any ordinance or resolution.





      (7)   The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return
from any use permitted by the regulations of the district in which the land
is located. Failure to yield a reasonable return may only be shown by proof
that the owner has been deprived of all beneficial or productive use of the
land in question. It is not sufficient merely to show that the value of the
land has been depreciated by the regulations or that a variance would permit
the owner to maintain a more profitable use.





(Ord. 921 - Aug. 17 Supp.)




   B.   Findings by Board.  The Board of Adjustment shall make
findings that the requirements of this section have been met by the applicant
for a variance.



   C.   Conditions for Grant of Variance.



      (1)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter.  Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable under this chapter.



      (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.



      (3)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district and non-permitted or nonconforming use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.



   D.   Board has Powers of Zoning Administrator on Appeals; Reversing
Decisions of Zoning Administrator.  In exercising the above mentioned
powers, the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity
with the terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decisions, or determination as ought to be
made, and to that end shall have the powers of the Zoning Administrator from
whom the appeal is taken.



   E.   The concurring vote of a majority of the entire Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination of
the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any
matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any
variation in the application of this chapter.



   F.   All meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be open to the
public.  The Zoning Administrator shall keep minutes of its proceedings,
showing the vote of each member on each question, or if absent or failing to
vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and
other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office
of the Zoning Administrator and shall be a public record.  The presence of a
majority of the entire Board shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.

decision and the vote of each member participating therein.



   H.   The Board of Adjustment may hear and review applications for
and authorize minor modifications from the requirements of this Code in
compliance with the applicable provisions set out below.



      (1)   The Board of Adjustment may hear and review applications
for and authorize minor modifications from the requirements of this Code in
compliance with the applicable provisions set out below.



         a.   Reduce the required minimum front and rear yard
setbacks for principal structures in the residential districts by no more
than five feet, based on the setback standards.



         b.   Reduce the required minimum interior and street
side setbacks for principal structures in the residential districts by no
more than two feet and five feet, respectively, based on the setback
standards in the district.



         c.   Increase the maximum height of a detached garage in
the residential districts to 20 feet or the height of the principal
structure, whichever is less, as measured at the midpoint of the roof slope
halfway between the top of the sidewall and peak of the structure.



         d.   Allow an addition to an existing legal
nonconforming structure to extend no closer to the property line than an
adjoining portion of the existing structure.



         e.   Allow an increase in the aggregate maximum size of
all accessory structures on a property by 15% above the square footage
requirements allowed in 165.30(3.E).  This minor modification does not apply
to cases where the principal structures are setback from the rear lot line by
200% or more of the minimum required rear yard for the district, as described
in 165.30(3.E)



         f.   Reduce the minimum required front, interior and

allow reconstruction of a historically accurate structure.



      (2)   Approval Criteria. The decision to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny an exception must recite the findings upon which the
approval or denial is based which shall include the following:



         a.   General Guidelines. The power to grant a minor
modification should be exercised under circumstances where approval of the
exception will maximize a property owner's use of property and better carry
out the intent of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan than strict adherence
to this Code.



         b.   Obligation of Applicant. A minor modification shall
not be approved unless the applicant establishes the existence of each of the
following conditions:



            i.   Granting the minor modification would be in
the public interest, meaning that the applicant must explain how the
modification will not: Adversely impact the land on which the minor
modification is requested and the surrounding properties; Substantially
increase the congestion of buildings, people, or motor vehicles; Endanger
public health or safety, or otherwise be materially detrimental to the
welfare of nearby neighbors or the public at large; Unduly tax public
utilities or governmental services; or Materially injure the enjoyment, use,
development, or value of the property in the vicinity.



            ii. The property in question will benefit by approval
of the minor modification without negatively impacting the neighborhood.

165.49  VACATING PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.



Any person who desires to acquire a public right-of-way (a street, alley or
easement) may petition the City of Pella to vacate and sell the property. 
The petition is first referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the
Zoning Administrator.  The Commission will hold a public hearing and provide
a recommendation to the City Council.  The City Council will make the final
decision.  A proposed vacation must be compatible with the Comprehensive
Plan in order to be approved.  Neighboring property owners and the general
public must not be adversely affected by the proposed vacation.  Outlined
below are the required procedures to vacate a public right-of-way.



1.   Preparing the Vacation Petition.



   A.   A petitioner should first discuss the proposal with the Zoning
Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator will inform the applicant of the
advisability of the vacation.



   B.   If the petitioner proposes to place any improvements on the
vacated property, said petitioner should check with the appropriate
authorities to ensure that public services can be provided or do not have to
be relocated.  Or the petitioner may be required to supply easements to the
appropriate utility providers for existing utilities.



   C.   The petitioner files a petition to vacate with the Zoning
Administrator.  A deposit per Chapter 171 of this Code of Ordinances must
accompany the petition.  The deposit will be applied toward the purchase of
the property if approved.  The deposit will not be returned if the petition
is denied.



   D.   Supporting information must be submitted with the petition:



      (1)   The legal description of the right-of-way to be vacated.



      (2)   A statement must be filed explaining why the petitioner
wishes to acquire the property.



      (3)   A map of the area must be provided.  The map must meet
the following requirements:



         a.   At least one copy must be submitted.  It should be
neatly drawn in black ink on a sheet of paper or mylar of 8½" by 11" or 8½"
by 14" in size.



         b.   The date, scale, and north point shall be shown.



         c.   Property lines of all parcels within 200 feet of
the boundaries of the area being petitioned shall be shown.  The names,
addresses and telephone numbers of the owners of these parcels shall be
included.



         d.   Property lines of the area to vacated shall be
shown in heavy outline.  Accurate dimensions for all property lines will be
shown.



         e.   All streets and alleys in the general area shall be
shown.  The widths of the rights-of-way shall be noted.



         f.   The existing zoning classification of all
properties shown on the plat shall be noted.



         g.   The name, address, and phone number of the person
filing the petition shall be shown.



         h.   The existing land use of all properties shown on
the plat will be noted.



2.   Processing the Petition.



   A.   City Staff reviews the Petition as well as any other affected
public or private utilities.



   B.   The Zoning Administrator advises the petitioner of any required
changes.



   C.   If the petitioner decides to proceed with the vacation, a
qualified real estate appraiser is contacted and asked to appraise the
proposed property.



   D.   The petitioner is advised of the appraised cost of the
property.  If the petitioner decides to proceed with the vacation, the item
is scheduled for the next Planning and Zoning Commission meeting.



   E.   The property owners within 200 feet of the area in petition are
notified.



   F.   A public hearing is held at the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   G.   A recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission
regarding the petition is sent to City Council.



3.   Finalization of the Petition.



   A.   The City Council will act on the vacation petition.  Three
readings of the resolution to vacate are required.



   B.   After the third reading, the property is then sold for the
appraised value to the petitioner.  If the Council is unable to reach an
agreement regarding the sale of the property to the petitioner, the Council
may advertise the land for public bid.  The highest bid received and
approved by the Council shall normally govern the sale of the property. 
However, the Council may reject all bids and re-advertise or hold the land in
abeyance for a future sale.



   C.   The City must receive full payment for the property prior to
transferring the deed.



165.50  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.



Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter, upon
conviction, shall be subject to penalty for violation of this Code of
Ordinances.  Each day that a violation is permitted to exist constitutes a
separate offense.  All departments, officials and employees of the City who
are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses, shall
issue no such permit or license for any use, structure or purpose if the same
would not conform to the provisions of this chapter.

166.03  AIRPORT ZONES.



In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Pella Municipal Airport.  Such zones
are shown on the Pella Municipal Airport FAR Part 77 Surface map consisting
of one sheet, prepared by Clapsaddle-Garber Associates, Inc., and dated
September 24, 1995, and revised September 25, 1998, which is attached to
Ordinance 490 and made a part hereof.  An area located in more than one of
the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitation.  The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:



1.   Larger Than Utility Runway Non-precision Instrument Approach Zone. 
The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly
to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet from the
primary surface.  Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of
the runway. 



2.   Transitional Zones.  The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces. 



3.   Horizontal Zone.  The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface
of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to
those arcs.  The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones. 



166.04  AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.



Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be erected, altered, or maintained,
and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a
height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such
zone.  Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of
the zones in question as follows:



1.   Utility Runway Non-precision Instrument Approach Zone.  Slopes
thirty-four feet (34') outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of
and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 



2.   Transitional Zones.  Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above
the airport elevation or at an elevation of 1,030 feet above mean sea
level.  In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides
of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where
they intersect the conical surface.  Where the precision instrument runway
approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height
limits sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at the
sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at ninety degree (90°) angles to
the extended runway centerline.



3.   Horizontal Zone.  Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at an elevation of 1,030 feet above mean sea level.



4.   Conical Zone.  Slopes twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the
airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport
elevation.



5.   Excepted Height Limitations.  Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or
growth of any tree to a height up to fifty feet (50') above the surface of
the land. 



166.05  USE RESTRICTIONS.



Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
the land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in
the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of
the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.



166.06  NONCONFORMING USES.



1.   Existing Structures.  The regulations prescribed by this chapter
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use.  Nothing contained
herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended
use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
to the effective date of such ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted.



2.   Marking and Lighting.  Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon
of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the City Engineer
to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction.  Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City. 



166.07  PERMITS.



1.   Future Uses.  Except as specifically provided in paragraphs A, B and
C of this subsection, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be
planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been
applied for and granted.  Each application for a permit shall indicate the
purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree
would conform to the regulations herein prescribed.  If such determination
is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.  No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a
variance has been approved in accordance with subsection 4 of this section.



   A.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy-five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except when such
tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.



   B.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at
a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75
feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure
would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.



   C.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.



Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in this chapter.



2.   Existing Uses.  No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.



3.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed.  Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree of structure has been
abandoned or more than fifty percent (50%) torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such
structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the Zoning Regulations.



4.   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the
regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the Board of Adjustment
for a variance from such regulations.  The application for variance shall be
accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.  Such variances shall be
allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of
the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will
not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the
spirit of this chapter.  Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the City of Pella
Airport Committee for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance.  If the Airport Committee does not respond to the application
within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on
its own to grant or deny said application.



5.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting.  Any permit or variance granted
may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate,
and maintain, at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be
necessary.  If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may
be modified to require the owner to permit the City, at its own expense, to
install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 



166.08  ENFORCEMENT.



It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce
the regulations prescribed herein.  Applications for permits and variances
shall be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form published for that
purpose.  Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. 
The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit tothe Board of Adjustment
all documents relating to an application for action by the Board of
Adjustment. 



166.09  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



There is hereby created a Board of Adjustment to have and exercise the
following powers:



1.   To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this
chapter.

This chapter may be known and cited as the Pella Subdivision Ordinance, and
shall be referred to herein as “this chapter.”



170.02  PURPOSE.




The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe minimum requirements for the
design and development of new subdivisions and re-subdivisions of land,
providing for the preliminary and final approval of such subdivisions; to
prescribe minimum requirements for plats of survey; and to provide for
enforcement of these regulations in accordance with Platting, Division and
Subdivision of Land (currently Chapter 354) of the Code of Iowa relating
thereto, and for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict therewith.  The
Council has adopted a Comprehensive Plan as a guide to the future development
of the City.  In accordance with said Comprehensive Plan the City Council
has adopted a Zoning Ordinance to assist in controlling the future
development of the City by regulating the uses of land, the size of lots, the
height and bulk of buildings, the density of population and the locations and
uses of buildings and structures for residences, commerce, industry and other
purposes, including the public welfare, health and safety. It is essential
that subdivisions and plats of surveys are coordinated with the Zoning
Ordinance for the purpose of guiding the future development of the City as
outlined in the Comprehensive Plan.  Further, in order to ensure integrity
of its infrastructure, the City has adopted the design standards and standard
specifications as defined herein, which the subdivision and/or plat of survey
design must follow.

conference shall be set by the Zoning Administrator and the Subdivider within
seven (7) days of the request by the Subdivider.



170.05  SKETCH PLAN.



1.   Intent.  The Sketch Plan is intended to be less detailed and more
conceptual than the Preliminary Plat so that major issues can be identified
at the conceptual level before the applicant prepares a Preliminary Plat. 
The Sketch Plan is required to examine the feasibility of a subdivision of
land including review of the schematic design, ability to obtain water,
sanitation, and electric service, location of environmentally sensitive areas
and hazards, sources of required public services, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, storm water management, applicability of Design Standards,
relationship to surrounding land uses, and conformance with the Zoning
Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan. 



2.   Sketch Plan Submittal Required.  The Subdivider shall submit the
required number of copies as determined by the Zoning Administrator of a
Sketch Plan for the area of land proposed to be subdivided prior to the
Pre-Application Conference. 



3.   Sketch Plan Contents.  A Sketch Plan shall contain, at a minimum,
the following information:



   A.   The name of the proposed subdivision;



   B.   The name, address, and other pertinent information about the
property owner and the Subdivider or other person preparing the Sketch Plan;

limited to the Zoning Administrator, Public Works Director, GIS/Engineering
Coordinator and City Engineer, shall review and comment upon the Sketch Plan,
taking into consideration the requirements of the Subdivision and Zoning
Ordinances and Comprehensive Plan and the best use of the tract or parcel
proposed to be subdivided.  The following design issues shall be considered:



   A.   The location and layout of any proposed streets or other public
ways;



   B.   The arrangement and size of any lots to be platted by the
proposed subdivision;

areas of land.



Neither the Subdivider nor the City shall be bound by any comments,
recommendations, determinations or decisions of City staff offered or made
during the Pre-Application Conference as the Sketch Plan is the conceptual
step before preliminary and final platting.  However, the Subdivider shall
take into consideration and be advised that staff comments generated during
Sketch Plan review may also be applicable per the requirements of this
chapter during Preliminary and Final Plat submittal.

Council unless it can be demonstrated that it meets or exceeds the design
standards and standard specifications.



1.   Acre Subdivision.  Whenever the area is divided into lots containing
one or more acres and the land could eventually be re-subdivided into smaller
building lots, consideration shall be given to the street and lot arrangement
of the original subdivision so that additional minor streets shall be opened
which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.



2.   Relation to Adjoining Street System.  The arrangement of streets in
new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the streets in
adjoining subdivisions, or for a proper intersection where said streets in

extensions of existing streets shall be the same.  Street names shall be
subject to Commission and City Council approval.  Street names shall follow
a logical progression in numbering wherever possible.



5.   Lots.



   A.   All side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street centerlines unless the Commission shall agree that a
variation to this requirement will provide for enhanced street and lot
arrangement.  Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential
to provide separation of residential development from major traffic arteries
or to overcome specific constraints of topography.



   B.   Lot dimensions and area shall conform to the requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance. 



   C.   Direct access from a street shall be provided for all lots.

watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the Subdivider
shall, at the Subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provisions for
straightening, widening or otherwise improving the channel in accordance with
County, State and Federal regulations.  The channel will be sufficient to
convey surface water from a storm event of a 100-year frequency.  The
Subdivider shall also provide and dedicate to the City an easement along each
side of the stream, which easement shall be for the purpose of widening,
improving or protecting the stream.  The width of such easement shall be
adequate to provide for conveyance of surface water runoff from a 100-year
frequency storm event and for any necessary channel relocation and
straightening, but in no case shall such easement be less than twenty feet
(20').

170.15  DESIGN STANDARDS FOR R1C AND DURE DISTRICTS (Optional Residential
Zoning Districts).



The design standards for the R1C and DURE Zoning Districts are reflective of
the fact that these districts require special parameters for infrastructure
design, in addition to or in lieu of the otherwise conventional standards
required in this chapter. 



1.   Alley Required.  In accordance with the Zoning Ordinance, Dutch
Residential District alleys are required for new developments in the R1C and
DURE Districts except where specifically exempted therein.



2.   Street and Alley Design Standards.  Street and alley design for
subdivisions in the R1C and DURE Districts shall be in accordance with the

   A.   Rectilinear Streets.  Rectilinear street layouts are
required.  However, curvilinear layouts may be permitted when designed with
street interconnections and terminal open space or public space vistas
provided that at least 50% of the streets are rectilinear. 



   B.   Cul-de-sacs Prohibited.  Cul-de-sacs are expressly prohibited
in R1C and DURE Districts.



   C.   Block Length and Pedestrian Connections.  Streets shall be
designed to have maximum lengths of 600 feet between four-way intersections
and maximum lengths of 600 feet before terminating at three-way “T”
intersections or angling off in a diagonal direction.  In no case, shall a
block be greater than 600 feet long.



   D.   Streets shall be laid out to promote pedestrian circulation and
ease of access from all points in the subdivision and to any adjacent mixed
use, commercial, civic or institutional areas and any adjacent
pedestrian/bike trails.



3.   Streetscape Standards.



   A.   Sidewalks and Crosswalks.  Sidewalks and crosswalks
constructed of brick pavers or rectangular flagstones are highly
encouraged.  Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be designed in accordance with
City standards.



   B.   Pedestrian Lighting.  Pedestrian lighting shall be required. 
The developer shall install light fixtures consistent with good engineering
practices and with approval of the Electric Department.  Light fixture
design shall be consistent with pedestrian lighting generally found elsewhere
in the City.



4.   Utility Service Locations.  Utility service locations for R1C and
DURE Districts shall be in accordance with R1C and DURE District Utility
Service Locations schematic available at Public Works.



170.16  CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS (Option for Residential Subdivisions).



The purpose of this section is to permit the development of conservation
residential subdivisions in which buildings and dwellings are grouped closer
together and on smaller sized lots than otherwise permitted per this
chapter.  The concept of conservation subdivision design will provide for
flexibility in subdivision design to fit the natural characteristics of the
land and will permit more usable open space, common ground and recreational
areas.  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to
any other section of this chapter.  However, all other sections of this
chapter shall apply to conservation subdivisions unless specifically exempted
by this section.  The district requirements may be varied provided that
adequate open space shall be included to insure that the average land area
per dwelling unit shall be equal to or greater than that permitted for the
district in which the development is located.  The following provisions
apply:



1.   Open space, common ground or recreational areas shall be provided for
the use and benefit of the family dwelling units in the development.



2.   All lots in the conservation subdivision must abut or have direct
access to open space, common ground or recreational areas.



3.   The total land area of the development divided by the total number of
dwelling units provides an average land area per family dwelling unit. 
Total land area of the development shall include all open space, common
ground, and recreation areas, but shall not include land set aside for ponds,
lakes or detention ponds within the subdivision, or the traffic surface area
of subdivision roads.



4.   In no case shall approval be granted to developments which include
lots containing less than fifty percent (50%) of the minimum lot area
required by the Zoning Ordinance.



5.   As a condition of approving the conservation subdivision and
permitting exceptions to the standard subdivision requirements, the
subdivider shall submit with the final plat a subdivider’s agreement
regarding the liability for and maintenance of the open space, common ground
or recreation areas.  A statement shall be included on the final plat
indicating the open space covenants and designating the entity that maintains
and enforces the covenants. 



170.17  VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS FOR UNUSUAL CONDITIONS.



Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in this chapter would result in
substantial hardships or injustices, the City Council, upon written
recommendation of the Commission, may modify or waive such requirements. 
Any variations and exceptions granted hereunder shall be in harmony with the
intended spirit of this chapter, granted with a view toward protecting the
public welfare and interest of the City and surrounding area, and not be in
violation of the Zoning Ordinance.



170.18  FEES.



Before a preliminary plat shall be considered by the Commission, the
Subdivider or agent shall pay a fee in accordance with the schedule of fees
as adopted from time to time by resolution of the City Council.  A receipt
of such filing fee shall be filed with the preliminary plat.  Before a final
plat will be considered by the Commission, the Subdivider or agent shall pay
a fee in accordance with the schedule of fees as adopted from time to time by
the resolution of the City Council.  A receipt of such filing fee shall be
filed with the final plat.



170.19  ENFORCEMENT.



1.   No plat of any subdivision or plat of survey shall be entitled to be
recorded in the County Recorder's office or have any validity until it shall
have been approved in the manner prescribed herein.




(Ord. 734 - Feb. 07 Supp.)





2.   A building permit shall not be issued for any structure on a lot in
any subdivision or parcel in any plat of survey, the plat of which has been
prepared after the date of the adoption of this chapter, but which has not
been approved in accordance with the provisions contained herein.  In the
case of a final plat where the plat has been approved by City Council but the
public improvements not yet installed and accepted, then only one building
permit for a single family home shall be issued.





(Ord. 782 - Nov. 08 Supp.)




3.   The City Council shall not permit any public improvements over which
it has any control to be made or any money to be expended for improvements in
any area that has been subdivided or upon any street that has been platted
after the date of the adoption of this chapter unless such subdivision or
street has been approved in accordance with the provisions contained herein. 



170.20    CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.



Any regulation or provision of this chapter may be changed and amended from
time to time by the City Council; provided, however, such changes and
amendments shall not become effective until after study and report by the
Commission and until public hearings have been held by both the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council, public notice of which shall have been
given in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten (10)
days but not more than twenty (20) days prior to such hearing. 



170.21  GREEN SPACE CONSERVATION.



1.   Plat Application.  For purposes of this section the term a Plat
Application shall mean any presentation or filing with the City for
residential development purposes of any subdivision of land over which the
City has subdivision review including subdivisions with the City limits and
two mile extraterritorial jurisdiction.  The term City's Plan shall mean the
Comprehensive Plan or Parks Master Plan, whichever is the most current
official document.



2.   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following terms used
herein are defined as follows:



   A.   "Conservation Subdivision:"  A subdivision designed with the
same overall land use densities but using smaller lots and combined with land
reserved for open space per Section 170.16 of the Subdivision Regulations
resulting in additional green space preservation.



   B.   "Greenway Easement:"  An easement for greenway which may
include trees, drainage ways, and other nature features where such greenways
are identified in the Comprehensive Plan or Parks Master Plan, whichever is
most current and approved by City Council.



   C.   "Trail Easement:"  An easement for bicycle, pedestrian, or
other recreational trail where such trails are identified in the
Comprehensive Plan or Parks Master Plan, whichever is most current and
approved by City Council.



3.   Voluntary Park Land Dedication.  All persons making a Plat
Application may voluntarily dedicate to the City, within the land covered by
the Plat Application, land for park and recreational purposes subject to City
approval.  For purposes of this section the water area of ponds, streams,
retention basins, detention basins and other bodies of water shall not be
included in any area dedicated for parkland except that dry detention areas
or areas which may be subject to flooding but are normally dry may be
considered for voluntary park land dedication.



   A.   If land dedication under this section requires an amendment to
the Comprehensive Plan, the need for such an amendment will be reported to
the Parks Commission which shall make a recommendation to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council on the Plat Application.



   B.   The voluntary land dedication under this section may also be
done when the person making the Plat Application provides public access by
easement to recreational facilities,  play grounds, unobstructed open
spaces, ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts,
volleyball courts, picnic shelters, recreational trails and other similar
non-duplicated recreational facilities which have been (or will be)
constructed and maintained by the Applicant and are not shown on the City's
Plan. 



4.   Trail Easement and Green Space Conservation Requirements. 



   A.   Trail Easement.  A minimum twenty foot (20') wide easement for
recreational trail shall be provided where a trail is identified in the
Comprehensive Plan or Parks Master Plan. Trail easements must be continuous
and provide for connection to adjacent properties. 



   B.   Greenway Easement.  A greenway easement shall be provided
where greenways are identified in the Comprehensive Plan or Parks Master Plan
in no case less than forty feet (40') in width except where greenways abut
adjacent properties in which case forty foot (40') easement at minimum is
required for each property.  Greenway easements must be continuous except
for streets or right-of-way, provide for connection to adjacent properties,
and contain tree and green space protection measures.



   C.   Conservation Subdivision - Planned Unit Development.  Where a
proposed subdivision is adjacent to Big Rock Park (displayed as the lined
area on Exhibit A, on file at City Hall), then a conservation subdivision
shall be required pursuant to Section 170.16 of this chapter.  In addition,
a Planned Unit Development (PUD) shall be required pursuant to Section 165.14
of the Zoning Regulations.  As part of this PUD protection of existing trees
and open space through the conservation subdivision, common areas and through
buffer conservation easements along the perimeter of Big Rock Park shall be
required. 



5.   Dedication of Park Land Minimum.  Where park land is to be
voluntarily dedicated, it shall in no case be less than 1 acre in size.



6.   City Review of Park Land or Green Space Dedication.  The City does
not under this section have to accept land for dedication or green space. 
In any event, the Parks Commission shall review and make recommendation to
the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.  In no case shall the
City be permitted to accept any money, fee or financial contribution but
rather only land and/or easements as herein specified.



7.   Exceptions.  This section shall not apply to any Plat Application in
the following instances:



   A.   The Plat contains three or fewer single family residential
units.  A person making or filing a Plat Application shall not divide land
into separate plats in order to seek a waiver under this provision.  Where a
Plat Application is made for multiple contiguous tracts within any two years
the City may treat all the Plat Applications as one for purposes of this
section. 



   B.   The Plat area is zoned either A1 Agricultural or RR Rural
Residential and all of the lots in the subdivision would be at least 1 acre
in size.



8.   Appeal Procedure.

   A.   Any person making or filing a Plat Application or any person,
entity, or developer affected by any decision made by any department acting
under this section, may appeal to the City Council by filing notice of appeal
with the City Clerk.  Such appeal shall be taken within ten (10) days from
the decision of the department acting under this section and shall set out in
detail the reasons and grounds for the appeal. The City Clerk shall forthwith
transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appeal is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the appeal.



   B.   Public Hearings: The City Council shall upon the filing of an
appeal fix a reasonable time for a hearing, giving public notice thereof as
well as due notice to the parties in interest. All interested persons may

of four (4) members of the City Council may affirm, modify, or reverse any
decision of any department acting under this section.



   C.   Parks Commission Review: Prior to the public hearing on appeal

the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council for consideration at the
public hearing.



   D.   Planning and Zoning Commission Review: Prior to the public
hearing on appeal before the City Council, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall review the decision of any department acting under this section and
shall make a recommendation to the City Council for consideration at the
public hearing.



   E.   Appeal To The District Court: Any person, entity, or developer
aggrieved by any appeal decision of the City Council may within thirty (30)
days from the date of the City Council rendering a decision, appeal there
from to the District Court of Marion County, Iowa, in accordance with the
Rules of Civil Procedure, Division XIV, entitled "Certiorari."



This section shall take effect when approved and published as provided by
law.  Any Plat Application accepted into the City development review
process, and the land which is the subject of the review, submitted prior to
the effective date of the ordinance codified by this section shall be exempt
from the requirements of this section.



9.   Effective Date.  This section shall become effective July 1, 2009.

APPENDIX TO CODE OF ORDINANCES



USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.



DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES



1.   OFFICIAL COPY.



The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City
Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.” 



2.   DISTRIBUTION.



Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all
persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to
ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such
as the City Library, County Law Library and perhaps the schools.



3.   SALE.



The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended as
experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in
outdated codes being used or misused. 



4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.



The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current
record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances.  Each official,
elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all
documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including
this Code of Ordinances.   



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])



NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed.  For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances was No. 163, we would suggest that
the first ordinance passed changing, adding to or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164; the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and
so on.  We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for
the numbering of ordinances.



RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES



Please note that two books should be maintained:  (1) the Code of
Ordinances, and (2) an ordinance book.  We will assist in the maintenance of
the Code of Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and
returning appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to
accommodate ordinances amending the Code.  The City Clerk is responsible for
maintaining the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each
ordinance adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted
in the ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.



SUPPLEMENT RECORD



A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided
in the front of the Code.  This record will indicate the number and date of
the ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code.  For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance.  A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure
that all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.



DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS



Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent
to the Clerk.  It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person
having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be
properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.



AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date
of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts. 
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
