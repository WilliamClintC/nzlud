GETTING STARTED
OVERVIEW
1
SECTION 1 GETTING STARTED
1.A. OVERVIEW
1. The Zoning Map, which is part of these Regulations, divides Hebron into different zoning districts.
2. These Zoning Regulations identify what is permitted within the different zoning districts.
3. The uses and activities permitted in the different zoning districts and other commonly sought information may
be found by determining what zone a specific property is in (see the maps in the Appendix of these
Regulations) and then referring to the provisions for the specific district (Sections 2 - 4 of the Regulations).
4. Some activities will be subject to the Standards sections in the Regulations and these requirements or
limitations may be found there (Sections 5 - 6).
5. If a permit or approval is required, the application requirements can be found in the Procedures section of the
Regulations (Section 7).
6. Regulatory language and definitions of terms used in the Regulations are located in the back of the Regulations
(Sections 8 - 9).
Section 1.B
GETTING STARTED
KEY CONCEPTS
2
1.B. KEY CONCEPTS
1. The Regulations have been adopted to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general
welfare of the community.
2. The Regulations are constructed so that, if something is not clearly permitted, it is prohibited.
3. The Regulations generally establish minimum requirements although they can also establish maximum
limitations.
4. If there is any question about whether something is permitted, the Director of Planning can provide guidance.
If necessary, an informal discussion with the Planning and Zoning Commission as provided in Section 7.B may
be requested through the Director of Planning.
From the Zoning Map, identify the zoning district for the
property you are interested in.
Then, go the section of the Zoning Regulations related
to that district to learn about applicable provisions.
Maps showing the location of different zoning districts
are contained in the Appendix. In addition, the Zoning
Map is available on-line at:
www.hebronct.com
Section 2.A
RESIDENCE DISTRICTS & USES
PURPOSES

SECTION 2 RESIDENCE DISTRICTS & USES
2.A. PURPOSES
1. The various residential districts are intended to provide suitable areas for residential use and development
appropriate to the environmental characteristics of the land (such as soil types, terrain, and infrastructure
capacity) and the character of the area.
2. The differentiation among the residential districts is intended to provide for variety in the size and density of
residential neighborhoods and a diversity of housing opportunities after consideration of soil types, terrain,
and infrastructure capacity.
3. The residential districts may allow for certain non-residential uses when it can be demonstrated that they will
be appropriate for the location proposed in accordance with the standards contained in these Regulations.
4. In addition, the Amston Lake district contains special requirements intended to manage development in the
drainage basin in order to protect Amston Lake from environmental and ecological deterioration. These
requirements are the result of various studies conducted by the Town and are considered necessary to protect
public health and welfare and manage development in an environmentally sensitive area.

2.G. USE-RELATED PROVISIONS
2.G.1 CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT
2.G.1.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
Conservation Development patterns for residential subdivisions are encouraged in Hebron in order to:
? encourage preservation of open space, farmland and farmland soils, and community character;
? encourage variation in residential developments that would not otherwise be possible;
? encourage or require the use of flexible site design so that development will be constructed in harmony with
natural resources and the natural capability of the land; and
? permit residential developments that are sensitive to parcel configuration, topography, natural resources,
historic resources, character resources, solar access, and the surrounding area.
2.G.1.2 DETERMINATION OF MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LOTS
The maximum number of lots that may be approved in a Conservation Development shall be determined by one of the
following methods:
1. Mathematical Approach (Septic)
a. Determine “net land area” which shall be the parcel area minus:
? watercourses, waterbodies, ponds, streams;
? 100-year floodplains;
? wetlands; and
? areas with pre-development grades in excess of twenty percent (20%).
b. Divide the net land area by the minimum lot size required in the zoning district.
c. Multiply this result by 0.75 to reflect the open space set-aside requirement, the amount of area required for
road access, and for configurational loss in a conventional subdivision.
d. The result of this calculation, rounded to the nearest whole number, shall represent the maximum number of
lots permitted in the Conservation Development.
2. Mathematical Approach (Sewer)
a. Determine “net land area” which shall be the parcel area minus:
? watercourses, waterbodies, ponds, streams;
? 100-year floodplains;
? wetlands; and
? areas with pre-development grades in excess of twenty percent (20%).
b. Multiply the net land area by 2.5 units/acre.
c. The result of this calculation, rounded to the nearest whole number, shall represent the maximum number of
lots permitted in the Conservation Development.
3. Site Suitability - Alternatively, the developer may conduct on-site soil testing and prepare a sketch plan

3.C. VILLAGE SQUARE (VS)
3.C.1 PURPOSE
3.C.1.1 OVERALL
The Village Square District is intended to promote flexible development patterns and a diverse land use mix within
a master-planned environment in order to promote efficient use of the land; reinforce the historic development
patterns that have occurred within Hebron Center; protect and enhance natural resources; and provide a variety of
compatible architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within a planned development.
3.C.1.2 SUB-DISTRICTS
The Village Square District consists of three distinct components as shown on the Master Concept Plan:
1. Village Square Center - The Village Square Center component is intended to serve as the focal point and
gathering place of the master-planned environment centered on a village green. This area is expected to
contain shops and services, civil uses and buildings, and other uses to meet the daily needs of village residents
and convenience needs of town residents and may also contain residences. Retail, services and other active,
pedestrian oriented, uses will be encouraged on the first floor immediately proximate to the village green.
Residential and service uses will be encouraged on second floors or just outside the village green area.
2. Village Square General - The Village Square General component is intended to be an area where larger retail
and office uses are permitted and where employment areas may be located while still containing design and
locational elements that are compatible to the Village Square Center and to a traditional New England village.
This area is expected to contain retail/service and employment uses to serve the community-wide needs of
Hebron, but not be of such a scale or size to serve any regional-wide shopping needs. The entire Village
Square General area also will be encouraged to integrate residential uses to the maximum extent possible to
encourage a walkable, active environment.
3. Village Square Edge - The Village Square Edge component is intended to be the least dense area of the Village
Square District. This area is expected to contain primarily residential, civic, recreational and open space uses.
It provides a discernible boundary for the Village Square District, preserves natural features, accommodates
greenways as shown in the Plan of Conservation and Development, contains buffer areas along the edge of the
District, and ensures compatibility with the surrounding uses in Hebron Center by serving as the transitional
area of the Village Square District.

SPECIAL DISTRICTS
FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT
93
SECTION 4 SPECIAL DISTRICTS
4.A. FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT
4.A.1 PURPOSE
The Flood Hazard Overlay District is intended to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. The flood hazard areas of the Town of
Hebron are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
4.A.2 NATURE OF DISTRICT
1. As a “restrictive” overlay district, the requirements of the Flood Hazard Overlay District apply in addition to the
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
2. The degree of flood protection required by this Regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
Regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted in
such areas will be free from flooding and flood damages.
3. This Regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Hebron or by any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Regulation or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
4. The Town of Hebron, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for another person’s reliance on any
maps, data or information provided by the Town of Hebron.

1. These Regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Hebron.
2. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for the Town of Hebron, Connecticut, dated March 18, 1991 and accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated March 18, 1991, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of
Hebron, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
Regulation.
3. Since such mapping is legally adopted by reference into this Regulation it takes precedence until such time as a
map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The areas of special flood hazard includes any area
shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Areas of special
flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the FIS
for a community. BFEs provided on a FIRM are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified
with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. A Development Permit shall be required in
conformance with the provisions of this Regulation prior to commencement of any development activities.

Start Of Construction (Includes Substantial Improvement) - The date the Building Permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial
improvement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such
as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Structure - A walled and roofed building which is principally above ground, including a manufactured home, a gas

its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement - Any combination or repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure,
taking place during a ten (10) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. The market
value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair
or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure required to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (2) any
alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a “historic structure”.
Variance - A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management Regulation that allows
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
Violation - Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain
management Regulations. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor
elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Water Surface Elevation - The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other
datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.

4.A.6.2 SPECIFIC STANDARDS
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in Section 4.A.3
or as determined in Section 4.A.5, the following provisions, in addition to those in Section 4.A.6.1, are required:
1. Residential Structures - New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
2. Non-Residential Structures - New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
non-residential structure located in a special flood hazard area shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation.
3. Floodproofing - Non-residential structures located in all A and AE Zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being
elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure
below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect
of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design,
specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection.
4. Elevated Buildings - New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed
to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: (a) provide a
minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding (b) the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade
(c) openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit
the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
5. Manufactured Homes - In all areas of special flood hazard, all manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly
placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated
so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home
must also meet all the construction standards per Section 4.A.6.1. This includes areas of special flood hazard
outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a
result of a flood. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within an area of special flood hazard shall either:
a. be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (by
virtue of being on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and with no permanently attached additions); or
b. meet all the general standards of Section 4.A.6.1.1 and the elevation requirements outlined above in this
Section.

6. If Floodway Not Designated - In A and AE Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but
before a floodway is designated, required that no new construction, substantial improvement, or other
development (including fill) be permitted which would increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at
any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the
proposed development.
7. Aboveground Storage Tanks - Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or
inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be
securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill and
vent pipes extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood
water.
8. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone - If any portion of a structure lies within the area of special flood hazard,
the entire structure is considered to be in the area of special flood hazard. The entire structure must meet the
construction requirements of the flood zone. For the purposes of this Section, structure includes any habitable
and fully enclosed portions of the structure, not to include decks or porches.
9. Structures in Two Flood Zones - If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards
of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure
must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or
any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone
will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
10. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water - New construction, substantial improvements and repair to
structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over
water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility.
4.A.6.3 FLOODWAYS
1. In areas where floodways have been determined, encroachments (including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments) are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional
engineer is provided (with supporting technical data) demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
(0.00) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. When utilizing data other than that provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the a registered
professional engineer shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen
for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the
water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any one point.

of this Regulation.
4.A.8.1 SPECIFIC SITUATION VARIANCES
1. Buildings On An Historic Register - Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places without regard to the procedure set forth in the remainder of this Section, except for Subsection
4.A.8.3, and provided that no renovations or alterations may be made to an historical structure without due
consideration and effort to incorporate design concepts which, while preserving the historical character of the
building, will also serve to reduce the potential for future flood damage and threat to human life and property.
2. Preexisting, Small Lot Location - Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with Subsection 4.A.8.3.
3. Functional Dependent Uses - Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement and
other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage, create no additional threat to public safety

4.A.8.2 CONSIDERATION FOR GRANTING OF FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT VARIANCES
1. In passing upon such applications, the ZBA shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of these Regulations, and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage
on the individual owner;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Town's Plan of Development and floodplain management
program for that area;
i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the
effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.

conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Regulation.
4.A.8.3 CONDITIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT VARIANCES
1. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief, and in the instance of an historical building, a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building;
2. Variance shall only be issued upon:
a. a showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between
the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

4.B. GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY (GPO) DISTRICT
4.B.1 PURPOSE
The Groundwater Protection Overlay (GPO) District is intended to protect an extensive deposit of coarse grained,
stratified drift which is a significant geologic resource and an existing and potential water supply source for the
Town. As ground waters have been shown to be easily, and in many cases, irrevocably contaminated by many
common land uses, it is imperative that all reasonable controls over land use, waste disposal and material storage
be conscientiously exercised.
4.B.2 NATURE OF DISTRICT
1. As a “restrictive” overlay district, the requirements of the Groundwater Protection Overlay (GPO) District apply
in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district.
2. Single family dwellings are exempt from these Groundwater Protection Overlay (GPO) District regulations.
4.B.3 BOUNDARY OF DISTRICT
1. As shown on the zoning map, the Groundwater Protection Overlay (GPO) District encompasses the Raymond
Brook Marsh and all land directly up-gradient in Hebron.
2. If the boundary or extent of this District is in dispute, the burden of proof shall be upon the person or entity
disputing such boundary to show where it should be located. Such proof shall be in the form of a map,
prepared by a professional engineer and land surveyor, at a scale of 1 inch to forty feet, with two feet contours,
showing the existing district boundary and that proposed.

traps may also be required; and
f. for on-site disposal of sewage in quantities in excess of 2000 gallons per day, documentation from the
wastewater discharge permit granting authority that such system meets all applicable codes and
regulations.
2. A Special Permit required under this Section shall be granted only if the Planning and Zoning Commission
determines:
a. if existing ground water quality is now suitable for drinking water purposes, that the ground water quality
resulting from on-site wastewater disposal or other operations on-site shall not cause degradation of
ground waters outside any authorized zone of influence which would result in a condition which renders
the ground waters unsuitable for direct human consumption; or
b. if existing ground water quality is not now suitable for drinking water purposes, that on-site disposal or

4.C. MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT
4.C.1 PURPOSE
The Mixed Use Overlay District is intended to allow the integration of a variety of housing into the Town Center, and
other business districts, in village-style development in keeping with the scale and character of the Town, under
design standards that minimize conflict and enhance synergy between the various types of land uses.
4.C.2 NATURE OF DISTRICT
1. As a “permissive” overlay district, the Mixed Use Overlay District allows alternative forms of development,
including mixed use development and including multi-family dwellings and attached housing in different
patterns, which are not otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district.
2. Prior to submitting a formal application, a potential applicant is encouraged to:
a. discuss the development concept in detail with the Director of Planning and Development and other Town
staff as appropriate;
b. schedule an informal discussion with the Planning and Zoning Commission through the Director of
Planning and Development;

? cluster-type developments of sufficient scale to be oriented to an internal system of private roads,
drives, parking and pedestrian amenities to utilize a different setback.
b. Residential uses shall not generally be permitted on the ground level floor of any building, except that the
Commission may allow a residential use on the ground level of a building located more than one hundred
and fifty (150) feet from the Street Line when it finds, based on information submitted by the applicant,
that:
? the site and building plans foster a true, functionally-integrated mixed use concept, rather than the
mere location of residential and commercial buildings in the same development; and
? the residential uses are augmenting, and not displacing, the commercial uses for which the Town
Center, and other business districts, should be primarily dedicated and reserved; and
? the safety and quality of life for residents will be enhanced by the use of first floor levels for
residential use.
c. The maximum square foot size for any building proposed in the Mixed Use Overlay District shall be 20,000
SF unless the Commission finds that a larger building:
? better creates a street presence essential to a Main Street;
? the design of the building meets the design guidelines for large scale buildings by breaking up mass,
articulating the façade and by incorporating elements that add interest and human scale; or
? amenities have been provided to the site design which enhances the pedestrian environment in
connection with the building.
2. Within the Hebron Green (HG) District -
a. In addition to complying with the Design Standards in the Regulations, any new building or addition to an
existing building as part of a Mixed Use Development shall be compatible in scale, size, height and

3. Building / Site Design -
a. The design of all buildings shall be in accordance with the design guidelines incorporated in Section 5.A of
these Regulations.
b. The development plan shall integrate residential and non-residential uses so that they share the site in
harmony and so that parking areas, landscaped areas, and other site amenities benefit all the uses on the
site.
c. Mixed use should involve designing the site so that the residential and non-residential components are
part of a common design that allows the various uses to function together. Massing of residential
buildings to the rear of the site and non-residential buildings to the front of the site is not “mixed use,”
and merely creates an apartment block behind a strip commercial center.
d. Two story buildings are encouraged in the Mixed Use Overlay District. The Commission may approve a
cluster development with a mix of building of various heights, provided the Commission finds that the
overall plan complies with the design guidelines incorporated in Section 5.A of these Regulations and that
such variation is essential to the overall design theme of the development.
e. The Commission may require a higher first floor height for single-story development to create a
compatibility of façade heights where a mix of one and two-story buildings occur in proximity to each
other in a unified development.
f. Each residential unit shall have direct access to a private outdoor balcony, porch or patio space.
g. Each residential unit shall have unobstructed direct access to the outside separate from any business
activity.
h. Soundproofing shall be designed and installed to isolate the normal sounds of business activity from the
residential uses.
4. Curb Cuts:
a. Driveways onto Streets shall be minimized, and shall be designed to serve existing or future uses on
adjacent sites.
5. Parking:
a. Parking lots shall be designed to interconnect with existing or future parking lots on adjacent sites.
b. Provisions shall be made for parking spaces reserved for residents so that customers of commercial uses
on the site do not occupy parking spaces that are most convenient to residential access points.
c. As the intent of this Overlay District is to provide for a mixture of land uses and flexibility to encourage the
long term sustainability of these developments, in lieu of the parking requirements found is Section 5.C all
mixed use developments shall provide parking at the rate of 5 spaces per 1,000 SF. and 2 spaces per
residential dwelling unit.
d. These parking requirements may be reduced by up to 25 percent when exemplary pedestrian connections
are provided within the site and to adjacent business and public facilities and when:
? the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that the mix of uses on the site
(such as residential, office, and retail) will experience peak parking demands at different times of the
day and day of week so that the full complement of parking spaces will not be necessary; and/or
? the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that a “shared parking”
arrangement with one or more adjacent properties (based on a suitable parking management plan
and legal agreement, recorded on the land records, assuring the continued availability of the shared
parking spaces on the affected properties for the life of the proposed development or use) will mean
that the combined sites will experience peak parking demands at different times of the day and day of
week so that the full complement of parking spaces will not be necessary.

meeting the requirements of Section 5.D of these Regulations as well as the design guidelines incorporated
in Section 5.A of these Regulations.
7. Phasing -
a. So that a mixed-use development occurs during all phase of development:
? Building Permits for more than 50% of the residential units in the approved MUOD development may
not be issued unless Building Permits have been issued for at least 40% of the total non-residential
gross floor area;
? certificates of occupancy for more than 50% of the residential units in the approved MUOD
development may not be issued unless Certificates of Occupancy have been issued for at least 40% of
the total non-residential gross floor area;
? certificates of occupancy for the full number of residential units in the approved MUOD development
may not be issued unless Certificates of Occupancy have been issued for at least 60% of the total nonresidential
gross floor area; and
? certificates of occupancy for uses in the approved MUOD development shall only be issued in
proportion to the overall completion of required site improvements including utilities, parking,
landscaping, and other amenities.
4.C.5 DECISION CONSIDERATIONS
1. In approving a Special Permit for a Mixed Use Development as defined in these Regulations, the Commission
shall consider whether the Commission finds that:
a. the requirements of this Section of the Regulations, and the Special Permit standards and criteria of
Section 7.D are satisfied in accordance with the intent of the underlying District;
b. the mixed-use and higher density development can be located on the specific parcel in a manner that is
compatible to the surrounding neighborhood;
c. the residential and mixed-uses will enhance the design of the buildings or the site;
d. the proposed design and layout meets the intent of the design guidelines incorporated in Section 5.A of
these Regulations;
e. the need exists within the Town for a different type of housing unit than is permitted under conventional
zoning and there is a documented need for the number and type of market rate and/or affordable housing
units suggested; and
f. the proposed mixed-use development will allow the integration of a variety of housing into the Town
Center or other business districts, in village-style development in keeping with the scale and character of
the Town, under design standards that minimize conflict between varying uses and enhances synergy
between the various types of land uses.

5.P.1 PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this Regulation to enable the siting of commercial wireless telecommunication sites within the
Town of Hebron while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing any adverse effects through careful design, siting
and screening.
In Connecticut, certain telecommunication facilities may be regulated exclusively by the Connecticut Siting Council
(CSC) or the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA).
Connecticut Siting Council - As provided in Chapter 277a of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS Section 16-50g
et seq.), the Connecticut Siting Council regulates telecommunications towers owned or operated by the state, a
public service company, certified telecommunications provider or used in a cellular system including:
a. establishment of new towers (or built to support telecommunications antennae),
b. co-location of new antennae on existing CSC-regulated towers,
c. modification of approved CSC-regulated towers; and
d. applications to attach small cell antenna systems to a new structure, an electric transmission pole or other
freestanding structure.
Public Utilities Regulatory Authority – As provided in Chapter 283 of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS
Section 16-228 et seq.), the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regulates the placement of small cell antenna
systems or other similar telecommunication facilities on utility poles (including a replacement or convenience
poles) that are part of the electric distribution system.
The Planning and Zoning Commission has jurisdiction over municipally-owned towers and building-mounted
antennae.

Management Plan requirements, including design practices
and technical standards, to be incorporated in the planning,
design, construction and maintenance of development
proposals, redevelopment proposals and other activities that
change the land surface and alter hydrologic conditions that
can result in potential pollution and adverse impacts to the
surface water, groundwater and other natural resources of
the Town of Hebron.
It is not the intent of these Regulations to abrogate or
impair the requirements of other local, State or Federal
laws, regulations and/or permit programs.

Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 98, 124, 126, 440,
444, and 446h of the General Statutes of the State of
Connecticut as amended, the Town of Hebron Planning and
Zoning Commission adopts these Regulations governing
the management of stormwater.
c) Applicability
A Stormwater Management Plan shall be prepared for all
development proposals, redevelopment proposals and other
activities except as noted below.
When submission of an application for approval and/or a
permit to the Planning and Zoning Commission of the
Town of Hebron is required for a development proposal,
redevelopment proposal or other activity, a Stormwater
Management Plan shall be included as supporting
information to the application.
d) Exemptions
i. Upon written request, the Commission may waive
these Regulations in whole or in part, when the
development proposal, redevelopment proposal or
other activity will, upon completion, disturb less
than one (1) acre of land surface and have less than
10% of impervious surface, or where due to special
conditions related to the site or vicinity of the
proposal or activity, the requirements of these
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
5.0-11
Regulations, in whole or in part, may not be
technically feasible.
(Note: Any development or redevelopment which
calls for a total of over 5 acres also requires the
submission of registration to the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection under the
General Permit for the Discharge of Stormwater and
Dewatering Wastewaters from Construction
Activities.)
ii. No waiver request shall be approved that would
cause an adverse impact to the surface water,
groundwater and other natural resources of the
Town of Hebron. The Applicant shall demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Commission that approval
of a waiver request will meet this standard.
iii. Activities defined as Agricultural Uses shall be
exempt from these regulations.
e) Separability

achieved.
Additional design practices and/or technical standards may be
required to be incorporated in the Stormwater Management Plan
by the Commission and the Town Planner and Town Engineer
acting as the Commission’s administrative agents, where the
proposal or activity will discharge stormwater runoff to an area
identified as a sensitive surface water, groundwater or other natural
resource, or to an area identified as impaired and/or experiencing
existing flooding, stream channel instability or water quality
problems.
a) Site planning and design practices, best management
practices (especially those referred to as non-structural
practices) and practices referred to as Low Impact
Development (LID) techniques intended to mitigate the
effects of changes to the land surface or hydrologic
conditions shall be considered in the design of a
development proposal, redevelopment proposal or other
activity.
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION

The guidance and recommendations regarding site design
practices, best management practices and LID techniques
given in the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual,
as amended shall be the minimum practices and techniques
considered.
Additional resources regarding these practices and
techniques can be found in the Additional Information
Sources and References sections of Chapter Four – Site
Planning and Design, of the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater
Quality Manual, as amended.
b) Stormwater Infiltration
The guidance and recommendations given in the 2004
Connecticut stormwater Quality Manual, as amended, shall
be the minimum used in the design of stormwater
infiltration structures, facilities, practices and techniques.
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
5.0-26
i. Where stormwater runoff is proposed to be
infiltrated into natural soils and/or fill material,
investigations shall be made of the hydrogeologic
conditions of the site an din the vicinity of the
proposed infiltration practices, technique, structure
or facility, including field testing to determine soil
infiltration rates under pre-development soil and
groundwater conditions and to estimate infiltration
rates under post-development soil and groundwater
conditions.
ii. If a stormwater infiltration practice, technique,
structure or facility is also intended to function to
control peak rates of discharge of stormwater
runoff, the practice, technique, structure or facility
shall be designed in accordance with the
recommendations and guidance given in the
Connecticut Department of Transportation Drainage
Manual, as amended, as well as the 2004
Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual.

year, 50-year and 100-year post-development peak
discharge rates shall not exceed the corresponding predevelopment
peak discharge rates.
i. The Commission may waive the peak runoff
attenuation criteria for sites that discharge directly
to a large stream (fourth order or greater) where the
development area is less than 5 percent of the
watershed area upstream of the development site.
ii. NRCS peak flow calculation methods such as TR-
55 or TR-20 shall be used to compute peak flows.
iii. Where existing or new open earthen channels are
proposed as part of the on-site stormwater
management facilities, the Applicant shall either:
1) Reduce the post-development,

redevelopment or other activity 2-year, 24
hour peak flow rate to the 1-year, 24-hour
predevelopment rate.
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
5.0-27
d) Downstream Analysis
A downstream analysis shall be performed to identify
potential detrimental effects of proposed stormwater
treatment practices and detention facilities on downstream
areas.
i. The downstream analysis should include the
following elements:
1) Flow routing calculations shall proceed
downstream to a confluence point where the
site drainage area represents 10 percent of
the total drainage area.
2) Calculation of peak flows, velocities, and
hydraulic effects at critical downstream
locations (stream confluence, culverts, other
channel constructions, and flood-prone
areas) to the confluence point where the 10
percent rule applies.
3) The analysis should use an appropriate
hydrograph routing method, such as TR-20,
to route the pre- and post-development
runoff hydrographs from the project site to
the downstream critical locations.
4) Where the results of the downstream
analysis indicates that the proposed
stormwater management plan will result in
an increase in peak flow in the receiving
stream downstream of the site, due to the
delayed onset of peak outflow from a
stormwater detention basin coinciding with
the peak discharge in the receiving stream,
adequate stormwater runoff control measure
shall be designed and constructed to prevent
such increase in peak flow.
ii. Adequacy of Existing Downstream Stormwater
Facilities to Accept Concentrated Stormwater
Runoff:
1) Where site and design conditions are such
that concentrated stormwater runoff
resulting from post-development,
redevelopment or other activity is proposed
to be discharged to or through any manmade
or natural channel, downstream
stormwater collection and conveyance
system, culvert, bridge or other hydraulic
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
5.0-28
facility, the adequacy of the existing
facilities to convey such flows shall be
verified.
2) Where it is determined that any existing
downstream man-made or natural channel is
experiencing channel instability, flooding, or
water quality problems under existing
conditions or will be hydraulically
inadequate to accept the 2-year, 24-hour
recurrence interval peak flow resulting from
post-development, redevelopment or other
activity, the Applicant shall either:
a) Reduce the post development,
redevelopment or other activity 2-
year, 24-hour peak flow rate to 50%
of the 2-year, 24-hour
predevelopment rate, or
b) Reduce the 2-year, 24-hour peak
flow rate to the 1-year, 24-hour
predevelopment rate.
c) The requirements of a) and b) above
do not apply where the developed
site contains less than one acre of
impervious cover or where the
stormwater runoff discharges to a
fourth order or greater stream or
water body where the area of the site
is less than 5 percent of the
watershed area upstream of the site
unless known water quality problems
exist in the receiving waters.
3) Where it is determined that any existing
downstream closed conduit stormwater
collection and conveyance system will by
hydraulically inadequate to accept the 10-
year, 24-hour recurrence interval peak flow
resulting from post-development,
redevelopment or other activity without
being surcharged, the Applicant shall
develop a stormwater management plan that
will attenuate the post-development,
redevelopment or other activity 10-year
recurrence interval peak rate of discharge to
that experienced under existing conditions.
4) Where it is determined that any existing
downstream culvert or bridge providing for
SECTION 5.0 SUBDIVISION APPLICATION
5.0-29
the drainage from a watershed less than one
square mile in area in which there is an
established watercourse will be
hydraulically inadequate to accept the 25-
year, 24-hour recurrence interval peak flow
resulting from post-development,
redevelopment or other activity without
flooding or damaging the highway or
adjacent property, the Applicant shall
develop a stormwater management plan that
will attenuate the post-development,
redevelopment or other activity 25-year
recurrence interval peak rate of discharge to
that experienced under existing conditions.
5) Where it is determined that any existing
downstream culvert or bridge providing for
the drainage from a watershed less than one
square mile in area in which there is an
established watercourse will be
hydraulically inadequate to accept the 50-
year, 24-hour recurrence interval peak flow
resulting from post-development,
redevelopment or other activity without
flooding or damaging the highway or
adjacent property, the Applicant shall
develop a stormwater management plan that
will attenuate the post-development,
redevelopment or other activity 50-year
recurrence interval peak rate of discharge to
that experienced under existing conditions.
6) Where it is determined that any existing
downstream culvert or bridge providing for
the drainage from a watershed one square
mile or larger in area will be hydraulically
inadequate to accept the 100-year, 24-hour
recurrence interval peak flow resulting from
post-development, redevelopment or other
activity with at least one foot of underclearance
relative to the low chord of the
upstream face of the structure and not create
a backwater that will flood or endanger
property or roads upstream, the Applicant
shall develop a stormwater management
plan that will attenuate the postdevelopment,
redevelopment or other
activity 100-year recurrence interval peak

Subdivision Regulations regarding the prevention or
minimization of erosion and the transport and
deposition of sediment shall also be incorporated in
the Stormwater Management Plan. Where such
requirements conflict with the requirements for the
Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control or other requirements of these
regulations, the more stringent requirements, as
determined by the Commission, shall govern.
8) Operation and Maintenance

SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-4
6.5 EXISTING STREETS
A. If the Commission finds that a subdivision abutting or gaining access from an
existing town road which does not meet Town road standards will adversely effect
the health, safety or welfare of vehicular or pedestrian traffic due to poor sight lines,
inadequate drainage or inadequate pavement and pavement widths, then the
Commission may require the subdivider to improve the existing street based on the
current road and drainage standards (see Section 13) and classification.
B. Existing Town roads have been classified as listed in Appendix A.
C. In order to determine the level of improvements required, the subdivider shall
prepare a plan and profile of the existing abutting street(s) and prepare an
improvement plan adhering to the standards of Section 13.
D. The Commission may modify the standards contained within Section 13 for
improvements to existing roads to preserve the unique character of the Town’s rural
streetscapes consistent with the policies in the Plan of Conservation and
Development where such modifications can occur without adversely affecting public
safety. Such modifications shall be made only after considering the
recommendations of the Town Engineer and the Director of Public Works.
E. In the case where the abutting existing road has been designated a “Scenic Road”

A. Design of Storm drainage systems shall be in accordance with the Stormwater
Management Plan requirements of Section 5.5 and based on the design guidance
provided in that section.
B. In general, roadway drainage conveyance systems shall be of closed pipe with
surface inlet structures. However, in certain applications, the Commission may
consider an alternative open drainage system that incorporates off-road swales in lieu
of catch basins and piping. The acceptability of such a system shall be site specific
and based on the existing physical conditions and proposed development plans. The
factors in determining the suitability of such a system, and the required design
standards, are as outlined in Section 13.7.A.2 of the Public Improvement
Specifications and Plate 6. Where proposed storm drainage conveyance systems
within a subdivision extend beyond the town road right-of-way, the Commission
shall require the reservation of sufficient easements for storm drainage to be granted

B. Location of Open Space
Open Space shall be located within all subdivisions (except as provided in Section
6.10H. or 6.10I) in a specific location as determined by the Commission where such
open space will best further the purpose of the Open Space.
The Commission. as part of its determination, may take into consideration: (a) if any
particular location may be adequate to existing or proposed open space or other
property owned by the Town, a land trust or other similar entity; or (b) if any
particular location is along the boundary of adjoining undeveloped land so that the
Open Space may be potentially expanded if that adjoining parcel is the subject of a
future subdivision application.
The Commission may require review of all proposed open space by the Recreation
Commission, the Conservation Commission or a land trust which could be the open
space recipient prior to subdivision approval.
C. Size of Open Space
The minimum required area of open space shall be twenty percent (20%) of the total
area of the land to be subdivided, adjusted as set forth in Section 6.10.E.2, and shall
be of such size as deemed appropriate by the Commission so that the Open Space
will achieve the purpose intended as noted in Section 6.10 and serves the increased
density of population resulting from the subdivision and serves to achieve the goals
and objects of the Plan of Conservation and Development.
D. Open Space Standards
1) Calculations: Unless specifically waived by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the
Commission, the minimum required Open Space as per Section 6.10.C shall
not include land designated as inland wetland soils nor slopes in excess of 30
percent; and, the Commission, to permit the inclusion of these areas, shall
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-9
find that proposed open space accomplishes the goals and findings of The
Natural Resources Inventory and the Town of Hebron Plan of Conservation
and Development.
2) Access: Such open space shall have access from a public street, with such
access at least 40 feet wide and having a maximum grade of 15%, or shall
abut existing open space having such access, unless specifically waived by
the Commission due to the unique characteristics of the open space or
subdivision.
3) Condition: Any land to be dedicated as Open Space (except open space set
aside for parks, playgrounds or other outdoor recreational facilities) shall be
left in its natural state by the subdivider, except for improvements as may be
required by the Commission, and shall not be graded, cleared, disturbed, or
used as a repository for stumps, brush, earth, building materials, or debris.
Open space for parks, playgrounds or other outdoor recreational areas and
facilities shall be provided in a condition suitable for the purpose intended.
The Commission may require such open space area to be graded by the
subdivider to properly dispose of surface water, that it be seeded with
appropriate perennial grass, and that all brush and debris be removed. Such
improvement of open spaces will not be required until the subdivision is
substantially completed.
4) Open Space in Phased Developments: If the entire parcel is not to be
subdivided at one time, or where the land to be subdivided is adjacent to
other land of the applicant, or adjacent to land owned by the owner of the
land to be subdivided, the Commission will review the entire tract(s) to
determine the location of the Open Space. The Commission shall utilize
among other information, the plan required by Section 5.1A of these
Regulations.
E. Dedication of Open Space
The Open Space shall be dedicated by any of the following methods listed in this
Section, as determined by the Commission; and, the Town shall consider any such
dedication as satisfying the Open Space requirements of this Regulation and of
Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
1) Method of Dedication: Permanent dedication of each such area of open
space shall be accomplished by a) conveyance of fee simple ownership to the
Town of Hebron; b) creation of a Conservation Easement in favor of the
Town of Hebron; c) creation of a Conservation Easement in favor of the
Town of Hebron reserving specific agricultural rights as approved by the
Commission; d) conveyance of fee simple ownership to a Tax-Exempt
Organization approved by the Commission; e) creation of a Conservation
Easement in favor of a Tax-Exempt Organization approved by the
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-10
Commission; f) conveyance of fee simple ownership to a Connecticut nonstock
corporation of which all owners of land within the subdivision are
members, along with a conservation easement over the entire open space
area; or g) any other method which accomplishes permanent dedication in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this Section. The Commission
may require dedication of open space by methods listed in a, b, c. or f of this
paragraph; and the Commission may require dedication by methods listed in
d, e, or g with the consent of the applicant. Any such dedication, regardless
of the method used, shall be completed prior to the endorsement and filing of
the final subdivision plans in the office of the Town Clerk. Any conveyance
of an interest in the dedicated open space shall convey to the grantee good
and marketable title to the premises, and unless otherwise specified by the
Commission, shall be free of all encumbrances or defects.
2) Schedule of Open Space Credits:
Method Adjusted Average Value*
a) Conveyance of Fee Simple Ownership
to the Town of Hebron (1.0)
b) Any approved Conservation Easement to
the Town of Hebron (0.5)
c) Conveyance of Fee Simple Ownership
to Tax Exempt Organization (1.0)
d) Conservation Easement in favor
of Tax Exempt Organization (0.5)
e) Conveyance of Fee Simple Ownership
to Connecticut Non-Stock Corp. (0.5)
*Adjusted Average Value, meaning that each type of open space is given a
value based upon the extent of public access allowed thereto. Each acre so
dedicated shall be multiplied by its AAV to determine its proportionate value
in satisfying the overall open space requirement.
3) General: When any dedication of Open Space is made as per Section
6.10.E.1.e (Convey once to a Connecticut non-stock corporation), the deed,
declaration, or other instrument transferring interest in the property shall be
in a form acceptable to the Town, and shall provide, at a minimum:
a) That all such covenants or restricts shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of all present and future owners of the land within the
subdivision;
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-11
b) That such covenants or restrictions may be enforced by each present
and future owner of land within the subdivision and also by the Town
by appropriate action in court for damages or for affirmative or
negative equitable relief;
c) That the rights and duties created by such covenants or restrictions
shall not in any way be modified or amended without the prior written
approval of the Commission; and
d) That if at any time maintenance, preservation or use of such open
space area shall not comply with or fulfill the provisions of such
covenants, or restrictions, the Town may, at its election, take any and
all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to assure or enforce
compliance and to assess against the owners of land within the
subdivision, either jointly, or severally, all costs incurred by the Town
for such purposes.
4) Evidence of Acceptance: If Open Space is to be dedicated to an entity other

marked by iron pins or monuments as required for all other parcels as noted in
Section 6.11 of these Regulations.
The Commission may require the applicant to post identification plaques, provided
by the Town, on trees, fences or posts, each 50 ft. along the edge of the Open Space
as visual identification of these areas to future residents.
G. Legal Transfer
Properly executed legal documents, including warranty deeds for any title transfers,
shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Section and shall be
submitted with the final subdivision map to be endorsed and filed. All warranty
deeds shall be accompanied by a certificate of title, prepared by an attorney admitted
to the bar of the State of Connecticut, certifying that such conveyance passes good
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-12
title to the described property or property interest, and that it is free and clear of any
defect or encumbrances, or that any such encumbrance has been subordinated to the
conveyance. All documents must be acceptable to the Commission and its attorney,
and shall refer to the subdivision maps by title. All warranty deeds for dedication of
land to the Town shall be held in escrow by the Commission to be recorded on the
Town Land Records upon acceptance by the Board of Selectmen. In the event that
acceptance is rejected by the Board of Selectmen, the deed shall be returned and the
subdivider shall return to the Commission for determination of an alternative means
of preserving the Open Space. In no case, shall the acceptance of any deed by the
Commission or an employee of the Town be deemed as acceptance of the Open
Space by the Town.
H. Fee-in-lieu of Open Space
As set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission
may authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the Town, or pay a fee to the Town and
transfer land to the Town in lieu of the full requirement to provide open space as set
forth above. Such authorization may be granted by the Commission if and when it
determines in its sole discretion, that conditions such as subdivision size, population
densities, existing open space in the neighborhood, topography, soils or other
characteristics are such that on-site open space is not as desirable as a fee-in-lieu of
open space.
1) Amount. Such fee or combination of fee and the fair market of land
transferred shall be equal to not more than ten percent (10%) of the fair
market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the
subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser
jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant, with the cost of all
appraisal fees and expenses borne by the applicant.
2) Procedure. To employ the fee-in-lieu of open space option, the following
procedure shall be used:
a) The applicant shall submit a narrative to the Commission setting forth
his desire to utilize the provisions of Section 6.10.H.
b) The Commission shall determine whether to accept the applicant’s
proposal, or to accept a different combination of land transfer and fee,
or to require an open space dedication only.
c) The Commission and applicant shall jointly select an appraiser to
submit a report. Steps (a) through (c) may be accomplished at the
application acceptance portion of the process.
d) The applicant shall submit the appraisal during the formal application
review process.
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-13
e) The Commission, as part of the action on the applicant, shall either
accept the fee-in-lieu proposal, a combination of fee and land transfer
proposal, or require an open space dedication.
f) The Commission may deem a transfer of land to a Land Trust, or
other similar non-profit entity organized to reserve land in its natural
state, as a satisfaction of the applicant’s obligation to transfer land to
the municipality.
3) Payment. The method of payment of any fees under this Section shall be one
of the following two options:
a) The applicant, at his option, may submit the entire fee in one lump
sum prior to the filing of subdivision mylars with the Town Clerk; or
b) The applicant may elect to submit a fraction of such payment, the
numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the
number of approved building lots in the subdivision, no later than the
time of the sale of each approved building lot; and a notation
describing this requirement shall be placed on the final subdivision
map filed in the Town Clerk’s office. If this option is chosen, the
applicant shall submit a bond or other security acceptable to the
Town, equal to the full amount of fee required, prior to the filing of
the subdivision maps in the Town Clerk’s office. Any required fees
shall be paid to the Town prior to the release of this bond. The
Commission may also choose other acceptable security such as a
mortgage or lien on the land to be subdivided. This mortgage or lien
shall secure the amount of the fee is paid.
c) No building permits shall be issued until such fractional part is paid as
to any lot in the subdivision.
I. Open Space Waiver
The Commission shall require open space in all subdivisions or shall require a fee-inlieu
of open space for all subdivisions. No waivers of this requirement shall be
granted except in the following instances as specifically required by Section 8-25 of
the Connecticut General Statutes:
1) Where the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) lots is to a
parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first
cousin of the property owner for no consideration. Such intended transfer
shall be evidenced by covenants, restrictions, contracts, or other legally
binding documents as the Commission may approve, which documents will
be filed in the Land Records along with the Subdivision Plan. If the
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-14
Commission determines, subsequent to the approval of such subdivision, that
such transfers were intended to be temporary, and for the sole purpose of
evading the requirements of this Section, the Commission may, following a
public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or
in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be
filed in the Land Records; and
2) Where the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, and defined in
Section 8-39a of the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty percent
(20%) or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision.
Such restrictions for affordable housing shall be evidenced by such
documents as the Commission may require, and such restrictions shall run
with the lots affected thereby in perpetuity. If, subsequent to approval of the
Subdivision, the lots designated for affordable housing shall not be sold for
that purpose, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by
certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision
approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records.
6.11 MONUMENTS
A. Monuments shall be placed at all angle points, points of curves in streets, and at
intermediate points on tangents over 600 feet in length, and shall be of concrete as
specified in Section 13.
B. Iron pins shall be installed at all lot corners, including all corners of all open space
and easements.
C. A building permit shall not be issued until required monumentation and corner pins
are in place.
6.12 STREET LIGHTING
A street light shall be erected at street intersections as required by the Commission for all
new subdivisions. See Public Improvement Specifications, Section 13.5N.
6.13 STREET TREES
The Commission shall require the planting of street trees in new subdivisions where any
portions of the development are devoid of existing mature (greater than six inches in caliper)
trees in proximity to the street. When selecting street trees, a mixture of native species trees
shall be provided as noted in Section 13.9B.2. Wherever feasible, large or significant trees
shall be preserved as a community asset. Trees to be planted shall be deciduous shade trees,
planted at a minimum of three (3) inches in caliper as measured one foot above finished
grade and be spaced approximately 75 feet apart and five (5) feet from the street property
line. The Commission may waive these requirements where unique conditions warrant.
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-15
6.14 STONE WALLS
Stone walls are a significant man-made feature important to the character of the community.
Proposed street, utility and future buildings shall be designed to preserve stone walls to the
maximum extent possible. The Commission may require conservation easements along
stone walls to ensure their future protection. The Commission may require the
reconstruction of significant stone walls by the subdivider where their preservation is not
possible.
6.15 AGRICULTURE BUFFER AREAS
Buffers adjacent to actively farmed land shall be established in residential subdivisions.
Said buffer areas, when required, shall be no less than fifty (50) feet in width and may be
required up to a width of one hundred (100) feet as directed by the Commission, depending
on the type of agriculture or farm use, the topography, existing vegetation and the proposed
design and planting of such areas. It shall be the responsibility of the developer, subject to
approval by the Commission, to provide an effective barrier that will reasonably protect
adjacent residential living areas. It shall be the responsibility of individual lot owners where
such buffers are established on their lots, to maintain the buffer in accordance with the
designed intent.
Such responsibility shall be specifically noted on the subdivision plan and in the deeds of
affected lots. Where a buffer area is part of a common open space, the responsibility for
maintenance will be assumed by a homeowners association or by other arrangement that is
acceptable to the Commission.
In addition, the following statement shall be noted on the subdivision plan: “This property
abuts or is in proximity to an active agricultural or farming operation which is a permitted
zoning use. The policy of the Town is to encourage agricultural uses, which are an integral
component of the existing community character. Agricultural operations sometimes emit
such things as noise, odor, dust or chemical spray drift that are unavoidable byproducts of
such operations.”
If abutting actively farmed land comes under development, then these requirements are
voided.
6.16 COMMON DRIVEWAYS
A. The Commission may require that lots in proposed subdivisions be served by
common driveways when it is determined that such arrangement better provide for
traffic safety or sight-line requirements or where it furthers the protection of natural
resources.
SECTION 6.0 DESIGN CRITERIA
6.0-16
B. Where a lot is served by a common driveway on another adjacent parcel, the
Subdivision Map shall contain a notation on the lot that access is only permitted to
the street via the common driveway as shown on the final approved plan.
C. Where a lot is served by a common driveway on another adjacent lot, the final
Subdivision Plan shall provide all necessary access, utility and construction
easements.
D. No more than two lots may be served by a common driveway.

INLAND WETLANDS AND
WATERCOURSE REGULATIONS
TOWN OF HEBRON,
CONNECTICUT
4
Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the Town of Hebron Connecticut are an
indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of
Hebron have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of
nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological
stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of
groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many
inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction
because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the
diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of
which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such
unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on
the environment and ecology of the Town of Hebron and has and will continue to imperil
the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and
recreational values and benefits of the Town for its citizens now and forever more. The
preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary,
undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and
is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the Town. It is, therefore,
the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions
for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and
watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving
water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish
and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the
natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution;
protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic,
esthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the
Town’s potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution,
misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the
economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its
environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the Town, the
safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and
enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the “Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Regulations of the Town of Hebron.”
1.3 The Conservation Commission of the Town of Hebron was established in accordance
with an ordinance adopted July 1, 1981 and shall implement the purposes and provisions
of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of
Hebron
5

Section 9
Public Hearings
9.1 The inland wetlands Agency shall not hold a public hearing on an application

have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a petition signed by at
least twenty-five persons who are eighteen years of age or older and who reside in
the municipality in which the regulated activity is proposed, requesting a hearing
is filed with the
Agency not later than fourteen days after the date of receipt of such
application, or the Agency finds that a public hearing regarding such
application would be in the public interest. The Agency may issue a permit
without a public hearing provided no petition provided for in this section is filed
with the Agency on or before the fourteenth day after the date of receipt of the
application. Such hearing shall be held no later than sixty-five days after the
receipt of such application. All applications and maps and documents related
thereto shall be open for public inspection. At such hearing any person or persons
may appear and be heard and may be represented by agent or by attorney.
9.2 Notice of the public hearing shall be published at least twice at intervals
of not less than two days, the first not more than fifteen days and not fewer than
ten days, and the last not less than two days before the date set for the hearing in a

the hearing record.
Section 10
Considerations for Decision
10.1 The Agency may consider the following in making its decision on an
application:
a. The application and it supporting documentation.
b. Public comment, evidence and testimony.
c. Reports from other agencies and commissions including but not
limited to the Town of Hebron:
l. Conservation Commission
2. Planning and Zoning Commission
3. Building Official
4. Health Officer
5. Town Engineer
6. Connecticut River Coastal Conservation District
7. Capitol Regional Council of Governments or other regional bodies
8. Agencies in adjacent municipalities which may be affected by the
proposed activity
9. Other technical agencies or organizations which may undertake
additional studies or investigations.
Non-receipt of comments from agencies and commissions listed in
subdivisions 10.1.c above within the prescribed time shall
neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Agency.
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of
sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes,
including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions
thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and
circumstances including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on
wetlands or watercourses;
b. the applicant’s purpose for, and any feasible and prudent
alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which
21
alternatives cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands
or watercourses;
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts
of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses
and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse
resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity,
including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability
to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures
which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such
activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize
pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing
environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore,
enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or
the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the
proposed regulated activity; and
f. impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses
outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities
associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity
which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which
may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding
by the Agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on
wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Agency finds on
the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In
making this finding the Agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set
forth in subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore
shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there
may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which
have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose
on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may
investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden
from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present
alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands or watercourses” includes aquatic,
plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) “habitats”
22
means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population
normally lives and occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands agency shall not deny or condition an application for
a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an
impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life unless such activity will likely
impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall
base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other
material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its
decision. A conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does
not create a presumption that a permit should be issued. The applicant has the
burden of demonstrating that his application is consistent with the purposes and
policies of these regulations and sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
Section 11
Decision Process and Permit
11.1 The Agency, or its duly authorized agent acting pursuant to Section 12 of these
regulations, may, in accordance with Section 10 of these regulations, grant the
application as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or
modifications of the regulated activity designed to carry out the purposes and
policies of the Act, or deny the application. Such terms may include any
reasonable measures which would mitigate the impacts of the regulated activity
and which would (a) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental
damage, (b) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (c) in the
following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or
watercourse resources.
11.2 No later than sixty-five (65) days after receipt of an application, the Agency may
hold a public hearing on such application. At such hearing any person or persons
may appear and be heard and may be represented by agent or attorney. The

of a public hearing. In the absence of a public hearing, action shall be taken on
applications within sixty-five (65) days from the date of receipt of the application.
The applicant may consent to one or more extensions of the periods specified in
this subdivision, provided the total extension of all such periods shall not be for
longer than sixty-five (65) days, or may withdraw the application. The failure of
the Agency to act within any time period specified in this subdivision, or any
extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of the application.
23
An application deemed incomplete by the Agency shall be withdrawn by the
applicant of denied by the Agency.
11.3 The Agency shall state upon its record the reasons and bases for its
decision and, in the case of any public hearing, such decision shall be based fully
on the record of such hearing and shall be in writing and shall, as applicable and
in accordance with section 10 of these regulations, incorporate a statement
relative to the consideration of feasible and prudent alternatives.
11.4 The Agency shall notify the applicant and any person entitled to such
notice of its decision within fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the Agency shall cause notice of its
order in issuance or denial of the permit, to be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in the town wherein the inland wetland or watercourse lies. In
any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen-day period, the
applicant may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days
thereafter.
11.5 If an activity authorized by an inland wetland permit also involves an
activity which requires a zoning or subdivision approval, special zoning permit, or
variance or special exception, under sections 8-3(g), 8-3c, or 8-26 of the
Connecticut General Statutes, the Agency shall file a copy of the decision and
report on the application with the Town of Hebron Planning and Zoning
Commission within fifteen days of the date of the decision thereon.
11.6 Any permit issued by the Agency for the development of land for which
an approval is required under section 8-3, 8-25 or 8-26 of the Connecticut General
Statutes shall be valid for five years provided the Agency may establish a specific
time period within which any regulated activity shall be conducted. Any permit
issued by the Agency for any other activity shall be valid for not less than two
years and not more than five years.
11.7 No permit issued by the Agency shall be assigned or transferred without the
written permission of the Agency.
11.8 If a bond or insurance is required in accordance with section 13 of these
regulations, the Agency may withhold issuing the permit until such bond or
insurance is provided.
11.9 General provisions in the issuance of all permits:
a. The Agency has relied in whole or in part on information provided
by the applicant and if such information subsequently proves to be false,
deceptive, incomplete or inaccurate, the permit may be modified,
suspended or revoked.
24
b. All permits issued by the Agency are subject to and do not derogate any
present or future rights or powers of the Agency or the Town of Hebron,
and convey no rights in real estate or material nor any exclusive
privileges, and are further subject to any and all public and private rights
and to any federal, state, and municipal laws or regulations pertinent to the
subject land or activity.
c. If the activity authorized by the Agency’s permit also involves an activity
which requires zoning or subdivision approval, special permit, variance or
special exception under sections 8.3(g), 8-3c, or 8-26 of the Connecticut
General Statutes, no work pursuant to the wetland permit may begin until
such approval is obtained.
d. In constructing the authorized activities, the permittee shall
implement such management practices consistent with the terms and
conditions of the permit as needed to control storm water discharges and
to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to otherwise prevent pollution or
wetlands and watercourses.
e. Permits are not transferable without the prior written consent of the
Agency.
Section 12
Action by Duly Authorized Agent
12.1 The Agency may delegate to its duly authorized agent the authority to
approve or extend an activity that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when
such agent finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater than a
minimal impact on any wetlands or watercourses provided such agent has
completed the comprehensive training program developed by the Commissioner
of Environmental Protection pursuant to section 22a-39 of the Connecticut
General Statutes. Requests for such approval shall be made on a form provided
by the Agency and shall contain the information listed under Section 7.5 of these
regulations and any other information the Agency may reasonable require.
Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing applications prescribed
in Sections 8, 9 and 11 of these regulations, such agent may approve or extend
such an activity at any time.
12.2 Any person receiving such approval from such agent shall, within ten days of the
date of such approval, publish, at the applicant’s expense, notice of the approval
in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town wherein the activity is
located or will have an effect. Any person may appeal such decision of such
25
agent to the Agency within fifteen days after the publication date of the notice and
the Agency shall consider such appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting
provided such meeting is no earlier than three business days after receipt by such
Agency or its agent of such appeal. Any person may appear and be heard at the
meeting held by the Agency to consider the subject appeal. The Agency shall, at
its discretion, sustain, alter, or reject the decision of its agent or require an
application for a permit in accordance with Section 7 of these regulations.
Section 13
Bond and Insurance
13.1 Upon approval of the application and prior to issuance of a permit, the applicant
may, at the discretion of the Agency, be required to file a bond with such surety in
such amount and in a form approved by the Agency.
13.2 The bond or surety shall be conditioned on compliance with all provisions of
these regulations and the terms, conditions and limitations established in the
permit.
Section 14
Enforcement
14.1 The Agency may appoint an agent or agents to act in its behalf with the authority
to inspect property, except a private residence, and issue notices of violation or
cease and desist orders and carry out other actions or investigations necessary for
the enforcement of these regulations. In carrying out the purposes of this section,
the Agency or its duly authorized agent shall take into consideration the criteria
for decision under section 10.2 of these regulations.
14.2 The Agency or its agent may make regular inspections, at reasonable hours, of all
regulated activities for which permits have been issued under these regulations.
14.3 If the Agency or its designated agent finds that any person is conducting or
maintaining any activity, facility or condition which is in violation of the Act or
these regulations, the Agency or its duly authorized agent may:
a. issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to
such person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or
condition. Within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of such order the
Agency shall hold a hearing to provide the person an opportunity to be
heard and show cause why the order should not remain in effect. The
26
Agency shall consider the facts presented at the hearing and within ten
(10) days of the completion of the hearing notify the person by certified
mail that the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in
effect, or that the order has been withdrawn. The Agency shall publish
notice of its decision in a newspaper having general circulation in the
municipality. The original order shall be effective upon issuance and shall

The issuance of an order pursuant to this subsection shall not delay or bar
an action pursuant to section 22a-44(b) of the Connecticut General
Statutes, as amended.
b. suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the permittee has not complied
with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has
exceeded the scope of the work as set forth in the application including
application plans. Prior to revoking or suspending any permit, the Agency
shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct which warrants the
intended action. The Agency shall hold a hearing to provide the permittee
an opportunity to show that it is in compliance with its permit and any and
all requirements for retention of the permit. The permittee shall be
notified of the Agency’s decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain a permit
by certified mail within fifteen (15) days of the date of its decision. The
Agency shall publish notice of the suspension or revocation in a
newspaper having general circulation in the municipality.
c. issue a notice of violation to such person conducting such activity or
maintaining such facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation,
the jurisdiction of the Agency, and prescribing the necessary action and
steps to correct the violation including, without limitation, halting work in
wetlands or water or watercourses. The Agency may request that the
individual appear at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Agency to
discuss the unauthorized activity, and/or provide a written reply to the
notice or file an application for the necessary permit. Failure to carry out
the action(s) directed in a notice of violation may result in issuance of the
order provided in subdivision 14.3.a or other enforcement proceedings as
provided by law.
Section 15
