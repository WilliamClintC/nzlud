1-213.          Code of ethics.

(a)   Declaration of Policy – The proper operation of city government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city.

The prohibitions contained in this section shall not apply to contracts let after competitive bidding has been solicited by published notice, and the contracts for property or services for which the price or rate is fixed by law.

(a)   When Owner Present. When the police department intends to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to section 14-302 and the owner of the motor vehicle is then present, the police department shall before the motor vehicle is removed, provide the owner with a notice, in the form prescribed by the police department that the motor vehicle is being impounded, that towing and storage charges will be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle, that the owner may claim and regain possession of the impounded motor vehicle at the location to which it is being removed for storage without prepayment of towing and storage charges and that the owner may request a hearing as to the propriety of the impoundment and as to the amount of and the owner’s liability for the towing and storage charges. The notice shall also state the location where the impounded motor vehicle will be stored and the place where the owner may make his or her request for the hearing. The notice shall also state, in prominent language, that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five days after receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of his or her right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner; and that the motor vehicle be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after 15 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner of the impounded motor vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that he or she has received a copy of the notice and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner.

(b)   When Owner not Present – When the police department impounds and removes a motor vehicle pursuant to section 14-302(a) and the owner of the motor vehicle is not present at the time of the impoundment, the police department shall, if such motor vehicle has displayed thereon a registration plate issued by the division of vehicles and has been registered with said division, mail a notice by certified mail to the registered owner thereof, addressed to the address as shown on the certificate of registration, and to the lienholder, if any, of record in the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state. The notice shall be in the form prescribed by the police department containing the same information as required by section 14-304(a). The police department shall use reasonable diligence in determining the title owner, or if from a non-title state, the registered owner of the vehicle, and shall inquire by mail of the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state, as to whether there are any lienholders of record. If the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed to be a resident of the state whose whereabouts are unknown and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

If the owner does not reside in the state, as appears from the motor vehicle registration and the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed a nonresident of the state and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

(c)   Failure or Refusal to Sign Notice. If any person required by this section to sign a notice of impoundment willfully fails or refuses to do so, or if such person cannot be found, the police department shall note this fact on the face of the notice, which shall constitute prima facie evidence of delivery or service of notice as required by this section.

The police department shall be immune from liability for any damage, loss or destruction of the motor vehicle occasioned by its being left unattended pursuant to the request of the owner or operator thereof, in lieu of impoundment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the police department to order the removal of a motor vehicle by its owner or operator or to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to section 14-304 at any time whenever in his or her judgment the presence of the unattended motor vehicle constitutes a danger to the public safety.  

(Code 1987)

14-306.       Release of motor vehicle from impoundment.

(a)   Generally. Unless the vehicle is impounded pursuant to section 14-302(b) herein, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership satisfactory to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored. If the custodian is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or his or her authorized agent, he or she shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or his or her agent. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police department nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release. At the same time as the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made with 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police department shall provide him or her an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount and his or her liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; provided, that if the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle more than 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and his or her liability for the towing and storage charges.

(b)   Security for Payment of Charges. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the Kansas Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the owner or his or her agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evidenced from the document establishing ownership, the owner or his or her agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle from impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or his or her agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges.  

(Code 1987)

14-307.       Hearing.

If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in section 14-306, a date shall be set, not more than five days after the date of request, for the hearing. The city attorney shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearings required by this section. At the hearing, the owner, his or her agent, or his or her attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his or her objections to (a) the impoundment of the motor vehicle and (b) (1) the amount of the towing and storage charges and (2) his or her liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or his or her agent requested the hearing more than five days but not more than 40 days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, his or her agent or his or her attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment: if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (b) below; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner’s objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner’s objections, the hearing examiner shall render his or her decision if the hearing examiner:

(a)   Finds that the impoundment was improper, he or she shall:

(1)   Find the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment and

(2)   Determine whether and to what extent the city shall bear the expense of the towing and storage charges; or

(b)   Finds that the impoundment was proper, he or she shall establish:

(1)   The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle and

(2)   The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, and a copy of the decision shall be furnished to the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored and to the city attorney.

        In the event that the impoundment was pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102(6), the owner or occupant of the real property upon which the abandoned vehicle was located shall not be assessed the costs of towing and storage of the vehicle. Further, nothing within this article shall be construed to modify or effect the validity of the possessory lien of the person removing such vehicle from the real property established by K.S.A. 8-1102(b).  

(Code 1987)

14-308.       Charges constitute a lien.

The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle pursuant to section 14-302 shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 14-307 that the impoundment was improper and if he or she determines that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 14-306 that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but he or she may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released pursuant to section 14-306(a). In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or his or her agent has provided security for payment of charges as required by section 14-306(b), the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section.  

(Code 1987)

14-309.       Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale.

The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle created by section 14-308, to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided in section 14-308 or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after 60 days from the date the motor vehicle is impounded by the police department. If the owner of the motor vehicle or his or her agent has provided security for the payment of the lien as provided in section 14-306(w), the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created pursuant to section 14-308 is still under impoundment 60 days from the date it is impounded by the police department and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1102. Publication, required by K.S.A. 8-1102, may be made before the termination of the 60 day period for a sale thereafter.  

(Code 1987)

14-310.       Redemption.

If the city is to conduct the sale:

(a)   Any holder of a recorded lien or retained title on a motor vehicle to be sold by the city under the provisions of section 14-309 may claim and take possession thereof, upon payment of accrued charges and estimated costs of publication of the notice of sale to the police department and the deposit with the police department of sufficient assurance by surety bond or otherwise, approved by the city attorney, that the motor vehicle will be forthcoming for public sale thereof or upon claim of the rightful owner prior to the sale. The police department shall, within three days, make a report to the city treasurer and deliver the charges and costs so paid to the city treasurer, taking a receipt therefore and filing it, together with a duplicate copy of the report to the city treasurer, with the records in his or her office. The funds shall be held in a trust account until final disposition of the motor vehicle. Not less than five days before the date for sale of the motor vehicle, the police department shall notify the lienholder or retained titleholder of the time and place for the sale, and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall deliver such motor vehicle to the police department at or before 12:00 noon of the day before the sale. At the sale the amount paid shall be credited on the bid of the lienholder or retained titleholder. If the lienholder or retained titleholder is the successful bidder for the motor vehicle, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and then the funds previously paid by the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be relieved of the trust previously impressed and become the same as other funds received by the city for storage and costs of impounded motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is sold for a higher bid to any person other than the lienholder or retained titleholder, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him out of the trust account.

(b)   And if the rightful owner of the motor vehicle claims the same before the sale by payment of the accrued charges, the police department shall immediately notify the lienholder or retained titleholder in possession of the motor vehicle and he or she shall return the same to the police department within 12 hours. The police department shall report this redemption by the rightful owner to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid to him or her out of the trust account.  

(Code 1987)

14-311.       Sale proceeds.

The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to section 14-308 whether such sale was conducted by the city or by any other person, after payment of the towing and storage charges and costs and expenses incident to the sale, shall be deposited with the city treasurer, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, for credit to the trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account pursuant to this section shall remain in the account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, but if no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the sale, the funds shall become the property of the city, be released from the trust account and be paid into the general fund as miscellaneous revenues.  

(Code 1987)

14-312.       Statutory procedures.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to augment, diminish, supersede or otherwise interfere with any statutory procedure established by the legislature for the collection of unpaid towing and storage charges. The procedures in this article are supplementary and cumulative to any statutory procedures.  

(Code 1987)

14-313.       Implementation of article.

If a lien created by section 14-308 and held by a private wrecker or towing firm is discharged by section 14-308 pursuant to a determination by a hearing examiner that an impoundment was improper and that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the city shall pay to the firm the amount determined by the hearing examiner. No payment shall be made until it is authorized by the city attorney.

15-111.       Maintenance of service line.

It shall be the responsibility of the city to maintain, repair or replace all water service lines from the city water main to the point of delivery.

(a)   Maintenance, as used in the article, includes:

(1)   The thawing of frozen water lines which are not plastic; or

(2)   The replacement of lines restricted by lime or other deposits so as to provide an inadequate supply of water, as determined by the superintendent, to the customer’s existing meter or property line, whichever is closer to the main.

(b)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to furnish and maintain the water service line from the point of delivery to the point of usage. The customer shall at his or her own expense repair, replace or move all such water service lines as may be required by the city to prevent loss to the city or damage to public property. No claim shall be allowed against the city by reason of the breaking, freezing or other malfunctioning of the private water line. In cases where the water meter is not located at the point of delivery, and where there is reasonable evidence that the water user’s existing service line is leaking between the point of delivery and the meter, the Water and Sewage Supervisor may authorize the installation of a meter and meter pit at the point of delivery and the cost of the meter pit shall be invoiced directly to the property owner.

(c)   The city shall not be responsible for the repair or replacement of any existing water line that has been disturbed, broken or exposed by any person, corporation or firm.

(d)   As a prerequisite to any liability of the city to maintain, repair or thaw any service line in the corporate limits of the city, it shall be the duty and responsibility of every customer having such water service in need of repair, maintenance or thawing to notify and receive approval from the city. Any repair, maintenance or thawing not specifically authorized by the city shall not be paid for by the city.  

 

15-112.       Increasing water line size.

The city shall not be responsible for any increase in the size of the water service line to the point of delivery and the owner shall pay all additional cost resulting from the replacement of any service line with a service line of greater diameter.

No person, company, corporation or institution shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the city may enter the supply and distributing system of the city unless specifically approved by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the governing body.  

(Ord. 1358, Sec. 1)

15-114.       Same; protective backflow devices required.

Approved devices to protect against backflow or backsiphonage shall be installed at all fixtures and equipment where backflow and/or backsiphonage may occur and where there is a hazard to the potable water supply in that polluted water or other contaminating materials may be pulled into the potable water supply piping following a reduction in pressure in the city piping. Any situation in which a heavy withdrawal of water, such as a sudden break in the main or water being used from a fire hydrant, may cause a negative pressure to develop which could lead to backsiphonage of polluted water into the system shall be improper and must be protected by approved backflow preventive valves and systems as determined by the Water and Sewage Supervisor. An owner of property shall have the necessary protective backflow devices installed prior to any new connections to the city’s public water supply system.  

(Ord. 1358, Sec. 1)

15-115.       Same; inspection.

The water and sewage supervisor or other designee of the governing body shall have the right of entry into any building or premises in the city as frequently as necessary in his or her judgment in order to ensure that plumbing has been installed in accordance with the laws of the city so as to prevent the possibility of pollution of the water supply of the city. Under KDHE order, the City shall enforce an annual inspection by a certified state inspector of all backflow preventors and cross connections. All property owners are required to have all cross connections and backflow preventors inspected annually. The city shall provide a list of certified inspectors and the required inspection form. All inspection forms shall be filed with the city clerk.  

 

15-116.       Same; protection from contaminants.

Pursuant to the city’s constitutional home rule authority and K.S.A. 65-163a, the city, by its water and sewage supervisor, may refuse to deliver water through pipes and mains to any premises where a condition exists which might lead to the contamination of the public water supply system and it may continue to refuse the delivery of water to the premises until that condition is remedied. In addition, the water and sewage supervisor may terminate water service to any property where the cross connections or backsiphonage condition creates, in the judgment of the supervisor, an emergency danger of pollution to the potable water of the city.  

(Ord. 1358, Sec. 1)

15-117.       Same; penalties and fines.

(a)   The city shall notify the owner, or authorized agent of the owner, of a building or premise in which there is found a violation of Sections 15-113 through 15-116 of such violation. The city shall set a reasonable time for the owner to have the violation corrected at the owner’s expense. If the owner fails to correct the violation within the specified time, the water and sewage supervisor shall cease delivery of water to the building or premise until the violation shall be satisfactorily corrected.

(b)   Violation of this article, as referenced in subparagraph (a) above, shall be a municipal offense and may be prosecuted in the municipal court. Any person found guilty of violating this article shall be guilty of a municipal offense. Each day’s violation shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty for an initial violation shall be a mandatory fine of $100.00. In addition, such owner may be required by the court to serve a term of confinement not to exceed 30 days. The penalty for a second or subsequent conviction shall be a mandatory fine of $200.00. In addition, such owner shall serve a term of confinement not to exceed 30 days.

(Ord. 1358, Sec. 1)

15-118.       Interruption of water services.

The city reserves the right to shut off at any time, without notice, the water supply in its mains to make repairs and extensions or for any other purpose, and all water users having boilers or hot water tanks within their premises not supplied with auxiliary tank and depending on pressure in the mains are cautioned against the danger of collapse or explosion.

(a)   The city shall not be liable for any damage done or for keeping the boilers supplied with water as a result of any accident or incident due to the lack of pressure, insufficient water supply, break in the mains or the shutting off of the water supply. No claim shall rest against the city or the water system by reason of any damage sustained from the freezing or bursting of any main, service pipe, stop-cock, valve or hydrant, or from the accidental failure to supply water, and the city hereby reserves the right to shut off water without notice for the purpose of making repairs or extensions and no claim for damage therefrom shall be allowed.  

(Ord. 1242, Sec. 12)

15-119.       Unlawful acts.

(a)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to place or lay any water line in the same trench as any sewer or gas lines.

(d)   No un-metered private hydrants shall be placed within the limits of any street or alley of the city.

(e)   It shall be a violation of this article for any person or persons to tamper with any water main, fire main, water meter, or to make any connection with the water system of the city without written permission from the city, or to reconnect service when it has been discontinued for nonpayment. The unauthorized restoration of such services shall be deemed an unclassified misdemeanor subject a fine of not less than $100 but not more than $500 and/or 30 days in jail.  

(Ord. 1242, Sec. 13)

15-120.       Maintenance services rendered.

(a)   City water department maintenance personnel are employed to maintain the municipal water system from the water source to the point of delivery. The personnel are not to perform services for water users unless one of the following criteria is met:

Article 3. Stormwater Regulations

15-301.       Purpose and intent of stormwater management.

In order to reduce property damage, minimize siltation and soil erosion, and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding, and in order to provide for basic protections to the quality of water in the various streams, drainage channels, ponds and reservoirs in the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Marysville, these regulations set forth below shall hereinafter be applicable to all the following instances, except as noted.

(a)   Subdivision of land, where the total platted area exceeds two (2) acres, and/or where the total impermeable surface area upon full development, including streets, parking lots, buildings, drives and sidewalks is estimated to exceed one half (1/2) acre; development for multiple-family dwellings; development for more than two (2) dwelling units on a lot or adjoining lots; development of all residential districts allowed under Article 10 of the Uniform Land Development Code; and commercial, industrial or other types of non-residential development having a total site impermeable surface area of more than one half (1/2) acre, including, but not limited to such features as roofs, driveways and sidewalks.

(b)   Such regulations shall not apply to:

(1)   Construction of any building or future improvements on a site, which have been previously provided with approved stormwater management control facilities as a part of a larger unit of development.

(2)   Remodeling, repair, replacement and improvements to any existing structure or facility that does not cause an increase in the impermeable surface area by more than one half (1/2) acre.

(3)   Development where it can be demonstrated by a study, conducted by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas, that the detention of stormwater runoff or other measures referenced herein would be detrimental to the drainage basin or would provide no benefit to development downstream. Only such specified measure(s) shall be rendered inapplicable to the subject development.

(4)   Development in the C-1 and C-2 districts.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

15–302.       Stormwater management plan.

Developers shall submit, along with the preliminary plat, or plans for development of a site or building, a storm water management plan, prepared by an engineer duly licensed by the State of Kansas, describing in sufficient detail the measures which will be employed to comply with the regulations contained under Section 15-303. No building permit shall be issued by the City nor shall a final plat be approved by the Planning Commission until such plans has been approve by the City.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

15-303.       Stormwater requirements.

Notwithstanding applicable Federal and State stormwater quality requirements imposed during construction, the following measures shall be applied, relating to post construction stormwater management.

(a)   The quantity of impervious surface shall be minimized as practical for the proposed principal use.

(b)   Best management practices (BMP) shall be employed to minimize off-site stormwater runoff, increase on-site infiltration, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural drainage patterns and minimize off-site discharge of pollutants to surface water. BMP may include measures such as detention and retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping, control terraces, rain gardens and swales, flattening of drainage slopes or other measures having widespread acceptance or endorsed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

(c)   The calculated peak rate of stormwater run-off that would be directed off-site upon full development of a proposed subdivision or after the proposed development of a single tract, shall not exceed the peak rate of stormwater run-off that exists prior to such development. Calculations shall take under consideration any contributing runoff from areas adjacent to or upstream from the site. The peak rate of stormwater runoff shall be determined upon application of the design criteria based upon standard engineering practices by a licensed professional engineer.

(d)   Where on-site measures to reduce the peak runoff rate to pre-development levels are deemed to be impractical, determination of required offsite improvements shall be made by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas, and shall be made at the expense of the developer. The Planning Commission shall review and recommend Governing Body approve of one of the following approaches:

(1)   Offsite measures, including detention on public right-of-way or on property owned by others, where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place, setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such measures and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance.

(2)   Offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by private parties, where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such improvements and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance by the developer.

(3)   Offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by the City or another public agency at no cost to the City, provided that the Governing Body approves such alterations to City owned public facilities, or that any necessary approvals required from other public agencies are secured.

(e)   Where the amount of storage capacity can be increased to provide a benefit to the public, as in cases where a channel draining other properties and streets passes through the subject property, negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

15-304.       Stormwater facilities.

All stormwater conduits, channels, basins, inlets, etc., must be capable of accommodating the calculated peak of stormwater discharge, assuming full development of the upstream catchment basin, as determined by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas. Construction of all such facilities shall be in accordance with City standards and shall be subject to inspection by the City for compliance therewith. Where stormwater facilities can be upsized to create a benefit to the public, negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

15-305.       Construction timing and certification.

The developer shall furnish the City with a certification by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas, that the stormwater control measures are complete, having the required storage capacity, and that all stormwater facilities are fully functional, prior to the development of any land, the runoff from which is to be addressed by the control measure, in the case of a subdivision; or prior to occupancy of a building, in the case of other developments.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

15-306.       Stream protection corridor.

In cases where a defined open drainage course serving an upstream basin or ten (10) or more acres passes beside or through a property proposed to be subdivided or developed, a stream protection corridor shall be provided, wherein no buildings or structures shall be sited, and no soil shall be disturbed, except as needed to furnish utilities, or to meet the above requirements. The purpose of the corridor is to provide for sufficient vegetation to absorb, filter and slow the speed of stormwater entering the drainage course. Removal of trees, shrubs and ground cover in such corridors shall be minimized unless suitably replaced within sixty (60) days of construction. Restoration of vegetation shall be addressed in the developer’s stormwater management plan for the site. The width of the required corridor shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course, defined as the edge of vegetation, where delineated, or the edge of the channel required to accommodate a two year storm, where not delineated. The width of the required corridor from the ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course shall be in accordance with the following table:

(2)   Contact information regarding the party responsible for operation and maintenance

(3)   A schedule for inspection and maintenance

The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirement which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship.

The requirements of this Article were established to consider historical records of average rainfall and engineering and scientific methods. However, larger storms may occur or stormwater run-off heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The provisions of the Article, therefore, shall not be deemed to create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. 1822; Code 2020)

(Ord. 1837A; Code 2020)

15-402        Criteria.

(c)   Water - The installation of more than 500 linear feet of six inch water lines.

(d)   Streets - Traffic count in and out of said development of an average of 15 vehicles per hour.

Nothing herein shall preclude the assessment of such impact fee in the event that the foregoing service requirements are not exceeded if the quality of such services is deemed unusually burdensome.

(Ord. 1837A; Code 2020)

15-403        Amount.

(b)   Services required by such development

The owners of such property shall be given not less than 14 days advance notice of the time and place at which the assessment is to be considered and determined, unless all matters relating to the same are agreed upon by the City and owner of the property to be developed.

(Ord. 1837A; Code 2020)

15-405        Use of funds.

Funds received by the City from the proceeds of the utility impact fee shall be placed in the then existing fund or fund hereafter created relating to the expansion or maintenance of the service for which the assessment was imposed. Such funds shall be used only for the expansion or maintenance of the City service for which the fee has been imposed; provided, however, that at the discretion of the Governing Body, these funds may be used to retire a bond debt resulting from the expansion or maintenance of such City service.

(Ord. 1837A; Code 2020)

15-406        Continuing Obligation.

The Impact Fee shall be payable until such time as the City is satisfied that obligations agreed to when the impact fee was assessed have been met. The Impact Fee shall be an obligation of the owner or owners of the land on which the Fee is based and of any successor person or entity.

(Ord. 1837A; Code 2020)

15-407        Default.

Any Impact Fee not paid within thirty (30) days of its due date shall bear interest at the rate provided for in K.S.A. 16-204 or amendments thereto and any unpaid Impact Fee together with interest shall constitute a lien on the land on which the Impact Fee is based. A description of the land and the Impact Fee together with any interest may be certified to the County Clerk to be collected together with and in the same manner and with the same penalties as if it were an ad valorem tax on the real property. Alternatively, and additionally, any Impact Fee and interest may be collected through a Civil Action including an action to enforce or foreclose on a lien.

Users of such outlets shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 200 cable feet. If additional outlets of Basic Service are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials.

 Page 2
Section 1-3 Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan.
The intent of the Unified Land Development Code is to implement the planning
goals and policies in the Land Use Plan and Development Policies and other
planning documents of the Planning Commission.
Section 1-4 Jurisdiction and Application of Regulations.
A. Jurisdiction. The rules and regulations of the Unified Land Development
Code shall apply to all structures and land within the corporate boundary of
the City of Marysville and the extraterritorial area as defined by ordinance
and adopted by the Governing Body.
B. Application of Regulations.
1. Conformance. No building, structure, lot, tract, parcel or use of the
land shall be used or occupied, erected, constructed, or moved except
in conformity with all the regulations of this ordinance unless a
variance or exception is granted.
2. Bulk and Yard. A building permit shall be issued to an applicant who
is an owner of a legally created "lot of record" (established prior to the
effective date of the ordinance) regardless of bulk or yard
requirements, setbacks or other physical requirements with the
exception that City of Marysville and Marshall County Sanitation Codes
and Flood Plain Regulations, when applicable, shall be followed in
order to obtain a building permit. In establishing bulk, yard or setback
requirements, the Zoning Administrator shall use those requirements in
force at the time the lot was recorded or platted, or as an alternative,
provide an equitable manner of "averaging" requirements based on
neighborhood conditions.
3. Setback Measurement. A front yard setback shall mean the distance
between the edge of the R.O.W. to the base of a structure, and does
not include any part of the structure that projects outward above this
line. The side and rear yard setbacks shall mean the distance from the
lot line to the base of structure, and does not include any part of the
structure that projects outward above this line. The exception to this
rule is when a property line runs to the center of the R.O.W.
4. Building Height. The maximum height shall mean the distance from
the lowest part of the base of a structure to the tallest point of the roof,
and does not include any accessories projecting upward from the roof.
In calculating height design for building or site plan purposes, the
applicant should check with an insurance agent, and the Chief of the
local fire department or district to determine individual limitation.
5. Multiple Buildings on Single Lots. In no case shall there be more
than one main use, building or structure on one lot. An exception is
granted when a single lot is used or zoned for multi-family, commercial
or industrial; however, all such buildings shall collectively comply with
all front, side and rear yard requirements for the zoning district where
the lot is located.
6. Unlawful Acts. It shall be unlawful to erect, move, remodel and/or
increase square footage, or readapt any structure or building without a
valid permit. Any person, contractor, corporation or association who
applies for a building permit after construction begins shall be required
 Page 3
to pay a late fee to the Zoning Administrator in addition to regular
charges as stated in Section 1-7 Violations. For the purpose of
assessing late fees, construction officially starts at the time any footing,
slab, support or foundation is poured or installed. See Article 7
Permits Required for Development.
a. Exemptions. Any building used for a valid agricultural purpose is
exempt from the building permit, as set forth in K.S.A. 12-758.
C. Plats. Land shall not be split, divided into lots or parcels, auctioned, or
conveyed for development purposes except as provided by this ordinance.
It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise convey land for the
purpose of laying out any subdivisions, suburban lots, building lots, tracts
or parcels or any owner of any land to establish any street, alley, park or
other property intended for public use or to offer for development purposes
any land without reference to a valid, recorded plat or approved certificate
of survey. All sales or transfers of land shall be considered for
development purposes unless:
1. The split, division, or transfer of land is for a valid agricultural
purpose.
2. The split or division of land is 40 acres or greater in area.
3. The land is owned or held in trust for the United States Government;
The State of Kansas; Marshall County or its political subdivisions;
City of Marysville; or a public school district.
4. The lot, tract, or parcel has been previously subdivided and is now
proposed to be split into no more than two lots or tracts.
Section 1-5 Relationship to Previous Regulations.
Upon adoption of this Unified Land Development Code, all previous zoning
regulations and subdivision rules shall be without effect and are repealed. Any
uses existing before the effective date of this ordinance shall be governed by
the regulations in force at the time the change, permit, or plat was granted,
unless clearly indicated in these regulations.
Section 1-6 Rules for Interpretation.
A. Minimum Requirements. The provisions of this ordinance (ULDC) are
considered to be minimum requirements.
B. Overlapping Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by any
provision of this ordinance on the use of land, buildings, or structures are
more restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other laws,
ordinances, resolutions, rules or regulations of any kind, the restrictions of
this ordinance shall govern.
C. Private Agreements. The provisions of this ordinance are not intended to
annul or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or private legal
agreement, except that when the regulations of this ordinance are more
restrictive, or impose higher standards than private agreements, the
regulations of this ordinance shall govern.
 Page 4
D. Unlawful Uses. No building, structure, or use of the land that is not
lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, shall become
or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this ordinance.
Section 1-7 Violations.
A. A violation of any regulation adopted in this ordinance shall be a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00 or
by imprisonment for not more than six months for each offense, or by fine
and imprisonment. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate
offense. In addition, the City may institute appropriate action, including
injunction and mandamus, to prevent unlawful erection, construction or
alteration of structures, use of the land, occupation of buildings, abatement
of nuisances, failure to obtain permits, sale of land for development
purposes without reference to a valid plat or refusal to obey and adhere to
a lawful order of the Zoning Administrator.
B. Any person, the value or use of whose land is or may be affected by such
violation, shall have the authority to maintain suits or actions in a court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce these adopted regulations and to abate
nuisances maintained in violation thereof.
C. Whenever any building or structure is erected, constructed, moved, altered
or converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is purposed to
be used in violation of any floodplain regulation contained herein, the
city/and or the Attorney General and the Chief Engineer of the Kansas
Division of Water Resources of the State Board of Agriculture, in addition
to other remedies, may institute injunction, or other appropriate action to
prevent such violations.
D. Any person or agent who applies for a building permit after construction
starts (after any footing, slab, support or foundation is installed) shall be
required to pay a late charge in accord with the following schedule:
New or Relocated
Principal Buildings
Additions to Buildings
or Accessory Buildings
First Offense $150 $75
Second Offense $200 $75
Third Offense $300 $200
Thereafter $400 $400
Additional Late Charges For All Structures.
For All Offenses.
1. An additional $500.00 late charge will be added to the initial fee if a
valid permit is not obtained within 7 working days after a Stop Work
Order is issued by the Zoning Administrator. A stay of this action
shall be granted to the violator if a proper appeal is filed with the
Board of Zoning Appeals or the District Court prior to the 7th
workday period.
2. An additional $200.00 will be added to the accumulated late fee if a
valid permit is not obtained within 14 days after a Stop Work Order is
issued by the Zoning Administrator. A stay of this action shall be
 Page 5
granted to the violator if a proper appeal is filed with the Board of
Zoning Appeals or the District Court prior to the 14th working day
period.
E. The Zoning Administrator and/or the designated deputy, upon finding a
violation of these regulations (or if a proposed action would constitute a
violation), shall have the power to:
1. Issue a Notice of Violation that shall specify the offense, the name
of the property owner or agent and/or occupant, the legal description
of the property, and the remedy. A reasonable and prudent time
shall be set to correct the violation, or to file an appeal.
2. Issue a Stop Work Order which shall command any person to
immediately cease and desist from any unlawful construction, use or
alteration of any building or land.
3. Municipal Court Action. The Zoning Administrator or designated
deputy may issue a Citation and Notice to Appear before the
Municipal Court. The citation shall set forth the named person, the
offense, and the time to appear in municipal court.
F. Whenever a violation of this ordinance occurs or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a complaint with the Zoning Administrator
stating fully the facts or grounds upon which the complaint is based. The
Zoning Administrator shall promptly record and investigate such complaint
and take appropriate action as provided in this ordinance.

4. Notice and Order. See above Section 1-7(E).
5. Permits. The Zoning Administrator may refuse to issue any required
permits on parcels or lots cited for active violations of this ordinance.
Section 1-8 Severability.
The intent of the Governing Body of Marysville is that the provisions of this
ordinance are separable, in accord with the following:
A. If a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges any provision of this ordinance
invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provision of this ordinance.
 Page 6
B. If any court of competent jurisdiction finds invalid the application of any
provisions of this ordinance to a particular parcel of land, building or other
structure, this judgment shall not affect the application of said provisions to
any other parcel of land, building or structure.
Section 1-9 Vesting.
A. Residential Development Rights. The right to construct all residential
units shall vest at the time the final plat is recorded and the first valid
permit is issued. If construction is not commenced on such land within five
(5) years of recording the final plat, such rights shall expire and require
reapproval of the plat.
B. Non-Residential Development Rights. Development rights for all
purposes other than residential use shall vest upon the issuance of all valid
permits required by the City, and, construction has commenced beyond the
foundation or slab installation, and work amounting to $2,500 for materials
is completed.
Section 1-10 Effective Date.
The provisions of this ordinance shall become effective from and after the date
of their approval and adoption by the Governing Body and publication of the
adopting ordinance. All zoning actions taken under prior regulations are
hereby affirmed with zoning district classifications assigned as indicated on the
official zoning map adopted with these regulations.

 Page 17
H. Conformance of the requested change to the adopted or recognized
comprehensive plan, or other planning policies and documents of the City

sanitary and storm sewers, water and electrical service, police and fire
protection, schools, parks and recreation facilities.
J. The extent to which the proposed use will adversely affect the capacity or
safety of the street or road network influenced by the use. Or if the
proposed uses provide adequate access roads or ingress and egress to
prevent traffic hazards.
K. The environmental impacts generated by the proposed use including, but
not limited to, loss of prime farmland, flooding problems, excessive storm
water runoff, soil erosion and sedimentation, adverse effects on water
supplies, including surface and ground waters, air pollution, noise pollution,

the Unified Land Development Code and other applicable ordinances.
Section 3-7 Uses Permitted Upon Review.
A. Purpose and Intent. The intent of these provisions is to recognize that
certain uses may be appropriate only in a specific location. The
determination of whether the proposed use and specific location are
appropriate is achieved through a Planning Commission review. The
purpose of the review is to allow the Planning Commission to evaluate the
compatibility of the proposed use with the character of surrounding
property, adequacy of services and other factors.
B. Restrictions. Property must either be correctly zoned, or first undergo
rezoning, before the request for use permitted upon review can be granted.
A use permitted by review requires a special public hearing that is separate
from an amendment to the zoning map. A change in zoning permits a
range of uses, whereas a use permitted by review authorizes only one
particular use as listed in the zoning district.
C. When Required. A review is required when a use is listed under "Uses
Permitted Upon Review" as contained in each zoning district.
D. Supplemental Regulations. Uses authorized under a review shall comply
with all applicable supplementary use regulations specified in Article 18.

particular location, conditions may be imposed in the approval of a use
permitted by review. The Planning Commission is authorized to stipulate
such conditions and restrictions as deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the criteria for review
contained in Section 3-9.

compliance with conditions shall be required. See Appendix for a
development agreement.
Section 3-8 Procedures for Uses Permitted Upon Review.
A. Application. A written application for a special review shall be filed with
the Zoning Administrator. This shall include a statement indicating the
section of the authorizing section of the ordinance and sufficient evidence

application not submitted with a fee shall be determined as incomplete and
returned to the applicant.
C. Site Plan. All applicants for a review shall submit with their application a
site plan in accordance with the submission requirements of Section 5-2,
Article 5. The Planning Commission is authorized to waive the site plan
requirement when one is deemed unnecessary.
D. Hearing. Upon receipt of the formal application and all accompanying
material, the Zoning Administrator shall call a public hearing. A notice must
be published in the official city newspaper at least 20 days prior to the date
set for the hearing.

adjacent sites and uses of property, and the nature and intensity of
operations proposed.

Section 4-1 General Provisions
Section 4-2 Certificate of Non-Conformity
Section 4-1 General Provisions.
A. Vested Property Right. A previously legal conforming use is a vested
property right that runs with the land. Therefore, the use cannot be lost
from a sale or transfer of the property. The non-conforming use
designation arises from a use of the land that is lawful but, due to a change
in regulations, no longer "conforms" to current ordinance provisions.
B. Authority to Continue. Any structure, building or use of the land lawfully
existing before the effective date of the adoption of this ordinance shall be
allowed to continue unchanged.
C. Damage or Destruction. A previously legal structure or building that is
damaged by fire, flood, wind or other disaster to the extent of 50 percent of
the assessed value of the building, shall be reconstructed in a manner that
is more conforming to the provisions of these regulations. The Board of

the zoning map may be necessary, and a waiting period
of from 30 to 90 days may be required to process the
required amendments.
Step Three: The Zoning Administrator will review pertinent
requirements for platting, including roads, easements,
physical arrangement and density, and general
regulations for public water and sewer connections.
When necessary, the Zoning Administrator will give
specific instructions for the initial design of facilities.
Step Four: The applicant shall review all environmental and sanitary
regulations and flood plain elevation maps that are
currently in force in Marysville/Marshall County.
Step Five: The applicant should seek a Licensed Land Surveyor to
begin the initial phase of subdivision. Please note that
only a Licensed Land Surveyor {Kansas} may issue the
actual Certificate of Survey.
Section 5-7 The Lot Split.
A. Purpose and Intent. The lot split is intended to allow owners of a lot of
record within a recorded subdivision inside the city limits to divide such lot,
tract or parcel into no more than two lots, tracts or parcels without recourse
to replatting. The lot split may also be used to remove or alter lot lines on

Section 5-11 Procedure for Preliminary Plat.
A. Review for Plat Sufficiency. As an agenda item, but prior to the
scheduled public hearing, the Planning Commission first reviews a
preliminary plat to determine if sufficient information has been assembled
by the applicant to hold the public hearing. If a majority of the Planning
Commissioners vote for sufficiency, then a public hearing shall be
conducted. A preliminary plat deemed insufficient may be reviewed again
at a subsequent hearing, but if again found insufficient, it must be retained
by the developer for at least 90 days following the last scheduled hearing
before it can be resubmitted.
B. Public Notice. Notice of the public hearing is given in the Official City
Newspaper at least twenty (20) days in advance of the hearing. Notice by
regular mail is given to all adjoining property owners. If the subject
property is located within a subdivision, then notice is given to all owners of
record within the subdivision (or subdivision phase/unit).
C. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission, after the public hearing is
closed, shall review the preliminary plat in accordance with the guidelines
and criteria set forth in this Unified Land Development Code.
 Page 29
1. Additional Criteria for Review. The Planning Commission may
also review the plat, using reasonable criteria, to assure proper
land use plan conformance, and environmental and agricultural
land impact, service requirements and financial assurance.
Cooperating utility companies, such as telephone, gas, and
electric, shall validate the review by returning their certificate of
review within a time specified by the Zoning Administrator.
2. Code Conformance. If the preliminary plat is found to conform in all
respects to the Unified Land Development Code and other City
requirements, the Planning Commission shall approve (by majority
vote) and sign the plat.
3. Code Non-Conformance. If the preliminary plat does not conform
in all respects with the Unified Land Development Code, at the
scheduled review the Planning Commission shall either vote to
disapprove the plat, or grant the applicant a period of 60 days to
correct the plat deficiencies. If the developer does not return a plat
for approval within the 60-day time period, the preliminary shall be
considered null and void.
4. Corrected Plat. When a corrected preliminary plat is returned by
the applicant for review, the Planning Commission shall vote to
accept or deny the plat. If denied, the applicant who continues to
pursue approval shall reapply for a first hearing - including a
scheduled public hearing.
D. Modifications and Conditions. The Planning Commission is authorized
to require the modification of a preliminary plat to conform to the Unified
Land Development Code, or to modify or add conditions to any plat when
such action increases the public convenience, conform to the goals of the
comprehensive plan, supports property values, or secures the public
health, safety and welfare.
E. Variances. The Planning Commission is granted authority to vary
setbacks and yard sizes to overcome practical difficulties, or to promote
efficient land design, or to approve zero lot line or cluster techniques.
F. Easements. The Planning Commission is authorized to compel applicants
to file easements that are necessary to serve the future residents of a
subdivision, protect the use and value of neighboring property and to
promote the public safety and welfare; the authority to compel applicants to
offer for dedication or reservation such property as necessary to safely,
conveniently and effectively serve the general welfare, promote good
standards of land design and land use, and to advance the practice of
agricultural {and other natural resources} preservation.
Section 5-12 General Design Standards for Preliminary Plats.
A. Purpose and Intent. The intent of this section is to inform the
engineer/designer of a preliminary plat of the general design standards to
be used when laying out the plat. These general design standards identify
initial design considerations. The complete design standards for final plats
are found in Article 6 Design Standards for Site Plans and Subdivisions.
B. Right-of-Way. R.O.W.'s shall be a minimum of 60' feet wide, and greater
widths may be required by the Planning Commission after preliminary
 Page 30
review; utility easements must be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet wide or, 8
feet for appurtenant utility easements on interior lots. If the proposed
subdivision is located in a sewer benefit district (or if it will be annexed in
the near future), a minimum 20' utility easement is required. Street lighting,
sidewalks, and fire hydrants shall be indicated in areas planned for
residential use. Cul-de-sacs are not limited in length, but Fire District fill
points, if available, shall be installed every 500 feet.
C. Ingress/Egress. For new developments attached, or nearly contiguous to
the City of Marysville, existing street patterns should be followed. Each
rural subdivision shall have no more than two means of common entrance
or exit unless waived by the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission prefers the rural subdivider to provide a single road to each
subdivision, and to provide internal and/or frontage distribution roads. The
Planning Commission may limit or increase the number of means of
ingress/egress, for the purpose of traffic safety.
D. Road Plans. Road plans are required and shall include a general
schedule with instructions and specifications. See Section 6.2 (K).
E. Utility Service. If the development is to be served with public water or
sewer, the plat shall bear a notation that the subdivision is to be served by
these facilities. The Zoning Administrator may not issue a building permit
for a lot noted "SERVICED BY PUBLIC WATER/SEWER" without written
verification from the public water or sewer district that all distribution or
collection lines have been installed and that all lots are either connected or
are capable of being connected to central utilities. Lots less than five (5)
acres in size shall be connected to the water distribution system, with
meter installed or application for meter verified prior to the issuance of a
building permit. Lots greater than five (5) acres shall provide verification
that the water distribution system is installed and ready for service in the
future.
F. Sanitary Waste Feasibility Study. If requested by the Planning
Commission, the preliminary plat shall be accompanied by a feasibility
study if central sewer and water will not serve the development. The
feasibility study shall indicate quality and gallons/minute of water available
for individual wells, and general suitability of the soil for laterals or lagoons.
G. Unplanned Parcels Prohibited. All portions of the tract being subdivided
shall be taken up in lots {or phases}, streets, planned open areas or other
uses so that remnants and landlocked areas are not created.
Section 5-13 Final Plat Requirements.

land development with the Register of Deeds. To be approved, the final
plat shall comply with all data submitted on the preliminary plat, and all
changes or conditions imposed by the Planning Commission at the initial
hearing. Once the preliminary plat is approved by the Planning
Commission, no changes may be required on the final plat except for
honest error or the discovery of erroneous data that would impact upon the
public health, safety, or welfare.
B. Size and Quality. The final plat shall be produced on 24 inch high by 36-

Section 5-14 Procedure for Final Plats.
A. Review. If the Planning Commission approves a preliminary plat, the
applicant may submit a final plat to the Planning Commission for review of
compliance.
1. Planning Commission Action. The question of final approval will
be placed upon a consent agenda at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission. Unless the Commission
moves to amend the agenda and require an examination for
conformance, the final plat shall be considered to be approved.
Alternatively, a majority of the Planning Commission may authorize
the Planning Commission Chair and Secretary to sign all final plats
at a time and place designated by the motion.
2. Governing Body Action. After the Planning Commission approves
the final plat, the appropriate Governing Body shall examine the
plat to ensure conformance with all city/county/township road
standards, offers of dedication, and financial assurances. Within
30 days the appropriate Governing Body must either resolve to
accept the plat, require modifications to conform to development
standards and polices, return the plat to the Planning Commission
for modification, or refuse its acceptance. If returned to the
Planning Commission or refused, the reasons shall be set forth in
writing.
3. Affect of Denial for Public Acceptance. If a final plat is refused
because of failure to adhere to road standards, or if offers of
dedication would be contrary to public policy, or if financial
assurances are insufficient, the matter has reached closure, and
the plat may not be filed.
4. Signatures Required. After all appropriate Governing Bodies sign
the final plat, the applicant has 120 days to secure all staff
signatures (which denote "complies with all requirements"), a
certificate of title, proof of financial assurance, and file the
instrument with the City Clerk and or Register of Deeds.
 Page 33
Otherwise, the plat shall be considered void and expired and the
process of approval must start again.
B. Public Notice and Hearing. No public notice or public hearing is required
for a final plat.
C. Modifications and Conditions. The Planning Commission is authorized
to require the modification of a final plat to conform to the Unified Land
Development Code, or to modify or add conditions to any plat when such
action increases the public convenience, conform to the goals of the
comprehensive plan, supports property values, or secures the public
health, safety and welfare.
Section 5-15 Conflicting Requirements.
A. Standards. Standards {such as setbacks} appearing on a plat which are
greater than those imposed by this ordinance are valid, and shall be duly
noted and enforced by building permits.
B. Restrictive Covenants. Restrictive covenants are private instruments
between the buyer and seller. The Marysville Planning Commission does
not enforce restrictive covenants unless such restrictions are part of a
Planned Unit Development or Special Development Overlay District, or
unless the City itself, as a condition of platting, is a party to such
agreements.
Section 5-16 Instruments of Financial Assurance.
A. Installation of Infrastructure. New development or additions to existing
development is required to install infrastructure (which includes roads,
drainage courses, culverts, potable water distribution or sewer collection)
and other services to all lots as they appear on the final plat prior to
receiving a building permit from the Zoning Administrator.
B. Financial Assurances. Prior to the filing of the final plat, all required
infrastructure must be assured by a financial instrument (letter of credit,
bond, or special benefit district). Financial assurances must be made in a
form and amount acceptable and approved by the City Clerk. Unless
otherwise indicated by special resolution of the appropriate Governing
Body, financial assurances shall equal one hundred and fifty (150) percent
of the estimated cost of purchase and installation and valid for a period of
one year. If substantial progress in installing the infrastructure is not
evident within 280 days after filing the final plat, the city or county shall take
appropriate action to exercise the financial assurance.
C. Exceptions. The Zoning Administrator may issue building permits to lots
in new residential developments that have direct access to existing public
roads, water, and/or sewer upon verification by the Zoning Administrator
that building construction will not interfere with the installation of new
infrastructure.
 Page 34
Section 5-17 Dedication of Rights-of-Way.
A. Subdividers, if requested by the Planning Commission, are required to
dedicate right-of-way land as public streets that abut the proposed
development in accordance with the following schedule.
1. One half (1/2) the distance necessary to make the total right-of-way 60'
on the abutting side of the development.
a. If the public road is a 50' right-of-way, the subdivider shall dedicate 5'
to the responsible Governing Body. [Baseline 60'- 50'/2 = 5' required
dedication].
b. If the public road is a 40' right-of-way, the subdivider shall dedicate
10' to the responsible Governing Body. [Baseline 60'- 40'/2 = 10'
required dedication].
c. If the development lies on both sides of the right-of-way, and the
public road is less than 60' feet, the subdivider shall dedicate all
property necessary to make the road a full 60' right-of-way.
Note: The standards used by the Marysville Planning Commission in a general
review of plats, site plans, and general sketches are normal and customary. As
with all standards, they do not take into account specific conditions that are
unique to certain areas of the City.
Engineers, architects and surveyors should be guided in their design practice by
a trade or technical publication such as The Architectural Standards,
Fundamentals of Site Design, or Planning Design Criteria. The City Clerk is
empowered to substitute equivalent standards {not contained in this ordinance}
when it can be demonstrated by reference that an alternate standard will provide
a safe and sufficient design solution.
Section-5-18 Responsibility For Dedications.
A. Unless otherwise amended by an official road plan of the City of Marysville,
or a joint agreement between the City of Marysville and the Marshall
County Commissioners, the following procedure for accepting public
dedication on final plats shall govern.
1. All offers of public dedication within the municipal limits of the City of
Marysville shall be the responsibility of the Marysville City Council.
2. All offers of public dedication in the extraterritorial zone and
subdivision area on a designated county road shall be the
responsibility of the Marshall County Commission.
B. The certificate of the appropriate Governing Body signifying the
acceptance of all offers to dedicate to the public shall appear on all plats.
The certificate of the Marysville City Council shall appear on all plats, both
within municipal boundaries and in the extraterritorial zone, indicating that
the City Council has reviewed all specifications, offers of assurance, and
standards in the event of future annexation.
 Page 35
Section 5-19 Concurrent Preliminary and Final Plat Review.
The Zoning Administrator is authorized to decide if a preliminary plat and final
plat can be filed and placed on the Planning Commission agenda for
concurrent approval.
Section 5-20 Vesting of Final Plats.
For residential developments (subdivisions with a final plat), development
rights in such land use shall vest upon recording of the plat. If construction is
not commenced on such land within five (5) years of recording the final plat, the
development rights shall expire.
Section 5-21 Resubdivision (Replat) or Revision of Plats.
A. Replatting. Any previously subdivided tract(s) may be resubdivided after
submission of a new or corrected plat. Resubdivided plats may be used
for the following purposes:
1. The division of any existing lot into two or more additional lots.
2. The correction of any monument, distances, and/or bearing.
3. The addition or removal of any easement or the removal of any lot line.
4. The vacation of a lot(s) from an existing subdivision.
5. The renaming of an existing plat.
B. Title Block. All resubdivision plats shall contain the title RESUBDIVSION
or REPLAT followed by the original title of the plat and, if applicable, the
lot(s) that are to be divided: i.e., "A Replat of Lots 1 and 2 of Brallage
Subdivision".
C. Renumbering of Existing Lots Using Resubdivision. When one or
more lots are created from an existing numbered (or lettered) lot(s), the
new lot(s) shall be numbered as follows:
1. Abandoning lot lines between two or more lots to create one or
more lots: the lowest lot number plus the letter beginning with (A).
Example - abandoning lot lines between lots 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 to
create a new, single lot; the lot is now numbered 1A. If the lot
originally contained a letter designation, then the new lot shall
contain the lowest letter plus the numeric character one (1).
2. Creating two or more new lots from an existing lot: the letters A,
B … and so forth for each new lot created preceded by the original
lot number. Example: lot 4 is split into four (4) lots - the new lots
would be lots 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D.
3. Adding new lots (one or more) to an existing subdivision: as far
as practicable, the lots shall continue in a consecutive fashion - or by
direction of the Zoning Administrator.
4. Creating new lots from a lot or lots previously resubdivided: as
far as practicable, the lots shall continue using a numbered system.
Example: lot 4 was resubdivided into lots 4A, 4B and 4C. If lot 4A
were resubdivided into three lots, the new numbers would be lot 4A-
1, lot 4A-2, and lot 4A-3.

Section 6-1 General Provisions.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Article is to provide minimum
design standards for site plans and subdivisions for the City of Marysville
and the area of extra-territorial jurisdiction. These regulations set forth
uniform standards for efficient land planning, the installation of
infrastructure, and the creation of new development areas.
B. Variances. The Planning Commission is authorized to vary engineering
design standards when unusual circumstances so warrant.
Section 6-2 Streets, Access Drives and Driveways.
A. General Design and Layout Criteria.
1. Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in
new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the
principal existing streets in adjoining subdivisions (or their proper
projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) where required
by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Alleys and street
arrangements must also be such as to cause no hardships to owners
of adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide
convenient access to it.
2. Half-Width Streets. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half
street or alley adjacent to the tract subdivided, the other half the street
or alley shall be platted and dedicated as a public way. New half of
partial streets shall not be permitted.
3. Street Provisions for Future Development. Where appropriate,
areas shall be reserved for future street usage in conjunction with the
development of adjacent tracts. Areas reserved for future street usage
will not be required to be improved; however, these areas shall be
reserved for street improvements to be provided by the subdivider of
the adjacent tract.
4. Lot Access. The Planning Commission may disapprove any point of
ingress or egress to any lot, tract, or development from any street or
highway when the proposed ingress or egress would create unsafe
conditions, reduce the capacity of the adjoining street or highway, or
result in substandard circulation and impaired vehicle movement.
5. Private Streets. Private streets are discouraged unless such streets
meet the design standards of these regulations for either local or
suburban residential streets. All subdivision streets shall be dedicated
to the public unless design objectives of the development warrant
 Page 37
private ownership. Approval of a subdivision involving a private street
shall be solely at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
6. Streets Adjacent to Railroad Right-of-way, Limited-Access
Highway, Principal Highway. Where lots front or side on the above,
a marginal access street or frontage road may be required which
parallels and is adjacent to such right-of-way. The centerline distance
of the marginal access or frontage road from said right-of-way shall be
based upon requirements for approach connections to existing or
future grade separations.
7. Driveway Entrances. All driveway entrances shall be maintained at a
safe distance from all public road intersections; driveway entrances
shall have a minimum sight distance based on roadway design speed.
8. Street Maintenance. The appropriate Governing Body (i.e., City of
Marysville, Marshall County or Township Board) shall become the
owner and maintain all roadways and appurtenances following, proper
dedication, inspection and approval by the appropriate public engineer.
B. Cul-de-Sacs.
1. Cul-de-sacs shall be permitted when a through road is determined to
be unacceptable due to topography, drainage constraints, or economic
reasons.
2. Cul-de-sacs shall have a closed end, a turnaround with a right-of-way
having a minimum outside radius of not less than 60 feet an shall be
surfaced to a radius of not less that 48 feet; drainage of a cul-de-sac
shall preferably be towards the open end.
C. Street Right-of-Way and Improvement Width.
1. All roads and streets established after the effective date of this
ordinance shall meet the standards in Table1 Street Classification
Summary.
2. When existing or anticipated traffic on arterial and collector streets
warrant greater width of rights-of-way, the additional right-of-way shall
be provided.

gravel.
c. All regular parking spaces on hard surfaces shall be delineated
using painted lines or pre-cast concrete parking blocks.
d. The minimum dimension for all regular parking spaces shall be
10' - 12' in width and 18' to 20' in depth, depending on site plan
design.
2. Disability Parking Spaces.
a. All disability parking spaces shall be on a prepared surface of
concrete or asphalt.
b. All disability parking spaces on hard surfaces shall be
delineated using painted lines. Each space shall be clearly
marked using a disability sign and, if requested, a symbol

distribution of materials or merchandise by motor vehicle or rail. All loading
and unloading operations shall be so located to avoid undue interference
with traffic and public use of streets, alleys and walkways.
Section 6-4 Public Water and Sewer Connections.
A. Installation Requirements.
1. Installation of and connection to a central water system is required
when a proposed {platted} residential subdivision of land is located in
the City of Marysville or within a public water district service area
(RWD). The "service area of a public water district" is defined as a
distance no greater than one half (1/2) of one mile from the nearest
connection point. An exemption from this distance requirement will be
permitted when the public water district issues a "Certificate of Inability
to Serve."
2. Before a building permit can be issued for any principal structure, the
subdivider shall install the water system so that an adequate supply of
potable water is available to every lot in the development. If the
principal structure is located on a lot less than 5 acres, the water meter
shall be in place at the dwelling unit connected to the water supply
before the structure is occupied. If the principal structure is located on
a lot of 5 acres or more, direct connection to the water system is not
required as long as the distribution system is available and accessible
to the lot owner(s). Private wells may be used on lots of 5 acres or
more, but shall be disconnected from the principal structure when
connecting to a public water supply.
3. Written verification shall be required by the public water service district
before a building permit can be issued for a principal structure in a
residential subdivision. The verification shall be worded to assure the
Zoning Administrator that all lines are in place to serve present and
future structures. Written verification by the public water service district
shall also be required for the principal structure on a lot less than 5
acres in size. The verification shall assure the Zoning Administrator
that the principal structure has applied for a water service meter and
that the public water supply will be connected upon completion of
construction.
4. When a proposed subdivision is located in a public sewer district, or if
annexation to the sewer district is contemplated, the subdivider shall
provide connection to the nearest interceptor or main, create utility
easements which touch upon all lots, and install the collection system
in all approved phases [final plats] so that connection points touch
 Page 44
upon each lot. No building permits shall be issued until the collection
system is completed and approved.
B. Letters of Credit and Assurances.
1. Before the final plat can be filed for any residential subdivision, the
developer/owner shall arrange for an assurance in the form of a benefit
district or letter of credit to guarantee the installation of the distribution
system. The assurance shall equal one hundred and fifty percent of
the cost estimate supplied by the public water district or a qualified
engineer. The Marysville City Council shall approve all assurances for
water and sewer distribution/collection systems.
Section 6-5 General Design of Lots and Typical Layouts.
A. Lot Access. Residential lots shall front on a public right-of-way. The
Planning Commission may grant a waiver from this requirement and allow
permanent travel easements when appropriate.
B. Corner Lots. Corner {REVERSE} lots shall have equal setbacks unless
waived by the Planning Commission.
C. Easements. As a general rule, utility easements shall be placed on all
sides of a lot unless waived by the Zoning Administrator.
1. Utility easements 8' (companion) in width, or 10' (companion) if sewer
connections are required or anticipated.
2. Drainage and watercourse easements are required. Building setbacks
from watercourses should be measured from the thread of the stream
D. Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to street
lines.
E. General Lot Design. Lot design, before it is approved, shall demonstrate
an informed sensitivity for landform, efficiency, environmental and natural
resource preservation, and public safety.
Section 6-6 Blocks and Lots.
A. Minimum width shall be as required by the Zoning Regulations. Said width
shall be measured at the building setback line, except for irregular shaped
lots.
B. Minimum depth shall be as required by the Zoning Regulations. Said
measurement shall be measured through the center of the lot and shall be
perpendicular to the property line or radial to the property line on curved
streets.
C. Minimum area shall be subject to the Zoning Regulations in which the
subdivision is located.
D. Corner lots shall have such addition of width to observe the same frontage
setback on both streets.
E. Double frontage lots shall be avoided unless, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, a variation to this rule will give better street alignment and lot
arrangement and promote a better traffic condition.
 Page 45
F. Every lot shall abut on a public street or travel easement.
G. Building setback lines shall be shown on the final plat for all lots in the
subdivision and shall not be less than the setback required by the Zoning
Regulations and/or ordinance adopted by the City.
H. The subdivision or resubdivision of a tract or lot shall not be permitted
where said subdivision or resubdivision places an existing permanent
structure in violation of the requirements of the Zoning Regulations.
I. No provision of these regulations shall be construed as to require a replat
for the split of any lot into two tracts if it is zoned residential. Should a tract
be zoned industrial, it may be divided into any number of tracts without a
replat.
J. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with
City codes and in providing legal access to lots from an approved public
street.
Section 6-7 Survey Monuments and Markers.
A. Locations.
1. The Registered Land Surveyor shall set a permanent monument at
each and every controlling corner on the boundary of the parcel or tract
being subdivided. Monuments shall be placed at intervals of 900 feet
on straight lines.
2. Permanent monuments shall be set at all lot and block corners.
3. In cases where the placement of a monument at its proper location is
impractical, it shall be permissible to set reference monuments close to
that point. If such reference monument is set, its location shall be
properly shown on the plat. When conditions warrant setting a
monument on an offset, the location shall be selected so that the
monument lies on a line of the survey or on the prolongation of such
line. Offsets shall be set at even foot intervals from the true location.
B. Character, Type, Position Noted on the Plat, and Approval.
1. The character, type and position shall be noted on the plat, all
distances must be expressed to the nearest hundredth of a foot.
2. Permanent monuments shall be of material capable of being detected
by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
a) The monument size shall be a solid steel rod of not less than

Section 13-1 General Provisions.
A. Purpose and Intent. This district provides a restricted and limited use
overlay device to allow flexible review procedures and mixed-use
development in municipal and extraterritorial areas designated by the
Planning Commission. Special and mixed use development is encouraged
as an infill technique on underused tracts or lots, on properties that have
remained unused because of physical conditions or constraints, and in
areas of potential conflicts that require special planning and review
procedures to protect nearby areas.
B. Operation. The SDOD is an overlay device that requires specific
application, review, and special conditions imposed by the Planning
Commission. A case-by-case examination of site conditions, nearby uses,
and potential conflicts is necessary before the overlay district can be used
to permit new development. This district is not intended to grant special
benefits to property owners who otherwise cannot achieve development
permission because of detrimental impacts on the use, value, and
enjoyment of nearby property. Rather, the proper use of this district
recognizes the historic mixed character of neighborhood development in
Marysville and the under use of certain areas where new development will
be beneficial. Implementation of the SDOD does not change the underlying
zoning district.
C. Where Allowed. The following districts are eligible to receive the overlay
district:

and intensity to the surrounding neighborhood and are capable of
containing their day-to-day operations (noise, odor, light, and sound)
within their lot lines.
3. Transitional commercial/fabrication uses that contain either
retail/service and light fabrication or product assembly in an enclosed
 Page 88
building. Such uses must be capable of providing suitable parking
facilities on-site or in specially prepared areas so as not to create a
nuisance in areas used for residential or retail commercial purposes.
4. Any use that employs storage as the principal activity.
5. Product component assembly or refurbishment uses that do not
employ machinery line assembly, welding, metal stamping or forging.
6. Bottling and microbrewery.

Section 14-5 Use Restriction.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this section in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots
using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike
hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing,
take-off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
Section 14-6 Non-Conforming Uses.
A. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this section
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to regulations as of the
effective date of this ordinance, or -otherwise interfere with the continuance
of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any charge
in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted.
B. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the
City Council to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights
shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of
Marysville.
Section 14-7 Permits.
A. Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in a., b., and c. hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be
erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to
the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative,
the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the
provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been
approved in accordance with Section F, 4.
1. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such
" tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for
such zones.
2. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the
runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
 Page 96
seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
3. In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the
perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any
tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of
terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above
the height limit -prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or
alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of
the height limits established by this ordinance, except as set forth in
Section D, 8.
B. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit a nonconforming
use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it
was on the effective date of this section or any amendments thereto or
than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the City
Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree
to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations.
D. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to
the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from such regulations. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not
create a hazard to air navigation, and will be in accordance with the spirit
of this ordinance.
E. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require
the owner of the structure or tree in question to install operate, and
maintain, at the owner's expense, such marking and lights as may be
necessary. If deemed property by the Board of Appeals, this condition may
be modified to require the owner to permit the City of Marysville, at its own
expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and
lights.
E. Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the City Administrator to administer
and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and
variances shall be made to the City Clerk upon a form published for that

The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-766 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare.
Therefore, the governing body of the City of Marysville, Kansas, ordains the
following regulations.
Section 16-2 Findings of Fact.
A. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Marysville, Kansas, are
subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by (1) cumulative effect of development in
any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages.
 Page 104
C. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a
standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of
a series of interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations
which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of
inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of
large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this article. It is the general order
of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of
occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance
Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated December 1, 1977,
as amended, and any future revisions thereto;
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and
overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood;
3. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of the floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the
regulatory flood.
Section 16-3 Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 16-1 by provisions
designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses, which are dangerous to health, safety or property
in times of flood or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities, which
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction.
C. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazards.
D. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to
purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Section 16-4 Lands to Which Article Applies.
This article shall apply to all lands within the Jurisdiction of the City of
Marysville, Kansas, identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as
Zone Al6 and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in Section 16-
16 of this article. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be
permitted except upon a development permit granted by the governing body or
its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as
the governing body or the designated representative may reasonably impose
 Page 105
for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the
inhabitants of the City and where specifically noted in Sections 16-18:30.
Section 16-5 Enforcement Officer.
The City Inspector and/or the Zoning Administrator are hereby designated as
the governing body's duly designated enforcement officers under this article.
Section 16-6 Boundaries For Interpretation of District Boundaries.
The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be
determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the
exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning
map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions, the enforcement officer shall make the
necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested,
the Board of Zoning Appeals will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood
elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the
district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her case to the
Board and to submit his/her own technical evidence, if he/she so desires.
Section 16-7 Compliance.
No development located within known flood hazard areas of this community
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
Section 16-8 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the

Section 16-9 Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held
to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the
governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by state statutes.
Section 16-10 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes such as ice jams and height bridge
openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside
floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within
such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Marysville or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the items listed below have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical jurisdiction required
for issuing the variance increases.
 Page 117
A. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration
of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State
Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon
determination.
B. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief
D. Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and sufficient
cause; (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (3) a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
E. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a
community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.000 of insurance
coverage; and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the

benefit.
2. In order for the BZA to grant a variance the board must specifically find for
the record that:
a. The variance arises from a condition unique to the property in
question, and is not a general condition found in the neighborhood.
b. That granting the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners or residents.
c. That strict adherence to the regulations in the specific case will
constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner requesting
the variance. The board must determine that the hardship is greater
than economic disadvantage, and in fact extends to a means of
livelihood, a matter of protecting title to property, or if left
uncorrected, would result in a severe and irrevocable change in the
applicant's ability to transfer property. A hardship may also be
construed to be "honest error" imposed upon a property owner by a
ministerial official, or licensed professional, or through eminent
domain or zoning resulting in a substantial {a near taking} loss of
property rights.
d. The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health,
safety, morals or welfare, convenience, prosperity or general order.
D. Exceptions. The BZA may grant exceptions to the provisions of this Unified
Development Ordinance in those instances where the Board is specifically
 Page 152
authorized to act, and only under such terms and conditions that are
enumerated in the regulations.
Section 1-9 Representatives and Agents.

ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting the right of any applicant or a
member of a public hearing to retain an agent to represent them before the
Planning Commission or BZA. Likewise, legal counsel may be used to
represent any person having business pertaining to this ordinance. All
persons, and their agents or counsels, have a right to speak at the
designated time, submit written comments for the record, make objections,
note exceptions, or request points of clarification {for the record} during
public hearings.

Ord. No. 1822 - Stormwater Regulations
(First Published in the Marysville Advocate, Official City Paper, Thursday, August 14, 2014.)
ORDINANCE NO. 1822
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER XV,
OF THE MARYSVILLE CITY CODE TO INCORPORATE STORMWATER REGULATIONS
Article 3. Storm Water Regulations
15 - 301 PURPOSE AND INTENT OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
In order to reduce property damage, minimize siltation and soil erosion, and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding, and in order to provide for basic protections to the quality of water in the various streams, drainage channels, ponds and reservoirs in the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Marysville, these regulations set forth below shall hereinafter be applicable to all the following instances, except as noted.
1. Subdivision of land, where the total platted area exceeds two (2) acres, and/or where the total impermeable surface area upon full development, including streets, parking lots, buildings, drives and sidewalks is estimated to exceed one half (1/2) acre; development for multiple-family dwellings; development for more than two (2) dwelling units on a lot or adjoining lots; development of all residential districts allowed under Article 10 of the Uniform Land Development Code; and commercial, industrial or other types of non-residential development having a total site impermeable surface area of more than one half (1/2) acre, including, but not limited to such features as roofs, driveways and sidewalks.
2. Such regulations shall not apply to:
a. Construction of any building or future improvements on a site, which have been previously provided with approved stormwater management control facilities as a part of a larger unit of development.
b. Remodeling, repair, replacement and improvements to any existing structure or facility that does not cause an increase in the impermeable surface area by more than one half (1/2) acre.
c. Development where it can be demonstrated by a study, conducted by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas, that the detention of stormwater runoff or other measures referenced herein would be detrimental to the drainage basin or would provide no benefit to development downstream. Only such specified measure(s) shall be rendered inapplicable to the subject development.
d. Development in the C-1 and C-2 districts.
15 - 302 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
Developers shall submit, along with the preliminary plat, or plans for development of a site or building, a storm water management plan, prepared by an engineer duly licensed by the State of Kansas, describing in sufficient detail the measures which will be employed to comply with the regulations contained under Section 15-303 of this Article. No building permit shall be issued by the City nor shall a final plat be approved by the Planning Commission until such plans has been approve by the City.
Ord. No. 1822 - Stormwater Regulations
15 - 303 STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS
Notwithstanding applicable Federal and State stormwater quality requirements imposed during construction, the following measures shall be applied, relating to post construction stormwater management.
1. The quantity of impervious surface shall be minimized as practical for the proposed principal use.
2. Best management practices (BMP) shall be employed to minimize off-site stormwater runoff, increase on-site infiltration, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural drainage patterns and minimize off-site discharge of pollutants to surface water. BMP may include measures such as detention and retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping, control terraces, rain gardens and swales, flattening of drainage slopes or other measures having widespread acceptance or endorsed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
3. The calculated peak rate of stormwater run-off that would be directed off-site upon full development of a proposed subdivision or after the proposed development of a single tract, shall not exceed the peak rate of stormwater run-off that exists prior to such development. Calculations shall take under consideration any contributing runoff from areas adjacent to or upstream from the site. The peak rate of stormwater runoff shall be determined upon application of the design criteria based upon standard engineering practices by a licensed professional engineer.
4. Where on-site measures to reduce the peak runoff rate to pre-development levels are deemed to be impractical, determination of required offsite improvements shall be made by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas, and shall be made at the expense of the developer. The Planning Commission shall review and recommend Governing Body approve of one of the following approaches:
a. Offsite measures, including detention on public right-of-way or on property owned by others, where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place, setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such measures and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance.
b. Offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by private parties, where suitable approvals and agreements running with the land are in place setting forth financial responsibilities for the construction of such improvements, and setting forth the party responsible for their continued maintenance by the developer.
c. Offsite improvements to stormwater facilities and channels owned by the City or another public agency at no cost to the City, provided that the Governing Body approves such alterations to City owned public facilities, or that any necessary approvals required from other public agencies are secured.
5. Where the amount of storage capacity can be increased to provide a benefit to the public, as in cases where a channel draining other properties and streets passes through the subject property, negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible.
15 - 304 STORMWATER FACILITIES
All stormwater conduits, channels, basins, inlets, etc., must be capable of accommodating the calculated peak of stormwater discharge, assuming full development of the upstream catchment basin, as determined by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of Kansas. Construction of all such facilities shall be in accordance with City standards and shall be subject to inspection by the City for compliance therewith.
Ord. No. 1822 - Stormwater Regulations
Where stormwater facilities can be upsized to create a benefit to the public, negotiations for public
participation in the cost of development may be feasible.
15 - 305 CONSTRUCTION TIMING AND CERTIFICATION
The developer shall furnish the City with a certification by an engineer, duly licensed by the State of
Kansas, that the stormwater control measures are complete, having the required storage capacity, and that
all stormwater facilities are fully functional, prior to the development of any land, the runoff from which
is to be addressed by the control measure, in the case of a subdivision; or prior to occupancy of a building,
in the case of other developments.
15 - 306 STREAM PROTECTION CORRIDOR
In cases where a defined open drainage course serving an upstream basin or ten (10) or more acres passes
beside or through a property proposed to be subdivided or developed, a stream protection corridor shall be
provided, wherein no buildings or structures shall be sited, and no soil shall be disturbed, except as
needed to furnish utilities, or to meet the above requirements. The purpose of the corridor is to provide
for sufficient vegetation to absorb, filter and slow the speed of stormwater entering the drainage course.
Removal of trees, shrubs and ground cover in such corridors shall be minimized unless suitably replaced
within sixty (60) days of construction. Restoration of vegetation shall be addressed in the developer’s
stormwater management plan for the site. The width of the required corridor shall be measured from the
ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course, defined as the edge of vegetation, where
delineated, or the edge of the channel required to accommodate a two year storm, where not delineated.
The width of the required corridor from the ordinary high water mark of the open drainage course shall be
in accordance with the following table:
Contribut ing Drainage Area Minimum Buffer Width
10 to 40 acres 30 feet
40 to 160 acres 50 feet
160 to 2,200 acres 60 feet
Greater than 2,200 acres 100 feet
15 - 307 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
All stormwater management systems shall have an operation and maintenance plan (O&M plan) to ensure
that systems function as designed. This plan shall be reviewed and approved at the same time as the
stormwater management plan required under Section 15-302 above.
1. The O&M plan shall, at a minimum, include:
a. Contact information regarding the owner of the stormwater management system.
b. Contact information regarding the party responsible for operation and maintenance
c. A schedule for inspection and maintenance
d. The routine and non-routine maintenance tasks to be undertaken
e. An inspection and maintenance log sheet to record the results of the inspection.
2. The City reserves the right to inspect and to require the owner to perform maintenance on private
stormwater management systems, or other stormwater facilities on private property. Maintenance of
such systems and facilities shall ordinarily be the responsibility of the property owner and shall
include all necessary and proper maintenance including without limitations:
a. Debris removal and cleaning
Ord. No. 1822 - Stormwater Regulations
b. Cutting of vegetation
c. Repair of erosion
d. Removal of silt
e. Maintenance of structural facilities.

The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirement which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. Use of the requirement contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty or any kind by the City, or its officers and employees, nor shall approval of a stormwater management plan imply that the land uses permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff. The requirements of this Article were established to consider historical records of average rainfall and engineering and scientific methods. However, larger storms may occur or stormwater run-off heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The provisions of the Article, therefore, shall not be deemed to create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
