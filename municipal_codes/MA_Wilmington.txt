and groundwater;
59
(2) contamination of drinking water supplies;
(3) contamination of clam flats and other coastal areas;
(4) alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat; and
(5) flooding.
Regulation of illicit connections and discharges to the municipal storm drain system is
necessary for the protection of the Town of Wilmington’s natural resources, municipal
facilities, and to safeguard the public health, safety, welfare and the environment.

system impacted, paying the cost for such cleaning or for paying any penalties
assessed by the Town.
Septage – No person shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged any
septage, or septage tank or cesspool overflow into the Town’s storm water
drainage system.
Storage & Disposal of Hazardous Material – No one shall dispose of anything
other than clear water into the Town’s storm drainage system. The disposal of
waste, gasoline or any other hazardous material into the storm drainage system
is strictly prohibited and is in violation of various state and federal pollution
laws.
Private drainage systems – It is prohibited for anyone with a private drainage
system from tying into the public storm water disposal system without a permit
from the Department of Public Works. The maintenance of any and all private
drainage systems shall be the responsibility of the owners.
49.9 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM ACCESS
The Department may suspend municipal storm drain system access to any person or
property without prior written notice when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge of pollutants that presents imminent risk of harm to the public
health, safety, welfare or the environment. In the event any person fails to comply with
an emergency suspension order, the Authorized Enforcement Agency may take all
reasonable steps to prevent or minimize harm to the public health, safety, welfare or the
environment.
49.10 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge
permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said
permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Department of Public Works prior to
the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
49.11 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
This Section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges associated with
industrial activity, including construction activity.
1) Access to Facilities – The BOH and DPW (or other enforcement
agency/delegated enforcement partner) shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this by-law as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this by-law, subject to applicable law. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
2) Facility operators shall allow the BOH and DPW ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of
records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
64
storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal laws.
3) The BOH and DPW shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge.
4) The BOH and DPW have the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow
and quality shall be calibrated to ensure they are accurate.
5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility
to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the
written or oral request of the BOH and DPW and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
6) Unreasonable delay in allowing the BOH or DPW access to a permitted facility
constitutes a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this by-law. A
person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm
water associated with industrial activity violates this Section 49 if the person
denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
by-law.
7) If the BOH or DPW has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this by-law, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this by-law or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
49.12 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s
lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of
trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate,
or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner
or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse. Compliance with this by-law does not waive the
responsibility of the property owner or lessee for applying for and receiving any other
required Town, State or Federal permits associated with activities or uses otherwise
regulated under other regulatory jurisdiction (e.g. Wetlands Protection Act).
49.13 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS
Notwithstanding other requirements of local, state or federal law, as soon as a person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility
or operation has information of or suspects a release of materials at that facility or
operation resulting in or which may result in discharge of pollutants to the municipal
drainage system or waters of the Commonwealth, the person shall take all necessary steps
to ensure containment, and cleanup of the release. In the event of a release of oil or
hazardous materials, the person shall immediately notify the municipal fire and police
departments. In the event of a release of non-hazardous material, the reporting person
shall notify the Authorized Enforcement Agency no later than the next business day. The
reporting person shall provide to the Authorized Enforcement Agency written
65
confirmation of all telephone, facsimile or in-person notifications within three business
days thereafter. If the discharge of prohibited materials is from a commercial or
industrial facility, the facility owner or operator of the facility shall retain on-site a
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such
records shall be retained for at least three years.
49.14 ENFORCEMENT
The BOH or an authorized agent of the BOH shall enforce this by-law, regulations,
orders, violation notices, and enforcement orders, and may pursue all civil and criminal
remedies for such violations.

If a person violates the provisions of this Section 49, regulations,
permit, notice, or order issued thereunder, the BOH may seek
injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or
compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
49.14.2. Orders
The BOH or an authorized agent of the BOH may issue a written order
to enforce the provisions of this section or the regulations thereunder,
which may include: (a) elimination of illicit connections or discharges
to the MS4; (b) performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; (c)
that unlawful discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
and (d) remediation of contamination in connection therewith.
A. If the enforcing person determines that abatement or
remediation of contamination is required, the order shall set
forth a deadline by which such abatement or remediation must
be completed. Said order shall further advise that, should the
violator or property owner fail to abate or perform remediation
within the specified deadline, the Town may, at its option,
undertake such work, and expenses thereof shall be charged to
the violator.
B. Within thirty (30) days after completing all measures
necessary to abate the violation or to perform remediation, the
violator and the property owner will be notified of the costs
incurred by the Town, including administrative costs. The
violator or property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount or basis of costs with the Department within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification of the costs
incurred. If the amount due is not received by the expiration
of the time in which to file a protest or within thirty (30) days
following a decision of the Department affirming or reducing
the costs, or from a final decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction, the costs shall become a special assessment
against the property owner and shall constitute a lien on the
owner’s property for the amount of said costs pursuant to
M.G.L. Ch. 40, §58. Interest shall begin to accrue on any
unpaid costs at the statutory rate provided in G.L. Ch. 59, § 57
after the thirty-first day at which the costs first become due.
49.14.3. Non-Criminal Disposition
As an alternative to criminal prosecution or civil action, the Town may
elect to utilize the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in G.L.
Ch. 40, §21D and in which case the Health Director and DPW Director
of the Town shall be the enforcing person. The penalty for the 1st and
66
all subsequent violations shall be $300.00. Each day or part thereof
that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
49.14.4. Criminal Penalty
Any person who violates any provision of this by-law, regulation, order
or permit issued thereunder, shall be punished by a fine of $300.00.
Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall

notify the individual fingerprinted that the fingerprints will be used to
check the individual's criminal history records. The Police Chief shall
periodically check with the Executive Office of Public Safety and
Security (“EOPSS”) which has issued an Informational Bulletin which
explains the requirements for town by-laws and the procedures for
obtaining criminal history information, to see if there have been any
updates to be sure the Town remains in compliance.
74
53.1.2 State and National Criminal Records Background Checks. Upon
receipt of the fingerprints and the appropriate fee, the Police
Department shall transmit the fingerprints it has obtained pursuant to
this by-law to the Identification Section of the Massachusetts State
Police, the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information
Services (DCJIS) and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or
the successors of such agencies as may be necessary for the purpose of
conducting fingerprint-based state and national criminal records
background checks of license applicants specified in this by-law.
53.1.3 Authorization to Conduct Fingerprint-Based State and National
Criminal Record Background Checks. The Town authorizes the
Massachusetts State Police, the Massachusetts Department of Criminal
Justice Information Systems (DCJIS) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), and their successors as may be applicable, to
conduct fingerprint-based state and national criminal record
background checks, including of FBI records, consistent with this bylaw.
The Town authorizes the Police Department to receive and utilize
State and FBI records in connection with such background checks,
consistent with this by-law. The State and FBI criminal history will not
be disseminated to unauthorized entities. Upon receipt of a report from
the FBI or other appropriate criminal justice agency, a record subject
may request and receive a copy of his/her criminal history record from
the Police Department. Should the record subject seek to amend or
correct his/her record, he/she must take appropriate action to correct
said record, which action currently includes contacting the
Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services
(DCJIS) for a state record or the FBI for records from other
jurisdictions maintained in its file. An applicant that wants to challenge
the accuracy or completeness of the record shall be advised that the
procedures to change, correct or update the record are set forth in Title
28 CFR 16.34. The Police Department shall not utilize and/or transmit
the results of the fingerprint-based criminal record background check to
any licensing authority pursuant to this by-law until it has taken the
steps detailed in this paragraph.
53.1.4 Municipal officials should not deny an applicant the license based on
information in the record until the applicant has been afforded a
reasonable time to correct or complete the information, or has declined
to do so. The Police Department shall communicate the results of
fingerprint-based criminal record background checks to the appropriate
governmental licensing authority within the Town as listed. The Police
Department shall indicate whether the applicant has been convicted of,
or is awaiting final adjudication for, a crime that bears upon his or her
suitability or any felony or misdemeanor that involved force or threat of
force, controlled substances or a sex-related offense.
53.1.5 Regulations. The Board of Selectmen is authorized to promulgate regulations
for the implementation of the proposed by-law, but in doing so it is
recommended that they consult with the Chief of Police, Town Counsel and the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (or its successor
agency) to ensure that such regulations are consistent with the statute, the FBI’s
requirements for access to the national database and other applicable state laws.
53.2 Use of Criminal Record by Licensing Authorities. Licensing authorities of the
Town shall utilize the results of fingerprint-based criminal record background
75
checks for the sole purpose of determining the suitability of the subjects of the
checks in connection with the license applications specified in this by-law. A
Town licensing authority may deny an application for a license on the basis of
the results of a fingerprint-based criminal record background check if it
determines that the results of the check render the subject unsuitable for the
proposed occupational activity. The licensing authority shall consider all
applicable laws, regulations and Town policies bearing on an applicant's
suitability in making this determination.
The Town or any of its officers, departments, boards, committees or other
licensing authorities is hereby authorized to deny any application, including
renewals and transfers thereof, for any person who is determined unfit for the
license, as determined by the licensing authority, due to information obtained
pursuant to this by-law.
53.3 Fees. The fee charged by the Police Department for the purpose of conducting
fingerprint-based criminal record background checks shall be determined by the
Board of Selectmen and shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). The
Town Treasurer shall periodically consult with Town Counsel and the
Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services regarding the proper
municipal accounting of those fees. A portion of the fee, as specified in Mass.
Gen. Laws Chapter 6, Section 172B 1/2, shall be deposited into the Firearms
Fingerprint Identity Verification Trust Fund, and the remainder of the fee may
be retained by the Town for costs associated with the administration of the
fingerprinting system.
53.4 Effective Date. This by-law shall take effect May 4, 2013, so long as the
requirements of G.L. Chapter 40 Section 32 are satisfied. (Adopted 5/4/13, approved
by AG 8/20/2013)

revocation.
SECTION 19. This act shall be submitted for acceptance to the qualified voters of the Town of Wilmington at
the first state election after the date of approval of this act. The vote shall be taken by ballot in accordance with
the provisions of the General Laws, so far as the same shall be applicable, in answer to the question, which shall
be placed upon the official ballot to be used at said election: - "Shall an act passed by the General Court in the
year nineteen hundred and fifty, entitled 'An Act establishing a Town Manager form of government for the
Town of Wilmington', be accepted by this town?" If a majority of the voters voting on this question shall vote
in the affirmative, said act shall take effect immediately for the purposes of the next following town election,
and for all things pertaining thereto, and shall take full effect upon the qualification of a majority of the
selectmen first elected as provided in Section three. If this act is rejected by the qualified voters of the town
when first submitted under this section, it shall be further submitted to the said voters at the second next
following annual town election, and if accepted by a majority of the voters voting thereon it shall take effect as
herein before provided. If a majority of the voters voting on this question when so further submitted shall vote
in the negative, this act shall thereupon become void.
SECTION 20. Duties of Certain Town Officials relative to Election. It shall be the duty of the selectmen and
Town Clerk in office and any other town official upon whom by reason of his office a duty devolves under the
provisions of this act, when this act is accepted by the registered voters as herein provided, to comply with all
the requirements of law relating to elections, to the end that all things may be done necessary for the
nomination and election of the officers first to be elected under this act.
SECTION 21. At any time after the expiration of three years from the date of acceptance of this act, and not
less than sixty days before the date of an annual meeting, a petition signed by not less than ten percent of the
registered voters of the town may be filed with the selectmen, requesting that the question of revoking the
acceptance of this act be submitted to the voters. The selectmen shall thereupon direct the Town Clerk to cause
the said question to be printed on the official ballot to be used at the next annual town election in the following
form: "Shall the acceptance by the Town of Wilmington of an act passed by the General Court in the year
nineteen hundred and fifty, entitled 'An Act establishing a Town Manager form of government for the Town of
Wilmington' be revoked?" If such revocation is favored by a majority of the voters voting thereon, this act shall
cease to be operative on and after the annual meeting next following such vote. All general laws respecting
town administration and town officers, and any special laws relative to said town, the operation of which has
been suspended or superseded by acceptance of this act, shall be revived by such revocation and shall continue
to be in full force and effect. By-laws in force when such revocation takes effect, so far as they are consistent
with general laws respecting town administration and town officers and with special laws relating to said town,
shall not be affected thereby, but any other by-laws inconsistent with such general or special laws shall be
annulled. If such revocation is not favored by a majority of the voters voting thereon, no further petition
therefore shall be filed under this section oftener than once in every three years thereafter.

of way and a straight line connecting points on sidelines 25 feet from the point of
intersection of side street rights of way.
In any district, no building need provide a greater front yard than the average front yard
on the adjoining side lots. In determining such average, a vacant lot shall be
considered as conforming to the required front yard. In determining such average
where an adjoining side lot is a corner lot having two frontages, only the frontage
sharing the same street as the subject lot shall be used to calculate the average front

which this Zoning Bylaw, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted. However, in the
case of the issuance of a building or special permit, construction or operation there
under shall conform to the provisions of this Bylaw unless the construction or use has
commenced within a period of not more than twelve months after the issuance of the
permit and, in cases involving construction, such construction is continued through to
completion expeditiously. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and
structures may continue, provided that no modification of the use or structure is
accomplished, unless authorized hereunder.
6.1.3 Nonconforming Uses - The Board of Appeals may issue a special permit to change or
extend a nonconforming use only if it determines that such change or extension shall
not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the
neighborhood. The Board of Appeals shall not allow an existing nonconforming use to
be changed to another nonconforming use.
6.1.4 Nonconforming Structures - The Board of Appeals may issue a special permit to
allow the reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change of a nonconforming structure,

variance from the Board of Appeals; provided, however, that this provision shall not
apply to nonconforming single and two family residential structures, which shall be
governed by Section 6.1.6 below.
6.1.6 Pre-Existing Nonconforming Single and Two Family Residential Structures Pre-
Existing Nonconforming single and two family residential structures may be
reconstructed after voluntary demolition, extended, altered, or structurally changed
upon the issuance of a building permit after a determination by the Inspector of
Buildings that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not
increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. The following three situations shall
be deemed to not increase the nonconforming nature of the structure and shall be used
in the determination by the Inspector of Buildings. All other situations including, without
limitation, the extension of an exterior wall, vertically or horizontally, at or along the
same nonconforming distance within a required yard, shall be deemed to increase the
nonconforming nature of the structure and shall require the issuance of a special permit
pursuant to Section 6.1.6.4.

encroaches upon one or more required yard or setback areas, where the
reconstruction, extension, alteration or change will comply with all current setback,
yard, building coverage and building height requirements.
6.1.6.4 In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the nonconforming
nature of a single or two family residential structure would be increased by the
proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the Board of Appeals
may, by special permit, allow such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change
where it determines that the proposed modification will not be substantially more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure.

6.2.8 Definitions
6.2.8.1 Area of Special Flood Hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area
may be designated as Zone A, AO, AH, AE, VE or V.
6.2.8.2 Base Flood means the flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
6.2.8.3 Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to building or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
6.2.8.4 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the National
Flood Insurance Program. FEMA provides a nationwide flood hazard area
mapping study program for communities as well as regulatory standards for
development in the flood hazard areas.
6.2.8.5 Flood Boundary and Floodway Map means an official map of a community
issued by FEMA that depicts, based on detailed analyses, the boundaries of the
100-year and 500-year floods and the 100-year floodway. (For maps done in 1999
and later, information previously found on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map
is incorporated in the FIRM Map and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map has
been eliminated.
6.2.8.6 Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.

land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation.
6.2.8.8 Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement or cellar). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement

built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design
requirements of NFIP Regulations 60.3.
6.2.8.9 New Construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. For the purpose of
determining insurance rates, new construction means structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM
or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.
6.2.8.10 One-Hundred-Year Flood - see BASE FLOOD
6.2.8.11 Special Flood Hazard Area means an area having special flood and/or floodrelated

building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within
180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
37
the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, or floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance coverage purposes,
means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is
principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a
manufactured home on foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a
building while in the course of construction, alteration, or repair, but does not
include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction,
alteration, or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed
building on the premises.
6.2.8.14 Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
6.2.8.15 Substantial Improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement.
This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”,
regardless of the actual repair work performed.

Law.
6.4.3.2 For all other uses under Section 6.4.1.1, relief from the parking regulations may be
authorized by a special permit from the Planning Board under this section, provided
that the Planning Board finds (1) that in the case of a change in use of an existing
facility the use to which the premises subject to such regulations are to be put is not
different in kind in its effect on the neighborhood from an existing use so that a literal
application of such parking regulations would be unreasonable or (2) in all other
cases including new construction that the desired relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the neighborhood from the intent and purpose of this By-
Law. In either case the petitioner shall submit a site plan of the off street parking
facilities and the Planning Board shall make its determination based upon all matters
arising under this By-Law.
In considering special permit requests for relief from parking regulations under this
Section 6.4.3.2, the Planning Board shall have the authority to consider off-site
parking for any particular application before the Board, provided, however, that said
off-site parking meets the following minimum criteria:
a. All off-site parking as proposed by any application shall be on a
parcel directly abutting the parcel or use seeking relief under the
provisions of this Section. The word “abutting” pursuant to this
paragraph shall include only parcels abutting the property for which
relief is sought.
b. The party seeking relief from the Planning Board under this Section
6.4.3.2 has provided to the Planning Board sufficient information to
evidence a written and recordable document showing that the
applicant has a permanent parking easement on the abutting, off-site
parcel allowing for sufficient parking for the applicant’s proposed use.
The determination under this paragraph as to the sufficiency of any
written easement documents provided to the Board shall be in the
sole discretion of the Planning Board.
c. Any special permits granted by the Planning Board under this section
related to relief relative to off-site parking for non-residential uses
shall be for the uses as enumerated in the special permit application
only, and shall not be valid for any subsequent change of use. The
Planning Board shall include language to this effect in issuing any
special permit under this section for relief from parking regulations
based on available off-site parking. Any change in use after the
45
issuance of a special permit under this section, which special permit
would have been granted based on available off-site parking, shall
require a new application to the Planning Board for relief from this
section.
6.4.4 Site Design Standards
6.4.4.1 General Regulations - Site design and construction standards are intended to

6.8 Wireless Communications Facilities
6.8.1 Purpose -The purpose of these regulations is to minimize adverse impacts of wireless
communications facilities, satellite dishes and antennas on adjacent properties and
residential neighborhoods; minimize the overall number and height of such facilities to
only what is essential; and promote shared use of existing facilities to minimize the
need for new facilities.
6.8.2. Compliance with Federal and State Regulations:
All wireless communications facilities shall be erected, installed, maintained and used
in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including
radio frequency emission regulations as set forth in Section 704 of the 1996 Federal
Telecommunications Act, as the same may be amended from time to time.
6.8.3 Location
The Wireless Communications Services District is herein established as an overlay
district and shall be superimposed on the other districts established by this Bylaw. All
requirements of the underlying zoning district shall remain in full force and effect,
except as may be specifically superseded herein. Wireless communications facilities
58
shall be prohibited at any other location in Town. Description of areas in the district is
as follows:
a. All land owned by the Town of Wilmington from time to time which is held in the
care, custody, management and control of the Board of Selectmen or the Water &
Sewer Commission.
b. All land located in the General Business (GB), General Industrial (GI) and Highway
Industrial (HI) districts.
c. Applicants for a Special Permit to construct wireless communications facilities are
encouraged to explore alternative types of systems other than mounted systems
on newly constructed towers. Wireless communications antennas (including
panels) may be mounted on or attached to existing structures (including, without
limitation, water towers and church steeples) in any zoning district by Special
Permit provided that they be properly screened and conform to applicable design
requirements as set forth in Section 6.8.
6.8.4 General Requirements
6.8.4.1 No wireless communications facility may be erected except upon the issuance of a
Special Permit by the Board of Appeals and Site Plan approval as set forth in
Section 6.5 of the Zoning Bylaw and subject to all of the provisions of this section.
6.8.4.2 The only wireless communications facilities allowed are free-standing monopoles,
with associated antenna and/or panels; facilities, with associated antennas and/or
panels mounted on, or supported in whole or in part by, any existing building or
structure; and any Wireless Communications facility, with associated antennae
and/or panels located wholly within any existing building or structure. Lattice style
towers and similar facilities requiring three or more legs and/or guy wires for
support are not allowed.
6.8.4.3 All owners and operators of land used in whole or in part for a wireless
communications facility and all owners and operators of such wireless
communications facility shall, as a continuing condition of installing, constructing,
erecting and using a wireless communications facility, permit other public utilities
or FCC-licensed commercial entities seeking to operate a wireless
communications facility to install, erect, mount and use compatible wireless
communications equipment and fixtures on the equipment mounting structure on
reasonable commercial terms provided that such co-location does not materially
interfere with the transmission and / or reception of communication signals to or
from the existing wireless communications facility, and provided that there are no
structural or other physical limitations that make it impractical to accommodate the
proposed additional wireless communications equipment or fixtures. Since it is the
intent of these regulations to minimize the number of Wireless Communication
facilities which will be required to be located within the Town, the Board of Appeals
may, as a condition of any Special Permit, require that such specially permitted
Wireless Communications facility be designed to accommodate the co-location of
the maximum number of wireless communications installations technically
practicable in light of the anticipated suitability of the site for other wireless carriers.
6.8.4.4 Any proposed extension in the height, construction of a new facility, and/or
replacement of a facility, shall require an amendment to the Special Permit.
Addition/replacement of antennas or panels and/or co-location on existing
structures may be permitted by the Planning Board during site plan review, if such
work fully complies with Section 6.8.6.6 below.
6.8.4.5 New facilities shall be considered by the Board of Appeals only upon a finding by
the Board of Appeals that (a) the applicant has used reasonable efforts to co59
locate its proposed wireless communications facilities on existing or approved
facilities, and (b) either the applicant was unable to negotiate commercially
reasonable lease terms with the owner of any existing or approved facility that
could accommodate the proposed facilities from both structural engineering (i.e.
the height, structural integrity, weight bearing and wind-resistant capacity of the
existing or approved facility) and radio frequency engineering (i.e. height, coverage
area, etc.) perspectives; or there neither exists nor is there currently proposed any
facility that could accommodate the proposed facilities from structural and radio
frequency engineering perspectives.
6.8.4.6 The Town acting through its Planning Board or Board of Appeals may require the
applicant to pay reasonable fees for review of the applicant’s proposal by a
professional or radio frequency engineer or other qualified professional.

located by a distance equal to the overall vertical height of the monopole and any
attachments plus five feet, unless the applicant demonstrates that due to
topography and/or other characteristics of the site lesser setbacks shall not pose
any public safety danger to any adjacent properties.
6.8.5.4 Antenna or dishes located on a structure shall not exceed ten feet in height above
the roof-line of the structure, unless the Board of Appeals finds that a greater
height is essential to the proper functioning of the wireless communication services
to be provided by the applicant at such location. For structures where it is difficult
to determine the roofline, such as water tanks, the height of the antennae or dishes
shall not exceed ten feet above the highest point of the structure.
6.8.5.5 Screening Requirements - All exterior wireless communications facilities
equipment and fixtures shall be painted or otherwise screened or colored to
minimize their visibility to abutters, adjacent streets and residential neighborhoods.

shall be developed/provided concurrently and proportionately with the development of marketrate
housing units. Segmenting land or properties over any ten-year period with the effect of

units shall be affordable to eligible households. The affordability requirements of this
Section do not apply to density bonus unit(s) (Section 6.11.5.2).
In the event that a development providing on- or off-site units has a fractional affordable
housing unit of 0.5 or greater, it shall be rounded up to the next whole number. In the

6.11.5.3 Methods of Providing Affordable Housing Units
On-site units are the preferred method of providing affordable housing units under this
Section.
As an alternative to on-site provision of affordable housing units, an applicant subject to
this Section may also be allowed by the Board as part of the Special Permit to develop,
construct, rehabilitate or dedicate affordable housing units off-site, only in unique and
extraordinary circumstances, for which the applicant must provide a narrative to meet
this criterion.
70
All requirements of this Section that apply to on-site provision of affordable housing
units shall apply to provision of off-site affordable housing units, except as provided for
in Section 6.11.6.2.b.
6.11.6 Siting and Design
6.11.6.1 Siting and Type of Affordable Housing Units
On-site affordable housing units constructed or otherwise provided under this Section
shall be proportionately distributed throughout the project in terms of both location and
unit size/type. For example, a development consisting of a mix of single-family homes,
townhouses, and a small apartment building shall include affordable housing units of
each housing type. On-site affordable housing units shall also, on average, be as
accessible to common amenities, such as open space or services, as the market-rate
housing units in the same development.
Applications to the Planning Board shall include a plan showing the proposed locations
of the affordable housing units.
6.11.6.2 Minimum Design and Construction Standards
On- and off-site affordable housing units shall comply with the DHCD LIP’s minimum
design and construction standards for SHI as they may be amended. Requirements for
the following conditions shall be complied with as specified, in addition to compliance
with the above.
a. New construction of market-rate and affordable housing units. Affordable housing
units shall be comparable in size, number of bedrooms, design, appearance,
construction and quality of materials with market-rate housing units, though
designer and high-end finishes, fixtures and appliances are not required.
Mechanical systems and energy efficiency shall conform to the same
specifications as apply to the market-rate housing units. Affordable housing units
shall have the same floor area as the median market-rate housing units of the
same number of bedrooms. The number of bedrooms in affordable housing units
shall be comparable to the bedroom mix in market-rate housing units in the
development, unless otherwise required to count on the SHI.
b. Affordable housing units provided on- or off-site by restricting existing homes as
affordable housing units, rather than creating new construction. Units do not have
to appear similar in terms of design and appearance to market-rate housing units.
Home inspections by a licensed inspector are required, and all systems and
major items must have more than ten (10) years of useful life remaining.
6.11.7 Marketing and Affordability of Affordable Housing Units
6.11.7.1 Marketing Plan
Applicants under this bylaw shall submit a marketing plan which describes how the
affordable housing units will be marketed to potential homebuyers. The plan shall meet
all requirements of DHCD and applicable state and federal laws and regulations so that
the affordable housing units are eligible to be placed on the Town’s SHI. No Building
Permit for any units in the development subject to this Section shall be issued until the
marketing plan is approved by DHCD.
6.11.7.2 Local Preference
The maximum local preference units under DHCD guidelines shall be provided.
6.11.7.3 Income Requirements and Selling/Renting Prices
71
The maximum housing purchase price or rent for affordable housing units created
under this Section shall be consistent with affordability guidelines established by DHCD
or a successor agency for eligible households, and shall not exceed the maximum
purchase price or rent guidelines of the program used to qualify affordable housing
units for inclusion on the SHI.
6.11.7.4 Preservation of Affordability
As a condition of development, all affordable housing units provided under this Section
shall be subject to an affordable housing restriction in a form consistent with LIP or any
other applicable guidelines issued by DHCD, acceptable to the Planning Board, and that
ensures affordable housing units can be counted toward Wilmington’s SHI. The
affordable housing restriction shall run with the land and be in force in perpetuity or for
the maximum period allowed by law, and be enforceable under the provisions of M.G.L.
Chapter 184, Section 26 or Sections 31 and 32.
The affordable housing restriction shall contain limitations on use, occupancy, resale
price and rents, and provide for periodic monitoring, by the Town or its designee as
named in the deed rider as the monitoring agent, to verify compliance with and enforce
said restriction. The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed under this
Section shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by the Town, consistent with
model riders prepared by Department of Housing and Community Development,
granting, among other things, the Town, or its designee, a right of first refusal to
purchase the property in the event that a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be
located.
The affordable housing restriction shall provide that in the event that any affordable
rental unit is converted to a condominium unit, the condominium unit shall be restricted
in perpetuity to ensure that it remains affordable to households in the same income
range as prior to the condominium conversion.
The occupancy permit for any units in the development shall not be issued until the
Regulatory Agreement in a form and format acceptable to the Town and DHCD is
recorded at the Registry of Deeds or Registry District of the Land Court, and a copy
provided to the Planning Board.
The affordable housing restriction shall provide that initial sales and rentals of
affordable housing units and subsequent re-sales and re-rentals shall comply with
federal, state and local fair housing laws, regulations, and DHCD LIP guidelines.
The applicant shall be responsible for preparing and complying with any documentation
that may be required by DHCD to qualify affordable units for listing on the Chapter 40B
SHI as LIP units.
6.11.8 Fees
The applicant shall be responsible for all consultant fees, including engineering, architectural,
legal, housing consultant and planning fees, incurred by the Planning Board in connection with
the application, review of relevant plans and documents, and ensuring that the affordable
housing units are included on the Town’s SHI.
6.11.9 Conflict with Other Bylaws or Sections
The provisions of this Section shall be considered supplemental of existing sections of the
Wilmington Zoning Bylaw. To the extent that a conflict exists between this Section and others,
the more restrictive section, or provisions therein, shall apply.
6.11.10 Severability
In the event that one or more of the provisions of this Section are found or determined to be
illegal or unenforceable, or held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such finding shall
not affect the validity of any other provisions of this Section, which provisions will remain in full
force and effect.

taxes. It shall be provided that common charges are to be allocated
74
among the dwelling owners in proportion to their ownership or beneficial
interests in the corporation, non-profit organization or trust, and that each
dwelling owner's share of the common charge shall be a lien against his
real estate in the Planned Residential Development, which shall have
priority over all other liens with the exception of municipal liens and first
mortgages of record, and
o The method by which such instrument or instruments may be amended.
7.2.7 Limitation of Subdivision - No lot shown on a plan for which a Planned Residential
Development permit is granted may be further subdivided, and a notation to this effect
shall be placed on the plan of record which shall be recorded with the special permit.

SECTION 8. CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN
8.1 Purpose and Intent
8.1.1. Primary purposes:
a. To allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments;
b. To encourage the permanent preservation of open space, forest, wildlife habitat, and
historical resources;
c. To encourage a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes
less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features better than a
conventional subdivision;
d. To protect wetlands, aquifers, the Ipswich River, and other waterbodies through water
conserving landscapes, reduction of impervious surfaces, and promotion of on-site
wastewater treatment;
e. To minimize overall environmental disturbance on a site;
f. To facilitate the construction and maintenance of housing, streets, utilities, and public
services in a more economical and efficient manner;
8.1.2 Secondary Purposes:
a. To preserve and enhance community character;
b. To promote the preservation of remaining agricultural land and pastures;
c. To protect the value of real property;
d. To reduce the impact of new development on existing residential neighborhoods.
8.2 Eligibility
8.2.1 There is no minimum tract size for Conservation Subdivision Design. This Conservation
Subdivision Design bylaw is an option for any proposed subdivision.
77
8.2.2 Any proposed residential development on a parcel or contiguous parcels under
common ownership of more than 20 acres shall submit a Conservation Subdivision
Design application to the Planning Board. After submittal, the developer maintains the
option of proceeding with either a conservation subdivision or a conventional
subdivision.
8.2.3 Zoning Classification: Only those tracts wholly (or partially) in residential districts shall
be eligible for consideration as a CSD. If any portion of a tract is outside of a residential
district, that portion of the site shall not be considered in the determination of the Basic
Maximum Number of Housing Units, but shall be eligible to count as open space.
8.2.4 Contiguous Parcels: To be eligible for consideration as a CSD, the tract shall consist of
a single parcel or multiple parcels held under common ownership or site control.
8.2.5 Land Division: To be eligible for consideration as a CSD, the tract or tracts may be a
subdivision or a division of land pursuant to M.G.L. c. 41, s. 81; provided, however, that
CSD may also be permitted where intended as a condominium on land not divided or
subdivided.
8.2.6 Permissible Uses: Land uses within a CSD development may include the following:
single-family homes, both attached and detached; two-family structures; and multifamily
structures (townhouses, apartments, condominiums). The mix of housing types shall be
in accordance with the Site Specific Design Standards outlined in Section 8.10.2.1
below. Within CSD developments of more than 50 housing units, the CSD application
may also include no more than 1000 sq. ft. for a convenience retail business catering
primarily to residents of the development and the surrounding neighborhood.
8.3 Special Permit Required - The Wilmington Planning Board may authorize a Conservation
Subdivision Design project pursuant to the granting of a Special Permit. Special Permits
shall be acted upon in accordance with all provisions below.
8.4 Pre-Application
8.4.1 Conference: The applicant is very strongly encouraged to request a pre-application
review at a regular business meeting of the Wilmington Planning Board. If such a
review is requested, the Planning Board shall invite the Conservation Commission,
Board of Health, Historical Commission, and other bodies as appropriate. The purpose
of a pre-application meeting is to minimize the applicant's cost of engineering and other
technical experts, and to commence negotiations with the Planning Board at the earliest
possible stage in the development. At the pre-application review, the applicant may
outline the proposed CSD, seek preliminary feedback from the Planning Board, other
Boards and Commissions, or other experts. The applicant may also set a timetable for
submittal of a formal application. At the request of the applicant, and at the expense of
the applicant, the Planning Board may engage technical experts to review the informal
plans of the applicant and to facilitate submittal of a formal application for a CSD
permit.
8.4.2 Submittals: In order to facilitate review of the proposed CSD at the pre-application
stage, applicants are encouraged to submit the following information.
8.4.2.1 Site Context Map. This map illustrates the parcel in connection to its surrounding
neighborhood. Based upon existing data sources and field inspections, it should
show various kinds of major natural resource areas or features that cross parcel
lines or that are located on adjoining lands. This map enables the Planning Board
to understand the site in relation to what is occurring on adjacent properties.
8.4.2.2 Existing Conditions/Site Analysis Map. This map familiarizes officials with existing
conditions on the property. Based upon existing data sources and field
78
inspections, this base map locates and describes noteworthy resources that
should be left protected through sensitive subdivision layouts. Resources depicted
on the existing conditions maps should include wetlands, riverfront areas,
floodplains and steep slopes, but may also include mature un-degraded
woodlands, hedgerows, farmland, unique or special wildlife habitats, historic or
cultural features (such as old structures or stone walls), unusual geologic
formations and scenic views into and out from the property. By overlaying this plan
onto a development plan the parties involved can clearly see where conservation
priorities and desired development overlap/conflict.
8.4.2.3 Other Information. In addition, applicants are invited to submit the information set
forth in Section 8.6.1 in a form acceptable to the Planning Board.
8.4.3 Site Visit. Applicants are very strongly encouraged to request a site visit by the Planning
Board and/or the Planning and Conservation Director in order to facilitate preapplication
review of the CSD. If such a site visit is requested, the Planning Board shall
invite the Conservation Commission, Board of Health, the Historical Commission, and
other bodies as appropriate.
8.4.4 Design Criteria. The parties should discuss the design process and criteria set forth
below in Section 8.5 at the pre-application conference and site visit.
8.5 Design Process - At the time of the application for a special permit for a CSD project in
conformance with Section 8.6 the applicant shall demonstrate to the Planning Board that the
following Design Process was performed by a registered Landscape Architect, and that this
process was considered in determining the layout of proposed open space, house sites,
streets, and trails.
8.5.1 Step One: Identify Conservation Areas. Identify preservation land in two steps. First,
identify and delineate Primary Conservation Areas, such as wetlands, riverfront areas,
and floodplains regulated by state or federal law or local bylaw, as well as vernal pools
and direct recharge areas for public water supply wells. Also identify Secondary
Conservation areas, including steep slopes, mature woodlands, agricultural land,
meadows, significant wildlife habitat, historical and archaeological features, and scenic
views on to or off of the site. Second, identify and delineate Potentially Developable
Areas. To the maximum extent feasible, the Potentially Developable Area shall consist
of land outside of the Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas.
8.5.2 Step Two: Locate House Sites. Locate the approximate sites of individual houses
within the Potentially Developable Area and include the delineation of private yards and
shared amenities, so as to reflect an integrated community. The number of homes
enjoying the amenities of the development (views, abutting common open space, etc.)
should be maximized.
8.5.3 Step Three: Align the Streets and Trails. Align streets in order to efficiently access the
house lots and minimize impacts to Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas. Also
lay out new pedestrian trails to create connections among houses, conservation areas,
and existing and future streets, sidewalks and trails.
8.5.4 Step Four: Lot Lines. Draw in the lot lines and delineate the common open space.
8.6 Procedures
8.6.1 Application. An Application for a special Permit for a Conservation Subdivision Design
project shall be submitted on the form(s) provided by the Planning Board in accordance
with the subdivision rules and regulations of the Board. Applicants for a CSD special
permit shall also submit to the Planning Board 16 copies of a Concept Plan.
79
8.6.2 The Concept Plan shall include a Sketch Plan and a Yield Plan (see section 8.7). The
applicant shall submit both the Site Context Map and Existing Conditions / Site Analysis
Map prepared according to Section 8.4.2 above. Additional information reasonably
necessary to make the determinations and assessments cited herein shall be provided,
including existing site contour maps and existing soil maps.
8.6.2.1 Sketch Plan: The Sketch Plan shall be prepared by a registered Landscape
Architect, or by a multidisciplinary team of which one member must be a registered
Landscape Architect. The Sketch Plan shall identify Primary and Secondary
Conservation Areas, and shall address the general features of the land, and give
approximate configurations of the lots, open space, roadways, and trails. The
Sketch Plan shall demonstrate the four-step design process described in Section
8.5 above, and the Design Standards outlined in Section 8.10 below. The Sketch
Plan shall include the following:
a. The Subdivision Name, boundaries, north point, date, legend, title “Concept
Plan," and scale.
b. The names of the record owner, the applicant, and the name of the registered
landscape architect who prepared the plan.
c. The names, approximate location, and widths of adjacent streets.
d. The proposed topography of the land shown at a contour interval no greater
than 2 feet in areas proposed for development, and no greater than ten feet in
areas that will not be developed or altered. Elevations shall be referred to
mean sea level.
e. The location of existing landscape features, including wetlands; forests; fields;
meadows; riverfront areas; waterbodies; archaeological and historic structures
or features; rock outcrops; stone walls; high points; views; major tree
groupings; noteworthy tree specimens; rare habitats; and habitats of rare,
endangered, or threatened wildlife. Proposals for all features to be preserved,
demolished, removed, or relocated shall be noted on the Sketch Plan.
f. All on-site local, state, and federal regulatory resource areas and buffer zones.
All wetland flag locations shall be numbered and placed on the Sketch Plan.
g. Lines showing proposed private residential lots, as delineated during Step Four
of the Design Process (Section 8.5.4), with approximate areas and
dimensions.
h. The location of all existing and proposed features and amenities, including
trails, recreation areas, pedestrian and bicycle paths, community buildings, and
off street parking areas. A brief narrative shall be provided, as necessary, to
explain features on the Plan.
i. The existing and proposed lines of streets, ways, common driveways,
easements, and any parcel of land intended to be dedicated for public use or
to be reserved by deed covenant for use of all property owners in the
subdivision, or parcels of land or lots to be used for any purpose other than
private residential uses, shall be so designated within the subdivision in a
general manner.
j. Proposed roadway grades.
k. In general, official soil percolation tests for the purpose of siting wastewater
treatment options are not required for the concept plan. However, a narrative
explanation shall be prepared by a certified Professional Engineer detailing the
80
proposed wastewater systems that will be utilized by the development and its
likely impacts on-site and to any abutting parcels of land. For example, the
narrative will specify whether individual on-site systems (conventional or
alternative Title 5 systems), shared on-site systems, or any combination of
these or other methods will be used.
l. A narrative explanation prepared by a certified Professional Engineer
proposing systems for stormwater drainage and its likely impacts on-site and to
any abutting parcels of land. For example, the narrative will identify the
structural and non-structural engineering methods that will be used and the
number of any detention/retention basins or infiltrating catch basins; it is not
intended to include specific pipe sizes. Any information needed to justify this
proposal should be included in the narrative. The approximate location of any
stormwater management detention/retention basins shall be shown on the plan
and accompanied by a conceptual landscaping plan. Specific stormwater
management design information is not required for the Concept Plan.
However, the development must meet the stormwater management standards
outlined in the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (regardless of whether
the project falls under Wetlands Protection Act jurisdiction). Approval of the
Planning Board will be contingent on the development meeting these
standards.
m. A narrative explanation prepared by a certified Professional Engineer detailing
the proposed drinking water supply system.
n. A narrative explanation of the proposed quality, quantity, use, and ownership of
the open space. Open Space parcels shall be clearly shown on the plan.
o. All proposed landscaped and buffer areas shall be noted on the plan and
generally explained in a narrative.

development, including any Conservation Restrictions, land transfers, and
Master Deeds, with an accompanying narrative explaining their general
purpose.
q. A narrative indicating all requested waivers, reduction, and modifications as
permitted within the requirements of this bylaw.
8.6.2.2 Yield Plan: Applicant shall submit a narrative explanation detailing the results of
the determination of any proposed allocation of yield determined according to
Section 8.7, Basic Maximum Number, below.
8.6.3 Relation between Concept Plan and Definitive Subdivision Plan: The Concept Plan
special permit shall be reconsidered if there is substantial variation between the
Definitive Subdivision Plan and the Concept Plan, as determined by the Planning
Board. If the Planning Board finds that a substantial variation exists, it shall hold a
public hearing on the modifications to the Concept Plan. A substantial variation shall
be any of the following:
8.6.3.1 Any increase in the number of building lots or the number of housing units;
8.6.3.2 A significant >10% decrease in the open space acreage;
8.6.3.3 A significant change in the lot layout;
8.6.3.4 A significant change in the general development pattern which adversely affects
natural landscape features and open space preservation, including a significant
81
increase in the amount of land proposed to be cleared of trees (either temporarily
or permanently);
8.6.3.5 Significant changes to the stormwater management facilities;
8.6.3.6 Significant changes in the wastewater management systems; or
8.7 Basic Maximum Number of Housing Units
8.7.1 The Basic Maximum Number of Housing Units shall be no greater than the number of
single-family units permissible under conventional subdivision development. The Basic
Maximum Number of Units shall be derived from a Yield Plan. The Yield Plan shall
show the maximum number of single family house lots that could be created upon the
site through a conventional subdivision of land. The Yield Plan shall contain a level of
detail sufficient to determine the maximum yield of a tract. Yield plans shall
demonstrate conformity to all Zoning, Health, and Environmental regulations, including
dimensional requirements, maximum impervious surface, property line setbacks,
wetland setbacks, riverfront restrictions, Title 5 requirements, local or state stormwater
management requirements, and design and construction requirements outlined in the
Wilmington Subdivision Rules and Regulations.
8.7.2 The proponent shall have the burden of proof with regard to the Basic Maximum
number of lots (or dwelling units) resulting from the design and engineering
specifications shown on the Yield Plan.
8.8 Reduction of Dimensional Requirements - The Planning Board encourages applicants to
modify lot size, shape, and other dimensional requirements for lots within a CSD, subject to
the following limitations:
8.8.1 Lots having reduced area or frontage shall not have frontage on a street other than a
street created by the CSD; provided, however, that the Planning Board may waive this
requirement where it is determined that such reduced lot(s) will further the goals of this
bylaw.
8.8.2 At least 50% of the required setbacks for the district shall be maintained in the CSD
unless a reduction is otherwise authorized by the Planning Board.
8.8.3 Lot frontage shall not be less than 50 feet. The Planning Board may waive this
requirement where it is determined that such reduced frontage will further the goals of
the bylaw.
8.9 Open Space Requirements
8.9.1 Open Space. A minimum of 35% of the tract shown on the development plan shall be
open space. Any proposed open space--unless conveyed to the Town of Wilmington,
the Wilmington Conservation Commission, or a local or regional open space land trust--
shall be subject to a permanent recorded deed restriction enforceable by the Town,
providing that such land shall be perpetually kept in an open state, that it shall be
preserved exclusively for the purposes set forth herein, and that it shall be maintained
in a manner which will ensure its suitability for its intended purposes.
8.9.1.1 The percentage of the open space that is wetland shall not significantly exceed the
percentage of the entire tract which is wetland; provided, however, that the
applicant may include a greater percentage of wetlands in such open space upon
a demonstration that such inclusion promotes the purposes of this bylaw.
8.9.1.2 The open space shall be contiguous. Contiguous shall be defined as being
connected. Open Space will still be considered connected if it is separated by a
82
roadway, driveway, pathway, or accessory amenity. The Planning Board may
waive this requirement for all or part of the required open space where it is
determined that allowing non-contiguous open space will promote the goals of this
bylaw and/or protect identified primary and secondary conservation areas.
8.9.1.3 The bulk of the open space shall not be in buffer strips, undeveloped 'fingers'
between house lots, or other narrow linear forms.
8.9.1.4 The open space shall be used primarily for wildlife habitat, conservation, and
passive recreation. The Planning Board shall also permit where appropriate the
following uses: historic preservation, outdoor education, active recreation, parks,
agriculture, horticulture, or a combination of these uses. The open space shall be
served by suitable access for all stated purposes. If the open space is conveyed to
the Town, Conservation Commission, or a local or regional land trust, provisions
for public access shall be made, including signage. The Planning Board may
permit up to 10% of the open space to be paved or built upon for structures
accessory to the dedicated use or uses of such open space (i.e., pedestrian walks,
bike paths, and parking for public visitors to the open space).
8.9.1.5 Wastewater disposal facilities and stormwater management systems serving the
CSD may be located within the open space. However, these systems shall not
qualify towards the minimum open space required. Land upon which wastewater
disposal facilities (including leach fields) are located shall remain under the
possession of a homeowners association or similar entity dedicated to the
maintenance of such facilities even if the balance of the open space is conveyed to
another entity.
8.9.2. Ownership of the Open Space. The open space shall, at the Planning Board's election,
be conveyed to:
8.9.2.1 The Town or its Conservation Commission;
8.9.2.2 A nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open
space and any of the purposes for such open space set forth above;
8.9.2.3 A corporation or trust owned jointly or in common by the owners of lots within the
CSD. If such a trust or corporation is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with
conveyance of the house lots (or condominiums) in perpetuity. Maintenance of
such open space and facilities shall be permanently guaranteed by such
corporation or trust which shall provide for mandatory assessments for
maintenance expenses to each lot. Each such trust or corporation shall be
deemed to have assented to allow the Town to perform maintenance of such open
space and facilities, if the trust or corporation fails to provide adequate
maintenance, and shall grant the town an easement for this purpose. In such
event, the town shall first provide 14 days written notice to the trust or corporation
as to the inadequate maintenance, and, if the trust or corporation fails to complete
such maintenance, the town may perform it. Each individual deed, and the deed
or trust or articles of incorporation, shall include provisions designed to effect these
provisions. Documents creating such trust or corporation shall be submitted to the
Planning Board for approval, and shall thereafter be recorded.
8.10 Design Standards -The following Generic and Site Specific Design Standards shall apply to
all CSD developments and shall govern the development and design process:
8.10.1 Generic Design Standards
8.10.1.1 The landscape, including topography, tree cover, and natural drainage ways, shall
be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil
removal. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
83
the neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual building sites shall
be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover.
8.10.1.2 Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and
preserve natural topography, significant landmarks, and trees; to minimize cut and
fill; and to preserve and enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel,
insofar as practicable.
8.10.1.3 Mixed-use development shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and the use,
scale, and architecture of existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or
visual relationship to the proposed buildings. Proposed buildings shall be related to
their surroundings.
8.10.1.4 All open space (landscaped and usable) shall be designed to add to the visual
amenities of the area by maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or
overlooking it from nearby properties.
8.10.1.5 The removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures, or
architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable, whether these
exist on the site or on adjacent properties.
8.10.2 Site Specific Design Standards
8.10.2.1 Mix of Housing Types. The CSD may consist of single-family (attached or
detached), two-family and multifamily residential structures, or a combination of
these housing types. A multifamily structure shall not contain more than 6 dwelling
units.
8.10.2.2 Where the CSD development will include a mix of housing types, the developer
shall seek to place single family houses towards the perimeter of the site,
especially where it abuts residentially zoned and occupied properties. Within the
site, residential structures shall be oriented toward the street serving the premises
and not the required parking area.
8.10.2.3 Multifamily structures shall be sited and screened to minimize any potential
negative visual impact on abutting single-family structures, both on and off site.
8.10.2.4 Parking. Each dwelling unit shall be served by two off-street parking spaces,
except where the development is located within 1/2 mile of an MBTA commuter rail
station, in which case each dwelling unit shall be served by no less than 1.5 offstreet
parking spaces. Parking spaces in front of garages may count in this
computation. Resident parking for multifamily structures shall be placed to the
side or rear of the building, and the primary pedestrian / visitor entrance shall face
the street. All parking areas with greater than six spaces shall be screened from
view.
8.10.2.5 Developers are encouraged to provide outdoor living spaces, such as porches, on
the front of residential structures, facing the street.
8.10.2.6 Buffer Areas. A vegetated buffer area of 30 feet shall be provided at the following
locations: (a) the perimeter of the property where it abuts residentially zoned and
occupied properties; (b) Conservation Areas, including ponds, wetlands, streams
and riverfront areas, agricultural or recreational fields, and land held for
conservation purposes; and (c) existing public ways. Driveways necessary for
access and egress to and from the tract may cross such buffer areas. No
vegetation in this buffer area will be disturbed, destroyed or removed, except for
normal maintenance of structures and landscapes approved as part of the project.
The Planning Board may modify or waive the buffer requirement in these locations
84
when it determines that a smaller buffer (or no buffer) will suffice to accomplish the
objectives set forth herein.
8.10.2.7 Drainage and Stormwater Management. All CSD developments shall conform to
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act Stormwater Management Standards
(regardless of whether the project falls under Wetlands Protection Act jurisdiction).
Developers shall seek to reduce the amount of impervious surface through the
use of shared driveways, parking lots of gravel or pervious pavement, and
reduction in the width of streets. Development shall not increase the peak rate of
discharge for the two-,ten-, and 100-year storms. Stormwater management
systems shall recharge to groundwater as much water as possible. Appropriate
water quality treatment best management practices shall be used for runoff from
roads and driveways. All rooftop runoff shall be infiltrated on site. A landscape
architect should be employed to develop screening and landscaping for structural
stormwater management facilities (swales, detention ponds, etc.)
8.10.2.8 Roadways. Developers shall balance the need to minimize the amount of paved
surface on the site with the need to route roadways carefully in order to minimize
environmental impact. Developers shall establish a right-of-way no greater than
50 feet. The Planning Board will consider permitting reduction of roadway width or
other Roadway and Driveway Design Requirements (outlined in the Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land) in order to reduce environmental
impacts of the development, so long as the proponent demonstrates that such
reduction will not decrease pedestrian and vehicular safety and or impeded access
for emergency vehicles.
8.10.2.9 Common/Shared Driveways. Common or shared driveways are permitted in CSD
developments. Driveways serving single residences shall be 10-12 ft. in width,
and those serving multiple residences 16-20 feet in width, unless the proponent
demonstrates that increased widths are necessary to ensure vehicular and
pedestrian safety or to provide access for emergency vehicle.
8.10.2.10 Pedestrian and Bicycle Connections. Walkways and bicycle paths shall be
provided to link residences with parking areas, open spaces, and recreation
facilities. Developers shall also create pedestrian and bicycle links to off site land
uses, including nearby key destinations (schools, neighborhood activity centers,
recreational facilities) and existing or proposed segments of the town's trail
network.
8.10.2.11 Disturbed Areas. Not more than 65% of the site shall be disturbed areas. A
disturbed area is any land not left in its natural state. Undisturbed areas may be
within the common open space or within individual house lots.
8.10.2.12 Landscaping. Developers shall employ a landscape architect to design landscape
features harmonious with the site's natural state and will make water conservation
a priority for the landscape design. Drought-resistant plantings are strongly
encouraged. The size of individual and common lawns should be minimized.
Developers are encouraged to use natural, low-maintenance grasses and meadow
plantings for open areas.
8.11 Decision of the Planning Board - The Planning Board may grant a special permit for a
proposed CSD development if it determines that the proposed project has less detrimental
impact on the property and surrounding areas than a conventional development proposed
for the tract, after considering the following factors:
8.11.1 Whether the CSD achieves greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential
developments than a conventional plan;
85
8.11.2 Whether the CSD promotes permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land
forestry land, other natural resources including waterbodies and wetlands, and
historical and archeological resources;
8.11.3 Whether the use of CSD reduces the impacts of development on the Ipswich River and
other waterbodies, through the reduction of water consumption, by minimizing
impervious surfaces, and through the use of on-site or decentralized wastewater
management systems.
8.11.4 Whether the CSD promotes a less sprawling and more efficient form of development
that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features
better than a conventional subdivision;
8.11.5 Whether the CSD reduces the total amount of disturbance on the site;
8.11.6 Whether the CSD furthers the goals and policies of the open space plan and
Wilmington Master Plan;
8.11.7 Whether the CSD facilitates the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities, and
public service in a more economical and efficient manner;
8.11.8 Whether the CSD contributes to increasing the diversity of available housing in
Wilmington;
8.11.9 Whether the Concept Plan and its supporting narrative documentation complies with all
sections of this zoning bylaw; or do anything in relation thereto.

9.12.2 Any proposed open space, unless conveyed to the Wilmington Conservation
Commission, or a local or regional conservation land trust, shall be subject to a
permanent recorded deed restriction enforceable by the town, providing that such be
perpetually kept in an open state, that it shall be preserved exclusively for the purposes
set forth herein, and that it shall be maintained in a manner which will ensure its
suitability for its intended purposes.
9.12.3 The percentage of the open space that is wetland shall be proportionate to, and shall
not exceed, the percentage of the entire tract which is wetland. However, the Planning
Board may waive this requirement if it determines that such waiver would promote the
purposes of this bylaw.
9.12.4 The open space shall be contiguous. For the purposes of this subsection, open space
shall be considered "contiguous" if it is separated by a roadway, driveway, pathway, or
accessory amenity. The Planning Board may waive this requirement for all or part of
the required open space where it is determined that allowing non-contiguous open
space will promote the goals of this bylaw and/or protect identified conservation areas.
9.12.5 The bulk of the open space shall not be in buffer strips, undeveloped "fingers" between
structures, or other narrow linear forms.
9.12.6 The open space shall be used primarily for wildlife habitat, conservation, and passive
recreation. The Planning Board shall also permit where it deems appropriate the
following uses: historic preservation, outdoor education, active recreation, parks,
agriculture, horticulture, or a combination of these uses. The open space shall be
served by suitable access for all stated purposes. If the open space is conveyed to the
Conservation Commission or a local regional land trust, provisions for public access
shall be made, including signage. The Planning Board may permit up to 10% of the
open space to be paved or built upon for structures accessory to the dedicated use or
uses of such open space (i.e., pedestrian walks, bike paths, and parking for public
visitors to the open space).
9.13 Design Criteria
90

the applicant shall secure the required improvements for streets, ways, drainage, and other
items specified by the Planning Board with a performance guarantee.
9.15 Revisions and Amendments - Following the approval of an Over 55 housing development,
any change in the layout of streets and ways; in the configuration or ownership of the open
space; or any change which would alter the character of the development, shall require the

forty-five (45) days shall indicate no desire to comment by said agency. The necessary
number of copies of the application shall be furnished by the applicant. The SPGA
must indicate in their decision why they varied from any recommendation of the
agencies to which the proposal was referred.

professional at the site of the proposed activity.
10.6 Variance - A variance from the specific requirements of the Bylaw, except a variance
authorizing a use or activity not otherwise permitted in a particular zoning district, may be
authorized by the Board of Appeals only where, after notice and a public hearing, the Board
of Appeals specifically finds:
o That there are circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape or topography which
especially affect the land or structure in question, but which do not affect \generally the
zoning district in which the land or structure is located;
o That due to those circumstances especially affecting the land or structure, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Bylaw would involve substantial hardship,
financial or otherwise to the petitioner or appellant;
o That desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from
the intent or purpose of this Bylaw; and
o That desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good.
The Board of Appeals may impose such conditions, safeguards and limitations, both of time
and use, as it deems appropriate upon the grant of any variance. Any rights authorized by a
variance which are not exercised within one year from the date of grant of such variance shall
lapse and may be re-established only after notice and a new hearing pursuant to this
Subsection.
10.7 Bylaw Construction - This Bylaw shall not interfere with or annul any other Town Bylaw,

clauses or provisions of this Bylaw shall not invalidate or impair the Bylaw as a whole or any
other part hereof.

COMPREHENSIVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT BYLAW
SECTION 51.1 AUTHORITY, PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS
51.1.1 AUTHORITY
This Bylaw is adopted under authority granted by the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution,
the Home Rule statutes and pursuant to the regulations of the federal Clean Water Act found at 40 CFR 122.34,
and as authorized by the residents of the Town of Wilmington at Town Meeting, dated May 2, 2009.
51.1.2 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Bylaw is to regulate discharges to the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) to
protect the Town of Wilmington’s water bodies and groundwater and to safeguard the public health, safety,
welfare and the environment. Increased and contaminated stormwater runoff associated with construction sites,
developed land uses and the accompanying increase in impervious surface are major causes of impairment of
water quality and flow in lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands and groundwater. This is accomplished through
the following:
1.2.1 Institute water resource protection measures identified in the Supplemental Final Comprehensive Water
Resource Management Plan / Environmental Impact Report - Commonwealth of Massachusetts EOEA
File Number 8844 (CWRMP);
1.2.2 Protect groundwater and surface water from degradation
1.2.3 Promote groundwater recharge
1.2.4 Require practices to control the flow of stormwater from new and redeveloped sites into the Town storm
drainage system in order to prevent flooding and erosion
1.2.5 Require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation and control the volume and rate of
stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance activities
1.2.6 Prevent pollutants from entering the Town’s municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and minimize
discharge of pollutants from the MS4
1.2.7 Ensure that soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and stormwater runoff control practices are
incorporated into the site planning and design process and are implemented and maintained;
1.2.8 Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of structural stormwater best management
practices so that they work as designed
1.2.9 Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to stormwater discharges; and
1.2.10 Establish the Town’s legal authority to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Bylaw through
inspection, monitoring, and enforcement.
Nothing in this Bylaw is intended to replace the requirements of either, the Town of Wilmington Zoning Bylaw,
General Bylaw, or any other Bylaw that may be adopted by the Town of Wilmington. Any activity subject to the
provisions of the above-cited Bylaws must comply with the specifications of each.

improvements (Existing Lots or Approval Not Required Lots) that disturbs more than 20,000
square feet of land in aggregate (Maximum 4 Lots or less) shall be required to obtain a
Simple Stormwater Management Permit (SSMP) for each lot instead of a SMP.
2.2.2 Any activity that must undergo Site Plan Review per the Wilmington Planning Board Site Plan
Review Rules and Regulations, except that:
a. A Site Plan change of use that does not alter the site and does not trigger Standard 5 of the
Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards (uses with a higher pollutant load)
shall be exempt.
b. A Site Plan Amendment that does not include changes to the site that impact the function of
the stormwater management system on the site shall not require a SMP.
51.2.3 Simple Stormwater Management Permit (SSMP)
A Simple Stormwater Management Permit (SSMP) is required for the following:
2.3.1 Any activity, except as exempted under Section 2.4, that will disturb or alter less than 20,000
square feet of land, or which is part of a common plan for development that will disturb or alter

11.2.2.4 Final Inspection
11.2.3 AS-BUILT PLANS - After the stormwater management system has been constructed and before the
surety has been released, all applicants are required to submit to the Planning Board actual “as built”
plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed and must
be certified by a Professional Engineer. As built plans shall be full size plans, which reflect the “as built”
conditions, including all final grades, developed by a Professional Engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All changes to project design should be recorded in red ink on plans
to define changes made. All work deleted, corrections in elevations, and changes in materials, should be
shown on the as built drawings.
11.3 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL INSPECTION
11.3.1 To ensure erosion control practices are in accord with the filed Erosion and Sediment Control Plan,
Erosion Control Inspections will be conducted by the applicant or its authorized representative at least
once every 7 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater from
the start of construction until the site is permanently stabilized. The permittee is required to notify the
Planning Board of any change in inspection frequency, including termination of inspections due to site
stabilization.
11.3.2 Inspections must be conducted by qualified personnel (provided by the operator or cooperatively by
multiple operators). “Qualified personnel” means a person knowledgeable in the principles and practice
of erosion and sediment controls who possesses the skills to assess conditions at the construction site
that could impact storm water quality and to assess the effectiveness of any sediment and erosion control
measures selected to control the quality of storm water discharges from the construction activity.
11.3.3 Inspections must include all areas of the site disturbed by construction activity and areas used for storage
of materials that are exposed to precipitation. Inspectors must look for evidence of, or the potential for,
pollutants entering the storm water conveyance system. Sedimentation and erosion control measures
identified in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan must be observed to ensure proper operation.
Discharge locations must be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in
preventing significant impacts to waters of the United States, where accessible. Where discharge
locations are inaccessible, nearby downstream locations must be inspected to the extent that such
inspections are practicable. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site must be inspected for
evidence of off-site sediment tracking.
11.3.4 For each inspection required above, an inspection form must be completed and kept on-site, or submitted
to the Planning Board upon request. The form must include the following information, at a minimum:
11.3.4.1 The inspection date
11.3.4.2 Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the inspection
11.3.4.3 Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring at the time of the inspection.
11.3.4.4 Weather information for the period since the last inspection (or since commencement of
construction activity if the first inspection) including a best estimate of the beginning of each
storm event, duration of each storm event, approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event
(in inches), and whether any discharges occurred.
11.3.4.5 Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the site
11.3.4.6 Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained
11.3.4.7 Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a particular
location
11.3.4.8 Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the time of inspection
11.3.4.9 Corrective action required including any changes to the SWPPP necessary and implementation
dates
113.4.10 Corrective actions performed
11.3.5 A record of each inspection and of any actions taken must be retained for at least three years from the
date that permit coverage expires or is terminated. The inspection reports must identify any incidents of
non-compliance with the permit conditions. Where a report does not identify any incidents of noncompliance,
the report must contain a certification that the construction project or site complies with this
permit.

11.3.6 All erosion and sediment control measures and other protective measures identified in the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan must be maintained in effective operating condition. If site inspections identify
BMPs that are not operating effectively, maintenance must be performed as soon as possible and before
the next storm event whenever practicable to maintain the continued effectiveness of storm water
controls.
11.3.7 If existing BMPs need to be modified or if additional BMPs are necessary for any reason, implementation
must be completed before the next storm event whenever practicable. If implementation before the next
storm event is impracticable, the situation must be documented in the SWPPP and alternative BMPs must
be implemented as soon as possible.
11.4 INADEQUACY OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROLS
11.4.1 If the stormwater management system is found to be inadequate by virtue of physical evidence of
operational failure, even though it was built as called for in the Stormwater Management Plan, it shall be
corrected by the applicant before the Stormwater Certificate of Completion is released. If the applicant
fails to act, the Planning Board may use the surety bond to complete the work.
11.4.2 If the erosion and sediment control system is found to be inadequate by virtue of physical evidence of
operational failure, even though it was built as called for in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, it shall
be corrected by the applicant upon notice. If the Planning Board determines that there is a failure to
comply with the erosion and sediment control plan, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the
nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. A Stop Work Order shall be issued until any
violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the Planning Board.
11.4.3 If the Planning Board determines that there is a failure to comply with the stormwater management plan,
the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective
actions. A Stop Work Order shall be issued until any violations are corrected and all work previously
completed has received approval by the Planning Board.

a. The annual recharge volume from the post- development site shall approximate 150% of the annual recharge
volume from pre-development conditions based on soil type for the following types of developments:
i. New subdivisions of 5 or more lots.
ii. New commercial or new industrial development
b. The annual recharge volume from the post- development site shall approximate 100% of the annual recharge
volume from pre-development conditions based on soil type for the following types of developments:
i. New subdivisions of less than 5 lots.
ii. Commercial or industrial redevelopment
c. The above criteria are met when the stormwater management system is designed to infiltrate the required
recharge volume as determined by Tables 1 and 2. For each NRCS Hydrologic Group on the site, the required
recharge volume equals the recharge volume set forth multiplied by the total area within that NRCS Hydrologic
Group that is impervious.

d. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) FOR RECHARGE – Standards a-c listed above and all other
infiltration shall be accomplished using appropriate BMPs as defined in the latest edition of the Massachusetts
Stormwater Handbook. The design of BMPs must follow the guidance provided in the Handbook. For all
non-rooftop recharge, pretreatment shall be provided as specified in the Handbook.
e. RECHARGE NOT FEASIBLE - In some instances due to soil types, groundwater elevations, contaminated
sites, or other unforeseen circumstances, recharge may not be feasible on- site. If the project cannot meet
the recharge requirements listed above, the applicant must demonstrate that an equivalent level of
environmental protection is provided. At the discretion of the Planning Board, the applicant may contribute to
the Water Resources Mitigation Fund as defined in Section 3.8 of the Bylaw.
2. Additional Performance Standards within a Ground Water Protection District (GWPD)
a. To ensure protection of the Ground Water Protection District (GWPD) as defined by the latest version of the Town
of Wilmington Zoning Bylaw, all projects located within a GWPD and subject to a SMP shall, at a minimum,
comply with the performance standards of the most recent version of the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) Stormwater Management Standards and accompanying Stormwater
Management Handbook. These projects shall be subject to the higher water quality standards required for
projects within a Zone II area. BMPs, including those for recharge and pretreatment, must also meet the higher
water quality standards and as specified in the Handbook.
3. Hydrologic Basis for Design of Structural Practices
For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of development sites are as follows:
a. Impervious cover is measured from the site plan and includes any material or structure on or above the ground
that prevents water from infiltrating through the underlying soil. Impervious surface is defined to include, without
limitation: paved parking lots, sidewalks, rooftops, driveways, patios, and paved, gravel and compacted dirt
surfaced roads.
b. The length of sheet flow used in time of concentration calculations is limited to no more than 100 feet for
predevelopment conditions and 100 feet for post development conditions.
c. Detention time for the one-year storm is defined as the center of mass of the inflow hydrograph and the center of
mass of the outflow hydrograph.
d. The models TR-55 and TR-20 (or approved equivalent) will be used for determining peak discharge rates.
e. For purposes of computing runoff, all pervious lands in the site shall be assumed prior to development to be in
good condition regardless of conditions existing at the time of computation.
f. If an off-site area drains to a site or a facility, off-site areas should be included in the model.
g. Determination of flooding and channel erosion impacts to receiving streams due to land development projects
shall be measured at each point of discharge from the development project and such determination shall include
any runoff from the balance of the watershed, which also contributes to that point of discharge.
h. The specified design storms shall be defined as a 24-hour storm using the rainfall distribution recommended by
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) or the
Northeast Regional Climate Center “Atlas of Precipitation Extremes for the Northeastern United State and
Southeastern Canada.”
i. Proposed residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions shall apply these stormwater management criteria to
the land development as a whole. Individual lots in new subdivisions shall not be considered separate land
development projects, but rather the entire subdivision shall be considered a single land development project.
Hydrologic parameters shall reflect the ultimate land development and shall be used in all engineering
calculations.
APPENDIX F: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL ADDITIONAL CRITERIA
All erosion and sediment controls for all projects subject to a Stormwater Management Permit (SMP) shall comply with the
following performance criteria unless otherwise provided for in the Regulations.
Wilmington Stormwater Regulations
Last Revised November 1, 2016
Page 21 of 23
1. General Erosion and Sediment Control Criteria
The following are the minimum General Erosion and Sediment Control Criteria:
a. Minimize total area of disturbance and minimize unnecessary clearing and grading from all construction sites.
Clearing and grading shall only be performed within areas needed to build the project, including structures,
utilities, roads, recreational amenities, post-construction stormwater management facilities, and related
infrastructure.
b. Whenever practicable and feasible, construction shall be phased to limit disturbance to only one area of active
construction at a time. Future phases shall not be disturbed until construction of prior phases is complete and the
land area is stabilized. Mass clearings and grading of the entire site shall be avoided.
c. Interim and permanent stabilization measures shall be instituted on a disturbed area as soon as practicable but
no more than 14 days after construction activity has temporarily or permanently ceased on that portion of the site.
d. Steep slopes shall be protected from erosion by limiting clearing of these areas in the first place or, where grading
is unavoidable, by providing special techniques to prevent upland runoff from flowing down a steep slope and
through immediate stabilization to prevent gullying. Offsite runoff shall be diverted from highly erodible soils and
steep slopes to stable areas.
e. Perimeter sediment controls shall be applied to retain or filter concentrated runoff from disturbed areas to trap or
retain sediment before it leaves a construction site. Uncontaminated water shall also be diverted around
disturbed areas.
f. Sediment trapping and settling devices shall be employed to trap and/or retain suspended sediments and allow
time for them to settle out in cases where perimeter sediment controls (e.g., silt fence and hay bales) are deemed
to be ineffective in trapping suspended sediments on-site. Sediment basins shall also be used to minimize peak
rate of runoff in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Standards.
g. Off-site transport of sediment, including off-site vehicle tracking, shall be prevented.
h. Dust and debris shall be controlled at the site.
i. On and off-site material storage areas, including construction and waste materials, shall be properly protected
and managed.
2. Specific Erosion and Sediment Control Criteria
The following are the minimum Specific Erosion and Sediment Control Criteria:
a. Prior to any land disturbance activities commencing on the site, the applicant or its agent shall physically mark
limits of no land disturbance on the site with tape, signs, or orange construction fence, so that workers can see
the areas to be protected. The physical markers shall be inspected daily.
b. Appropriate erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed prior to soil disturbance. Measures shall be
taken to control erosion within the project area. Sediment in runoff water shall be trapped and retained within the
project area. Wetland areas and surface waters shall be protected from sediment.
c. Erosion and Sediment Control measures shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s
specifications and good engineering practices.
d. Sediment shall be removed once the volume reaches ¼ to ½ the height of a hay bale or sedimentation fence
shows signs of failure.
e. BMPs to be used for infiltration after construction shall not be used as BMPs during construction unless otherwise
approved by the Board. Many infiltration technologies are not designed to handle the high concentrations of
sediments typically found in construction runoff, and thus must be protected from construction related sediment
loadings.
f. Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each workday. Stockpile side slopes shall not be
greater than 2:1. All stockpiles shall be surrounded by sediment controls.
g. Disturbed areas remaining idle for more than 14 days shall be stabilized with seeding, wood chips bark mulch,
tarpaulins, or any other approved methods.
Wilmington Stormwater Regulations
Last Revised November 1, 2016
Page 22 of 23
h. For active construction areas such as borrow or stockpile areas, roadway improvements and areas within 50 feet
of a building under construction, a perimeter sediment control system shall be installed and maintained to contain
soil.
i. A tracking pad shall be constructed at all entrance/exist points of the site to reduce the amount of soil carried onto
roadways and off the site.
j. On the cut side of roads, ditches shall be stabilized immediately with rock riprap or other non-erodible liners, or
where appropriate, vegetative measures.
k. Permanent seeding shall be undertaken in the spring from March through May, and in late summer and early fall
from August to October 15. During the peak summer months and in the fall after October 15, when seeding is
found to be impractical, an appropriate temporary mulch shall be applied. Permanent seeding may be undertaken
during the summer if plans provide for adequate mulching and watering.
l. All slopes steeper than 3:1 (h:v, 33.3%), as well as perimeter dikes, sediment basins or traps, and embankments
must, upon completion, be immediately stabilized with sod, seed and anchored straw mulch, or other approved
stabilization measures. Areas outside of the perimeter sediment control system must not be disturbed.
m. Temporary sediment trapping devices must not be removed until permanent stabilization is established in all
contributory drainage areas.
n. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site stabilization. Disturbed soil
areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized within 30 days of
removal.

TOWN OF WILMINGTON PLANNING BOARD
RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND IN THE
TOWN OF WILMINGTON
SECTION I: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
A. Purpose
These Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in the Town of Wilmington
(“Subdivision Rules and Regulations”, “Subdivision Regulations” or “these Regulations”) are
adopted under the provisions of Chapter 41, Sections 81K-GG of Massachusetts General Law
(“the Subdivision Control Law”) for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, welfare, and
convenience of the inhabitants of the Town of Wilmington and of adjoining communities that
may be impacted by the construction of a subdivision in the Town of Wilmington. These
Regulations govern the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to
the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary
conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open areas.
These Regulations are comprehensive, reasonably definite, and carefully drafted so that owners
and developers may know in advance what is or may be required of them and what standards
and procedures will be applied to them. While these Regulations establish standards to be
specifically applied by the Wilmington Planning Board in terms of providing guidance as to what
is to be required of owners and applicants, these Regulations are also intended to provide the
Planning Board with adequate flexibility to tailor decisions to specific facts and circumstances.
The powers of the Wilmington Planning Board under the Subdivision Control Law shall be
exercised with due regard for the provision of the following:
1. Adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient
for travel;
2. For lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways;
3. For reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles;
4. For securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic, and other emergencies;
5. For ensuring compliance with the Town of Wilmington Zoning Bylaw;
6. For securing adequate provision for water, sewage, drainage, underground utility services,
fire, police, and other similar municipal equipment, and street lighting and other
requirements where necessary in a subdivision;
7. For coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the
Town and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions;
8. For ensuring that public facilities and services are available concurrent with any
development. These facilities and services shall have sufficient capacity to serve the
2
proposed subdivision. In accomplishing this purpose, the Town of Wilmington will be
required to bear no cost for the provision of necessary on-site or off-site facilities, services,
and improvements by requiring the developer to pay fees, furnish land, undertake
construction, or establish mitigation measures to ensure that the development provides
adequately for the capital facility needs generated by the development. As it relates to the
provision of adequate public facilities including roadways, water, sewer, and other facilities
for a proposed subdivision, the Wilmington Planning Board shall consider off-site
conditions and may require such improvements to be provided at no cost to the Town.
It is the intent of the Subdivision Control Law that any Subdivision Plan filed with the Planning
Board shall receive the approval of the Board if said plan conforms to the Subdivision Control
Law, the recommendations of the various Town Departments and to the Rules and Regulations
Governing the Subdivision of Land in the Town of Wilmington, provided, however, that the
Board may but is not required to waive, as provided for in Section II(E) herein and M.G.L.
Chapter 41, Section 81R, strict compliance with some or all of the Subdivision Rules and
Regulations when such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and
purpose of the subdivision control law.
B. Authority
Under the authority vested in the Planning Board of the Town of Wilmington by Subdivision
Control Law, M.G.L. Chapter 41, Section 81Q, said Board hereby adopts these Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in the Town of Wilmington. Under the above
authority, the Wilmington Planning Board shall insist on strict conformance with the standards
established in these Regulations in all cases, except where a waiver of conditions pursuant to
these Regulations is granted.
C. Compliance with Rules and Regulations
a. Unapproved Subdivision Prohibited
No person may make a subdivision, as defined in the Subdivision Control Law, of any land
within the Town of Wilmington, proceed with the improvement or sale of lots in an
unapproved subdivision or the construction of a street or the installation of municipal
services within them, or undertake preliminary steps, such as the clearing of land, excavation,
site preparation, or other preparatory steps, leading to the construction of a street or the
installation of municipal services or facilities, for which requirements or standards are in
these Regulations, unless and until a Definitive Subdivision Plan has been submitted,
approved, and endorsed by the Planning Board and recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the
Land Court, and only then according to the conditions of approval and the procedures as set
out in these Regulations.
b. Issuance of Building Permits
The Building Inspector shall not issue any permit for the erection of a building until he or
she is first satisfied that the lot on which the building is to be erected is not within a
subdivision or if it is within a subdivision, that a way furnishing the access to such lot as
required by the Subdivision Control Law is shown on a plan recorded or entitled to be
recorded under M.G.L. Chapter 41, Section 81X, as amended, and that any condition
endorsed thereon limiting the right to erect or maintain buildings on such lot have been
satisfied or waived by the Board, and in the event that more than one (1) building for
dwelling purposes be erected or placed or converted to use as such on any lot, that the
3
Building Inspector is satisfied that consent has been obtained from the Planning Board in
accordance with Section II(C) of these Rules and Regulations and M.G.L. Chapter 41,
Section 81Y and amendments thereto. No building shall be erected on any lot within a
subdivision that is subject to a covenant that has not been released.
D. Consistency with State Law
In case of conflict between these Regulations and State Law, and for matters not covered by
these Regulations, then Subdivision Control Law, as it may from time to time be amended, shall
apply.
a. Severability
The provisions of these Regulations are severable. If any provision of these Regulations, or
any decision or determination in the administration of them, is adjudged by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, invalid, or void, the court’s decision does not
affect any other provision of these Regulations or the administration of them or any prior
approval issued pursuant to the Regulations in effect at the time of that approval.
b. Invalidation by Changes to State Law
Any part of these Regulations that may later be deemed invalid by a new State Law, or by
amendment of an existing State Law, shall to the extent possible be construed and applied so
as to conform to the new or amended State Law, and such construction will be deemed
effective immediately, without requirement for a public hearing and the required procedures
for amendment and repeal of these Regulations.
E. Forms
The Planning Board may create forms for the convenient administration of these Regulations.
These forms are not part of these Regulations. Forms may be added or deleted and the content
of the forms may be revised from time to time by administrative action of the Planning Board.

include re-subdivision, and, when appropriate to the context, shall
relate to the process of subdivision or the land or territory
subdivided; provided, however, that the division of a tract of land
into two (2) or more lots shall not be deemed to constitute a
6
subdivision within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law, if at
the time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has a
frontage on (a) a public way, or a way which the Town Clerk of the
Town of Wilmington certifies is maintained and used as a public
way, or (b) a way shown on a plan theretofore approved and
endorsed in accordance with the Subdivision Control Law, or (c) a
way in existence when the Subdivision Control Law became
effective in the Town, having in the opinion of the Planning Board,
sufficient width, suitable grades, and adequate construction to
provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed
use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby, and for the
installation of municipal services to serve such land and the
buildings erected or to be erected thereon. Such frontage shall be of
at least such distance as is then required by the Zoning Bylaw.
Conveyances or other instruments adding to, taking away from, or
changing the size and shape of lots in such a manner as not to leave
any lot so affected without the frontage above set forth, or the
division of a tract of land on which two (2) or more buildings were
standing when the Subdivision Control Law went into effect in the
Town into separate lots on each of which one (1) of such buildings
remains standing, shall not constitute a subdivision.

as otherwise required for lots within a subdivision.
D. Zoning Bylaw
The Board will not approve or modify and approve any plan of a subdivision of land unless all
buildings, structures, and lots shown on said plan comply with the Zoning Bylaw or a variance
and/or Special Permit from the terms thereof has been granted.
E. Waivers
a. Waiver of Specific Rules and Regulations
In accordance with M.G.L. Chapter 41, Section 81R, the Board may in any particular case,
where such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose
of the Subdivision Control Law, waive strict compliance with these Regulations, and with
the frontage or access requirements specified in these Regulations. An applicant is not
entitled to a waiver and the Board, in its discretion, may decline to approve a request for a
waiver.
b. Application for a Waiver
Any person requesting a waiver must submit the following with the application for approval
of the Subdivision Plan:
1. A written request that identifies the specific provision of these Regulations for which
the waiver is requested;
2. A narrative statement that explains how granting the waiver would be in the public

site would be developed if the plan complied with that provision of these Regulations
and no waiver were granted.
c. Effect of Not Requesting or Granting a Waiver
If a request for a waiver is not submitted, or the Board does not grant a requested waiver,
and one (1) or more features of a proposed plan do not follow these Regulations, the
noncompliance may be the basis of disapproval of the application.
d. Decision on a Request for a Waiver
If the Board waives any provision or standard of these Regulations, it must determine that its
action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the
Subdivision Control Law and of these Regulations.
8
The Board may make its approval of a waiver dependent on such conditions as will achieve
the objectives of the provision or standard waived.
The approved waivers shall be listed on the subdivision plan for endorsement, and the

approved or disapproved.
F. Fees
a. Application Fees
Applications for subdivision approval (Preliminary or Definitive Plans) and Approval Not
Required Plans shall be accompanied by a check payable to the Town of Wilmington in
accordance with the most recent Fee Schedule adopted by the Planning Board.
All expenses for advertising, publication and mailing of notices, recording and filing of
documents, and all other expenses in connection with a Subdivision or Approval Not
Required Plan shall be borne by the applicant.
All administrative fees are due at the time of submittal of an application.
b. Project Review Fees
1. Authority
In addition to administrative fees, the Board may impose a project review fee on those
applications which require, in the judgement of the Board, review by outside consultants
due to the size, scale, or complexity of a proposed project; the project’s potential
impacts; or because the Town lacks the necessary resources to perform the review work
related to the subdivision. In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage
engineers, planners, lawyers, designers, or other appropriate professionals able to assist
the Board and to ensure compliance with all relevant laws, ordinances, bylaws, and
regulations. Such assistance may include, but shall not be limited to, analyzing an
application, monitoring or inspecting a project or site for compliance with the Board’s
decisions or Regulations, or inspecting a project during construction or implementation.
2. Submittal of Project Review Fee
Should the Board require outside review, a project review fee must be submitted to the
Department of Planning & Conservation for deposit in an account established pursuant
to M.G.L. Chapter 44, Section 53G. Failure to make this payment is grounds for denial
of the application.
3. Project Review Fee Account
Expenditures from this account may be made at the direction of the Board without
further appropriation. Expenditures from this account shall be made only for services
rendered in connection with a specific project or projects for which a project review fee
has been or will be collected from the applicant. Accrued interest may also be used for
this purpose. The Board must provide the following information in a timely fashion on
request of the applicant:
9
• A statement of principal and interest based on information from the Town
Accountant;
• A report of all checks authorized for issuance;
• An estimate of bills pending from consultants for work completed or in progress but
not invoiced.
At the completion of the Board’s review of a project, any excess amount in the account,
including interest, attributable to a specific project shall be repaid to the applicant or the
applicant’s successor in interest. A final report of said account shall be made available to
the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest. For the purpose of this regulation,
any person or entity claiming to be an applicant’s successor in interest shall provide the
Board with documentation establishing such succession in interest.
4. Inspection Review Fee
After the approval of a Definitive Subdivision Plan, the Board may require a fee during
construction of said project. Failure to make this payment is grounds for rescission of
approval.
5. Administrative Appeal
Any applicant may make an administrative appeal of the selection of the outside
consultant to the Town Board of Selectmen. Such appeal must be made in writing and
may be taken only within twenty (20) days after the Planning Board has mailed or hand
delivered notice to the applicant of the selection of the outside consultant. The grounds
for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that the consultant selected has a conflict of
interest or does not possess the minimum required qualifications. The minimum
qualifications shall consist either of an educational degree in, or related to, the field at
issue or three (3) or more years of practice in the field at issue or a related field. The
required time limit for action upon an application by the Board shall be extended by the
duration of the administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the
Board of Selectman within one (1) month following the filing of the appeal, the selection
made by the Board shall stand.
6. Delinquent Accounts
The following rules apply to fees owed to the Board:
Due Date: Project review fees and supplemental project review fees are
due within fourteen (14) days from the date that the Board
determines that they are required.
Monthly Interest Charge: All fees past due by one (1) month from the date of invoice
are subject to a monthly interest charge based upon an annual
interest rate of fourteen (14) percent.
Costs of Collection: All costs of collection associated with past due accounts must
be borne by the applicant.
10
Failure to Pay: Failure to pay delinquent fees, interest, or costs of collection
after thirty (30) days’ notice is grounds for denial of an
application or rescission of an approved application.

E. Surety Procedure
Before Planning Board endorsement of the Definitive Plan, the applicant shall provide a
performance guarantee to the Planning Board in order to ensure that the subdivision shall be
constructed in conformance with these Rules and Regulations, the approved plans and the
Board’s decision.
a. Methods of Surety
Such construction of ways and installation of municipal services shall be secured by one, or
in part by one and in part by the other, of the following methods with the written consent of
the Planning Board:
1. Pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 41, Section 81U, the applicant shall provide financial surety
in the form of a performance bond, issued by an agency licensed to do business in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a lender’s agreement that provides for the retention
of sufficient funds otherwise due the applicant, or a deposit of money or negotiable
securities, any of which shall be in an amount determined by the Planning Board to be
sufficient to cover the cost of all or any part of the improvements shown on the plan
necessary to serve any lots not covered by a covenant. Such security, if filed or
deposited, shall be accompanied by an appropriate and properly executed agreement, and
approved as to form and manner of execution by the Town Counsel and as to sureties
26
by the Town Treasurer and shall require the completion of such improvements within
two (2) years of the date of the approval of the Planning Board, unless extended by the
Planning Board in its discretion; or
2. The applicant shall file a form of covenant as the Planning Board requires and as is
approved as to form and manner of execution by the Town Counsel, properly executed
and duly recorded in the Registry of Deeds by the owner of record, running with the
land, whereby such ways and services as specified on the plan and not covered by bond
or deposit, shall be provided to any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed,
other than by mortgage deed, and that no building shall be erected thereon until the
improvements specified are constructed and installed so as to serve the lots in
conformance with the approved plans and the Planning Board’s decision. If an applicant
chooses to secure performance by executing a covenant pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 41,
Section 81U, the following provision shall be included in such covenant:
“The construction of all ways and the installation of all municipal services shall be
completed in accordance with the applicable Rules and Regulations of the Planning
Board within two (2) years from the date that the decision of the Planning Board is filed
with the Town Clerk. Failure to so complete shall automatically rescind approval of the
plan.”
Such conditions shall be secured by a covenant running with the land, referred to on the
plan, and recorded in the Registry of Deeds. When the applicant has completed the
required improvements specified for any lots in a subdivision, the applicant may request
a release of the covenant for said lots. If the Board determines that the improvements
have been completed, the Board will release the covenant by appropriate instrument,
which shall be in proper form for recording in the Registry of Deeds. Thereafter, the
covenant relating to such lots, so released, shall terminate.
b. Surety Reduction
The penal sum of any such bond, or the amount of any deposit held under these Rules and
Regulations may, from time to time, be reduced by the Planning Board and the obligations
of the parties thereto released by said Board in whole or in part. If release is by reason of
covenant, a new plan of the portion to be subject to the covenant may be required by the
Board.
c. Final Release of Surety
Upon final completion of the provisions of the Performance Guarantee or covenant with
respect to any lot, the applicant shall submit to the Planning Board an As-Built Plan and a
written statement that the construction or installation secured by such surety has been
completed in accordance with said Rules & Regulations and with the approved plans. If the
Planning Board determines that said construction or installation has been satisfactorily
completed, it shall release the interest of the Town in such surety, except for ten percent
(10%) of the original net cost of all improvements which shall be held until eighteen (18)
months following completion or the acceptance of the street, whichever first occurs, to
ensure adequate maintenance of and repair of defects in such improvements (“Maintenance
Surety”), after which such Maintenance Surety shall be released to the person who furnished
the same. The Board shall have the authority to access and utilize the Maintenance Surety
27
prior to its release if the applicant fails to satisfactorily maintain the improvements secured
thereby or to repair any defects therein that arise or are discovered prior to its release. If the
Board determines that said construction or installation has not been fully completed, it shall
specify in a notice to the applicant the details where said construction or installation fails to
comply with its Rules & Regulations.
F. Endorsement of Plan
The endorsement of plan approval by the Planning Board shall be valid for a period of one (1)
year from the date of said approval. Prior to the expiration of the one (1)-year approval period,
the developer and/or owner shall request in writing to the Planning Board an extension of time,
if necessary and work has not yet commenced. Failure to request extension of time prior to the
expiration of the one (1)-year approval period shall result in the Planning Board notifying the
Building Inspector that no Building Permits should be issued in said development. The request
for extension shall state reasons for said extension and also the length of time requested.
Extension of time shall not in any case exceed one (1) year. Additional extensions after the first
may be applied for but not until at least ten (10) months have expired on the extension in effect.
G. Time for Completion
The applicant shall complete the ways shown thereon and install the public utilities aforesaid
within two (2) years of the date of approval. If the ways in any subdivision are not completed
and the utilities aforesaid are not installed within the time so agreed to by the applicant or so
required by the Board, no such way shall thereafter be laid out, constructed, completed, or
opened for public use unless and until a new application and Definitive Plan in accordance with
the then in effect Rules and Regulations is filed with and approved by the Board. Ways or
portions thereof not completed within two (2) years from the date of approval by the Board
shall thereafter be completed in accordance with the then in effect design and construction
standards of the Planning Board, unless an extension of time is granted.
H. Confirmation of Recording with the Registry of Deeds
Upon endorsement, the applicant shall record the plan with the Registry of Deeds. Three (3)
complete copies of the plans and two (2) copies of the documents which contain the Registry of
Deeds stamp shall be submitted to the Department of Planning & Conservation as proof of
recording. Work on said subdivision shall not commence prior to the applicant submitting to
the Department of Planning & Conservation proof that the plans and required documents have
been recorded.

system and not overflow onto any neighboring lots.
e. Dead-End Streets
1. For the purposes of this section, any proposed street which intersects solely with a deadend
street shall be deemed to be an extension of the dead-end street. Dead-end streets
and their extensions, if any, shall not be longer than five hundred (500) feet unless in the
opinion of the Board, a greater length is necessitated by topography or other local
conditions and a waiver is granted. Dead-end streets shall be measured from the right-ofway
line of the intersection street. If a dead-end street is longer than one thousand
(1,000) feet, the Board may require a divided roadway.
